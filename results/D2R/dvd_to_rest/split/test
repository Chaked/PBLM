S'\tNot too impressed\n\tThe acting was very good. The pace was adequate. However, the plot was predictable. The movie just reeks of the intelligent thriller syndrome. Clive\'s character kept calling this the perfect robbery. The characters talk about the relative intelligence of the other characters or how the other characters can\'t possibly know what is going on. I\'m still not sure what Jody Foster\'s character brings to the plot.  \n\nAny way, they do stupid things. The bank robbers dig a latrine in a storage closet. You don\'t know the hole is a latrine until the end of the movie. However, they do call it a "s--thole during the movie. They spent hours on this hole. Why not use a bucket instead of a hole in the floor for a latrine? They even brought buckets in with them. They were disguised as painters. Why couldn\'t Clive\'s character use a bucket with chemical treatments instead of a hole in a floor of a bank for a latrine. \n\nFinding plot holes in this movie is like shooting fish in the barrel. Furthermore, the plot is so predictable that it made the movie drag. I have to be honest, I didn\'t guess the ending. I kicked myself for they gave plenty of clues. For example, a big one is the title of the movie. However, the lame clues (the s--thole) acted like red herrings. They threw me off the scent.\n'

aS"\tFor fans of Miyazaki, NOT for fans of the book\n\tI was very excited about this film as a fan of both the book and Ghibli Studios previous works. All the greater the disappointment then, when less than half way through, the story becomes something utterly unrecognizable from the original, several key characters are lumped together most confusingly, and others lose all their complex charm. What a shame. \n\nIf you have never read the book and are a fan of Miyazaki, by all means buy this. You're very likely to enjoy the excellent animation and yet another unusual story from him.\n\nIf you are a fan of the book, steer well clear. You're likely to want to poke Miyazaki with a stick and see if his head turns into a turnip or his turnip into a head.\n"

aS"\tAnd who could that be stalking us now?\n\tAlong with the nanny, the stepdad, the cable guy, the 14-year-old girl with a crush... we now have the PHOTO PROCESSING CLERK to fear! Yes, everyone is out to get us.. or at least that's what Hollywood would have us believe.\n\nI am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort  normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality. No wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion, mistrust, fear (and the resulting isolation) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us.    \n\nYes, films like these have their place. However, I think Hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality.\n"

aS"\tno title\n\tWell, I sure could have skipped this one.  I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me.  Mostly, I was just plain bored.  There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks.  Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President.  And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie.  But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter.\n"

aS"\tThe cell phone is the main character\n\tThe most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone. The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it? \n\nAfter lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them. Mystery #2: how will the cell phone save the day?\n\nMystery #3. Watch for the credits at the end of the film. They show up on a...? Yep, you got it\n"

aS'\tAn Invitation to Open Your Wallet...\n\tWow!  Practice a few vapid platitudes and wield some handy aphorisms and woo-woo sounding phrases, change your voice, and you, too, can be a CHANNELER! For money!  I\'m definitely in the wrong occupation.  Has anybody ever thought to question "Ramtha" on a few specifics that a 35,000 year old being from "Atlantis" should know?  Did Ramtha\'s ancient society speak Indian-accented English?  What an amazing stroke of luck!  What did Ramtha\'s people do for agriculture and diet, how was his/her society structured, what tools did they use, and where was "Atlantis" precisely located?  I\'m certain that archaelogists and anthropologists could benefit from such knowledge that such a wise being could impart after miraculously surviving 35 millenia--or how many years precisely, and in what reckoning?  Could Ramtha show us some writing samples in Atlantean script?  Linguists could help here.  Or--is it just possible that JZ Knight and her kind are great at pulling one over on us because we WANT and NEED to believe?  Isn\'t that a more realistic explanation?  What does that say about those who buy into this?\n'

aS"\tLoaded deck shoots blanks\n\tConsidering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci's The Mercenary or Parolini's Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film\n"

aS'\tOne Starr is far, too much\n\tThose of you who remember Ryan Starr from American Idol know why she quickly became "has been" material for VH1\'s the Surreal Life. Ryan Starr also happens to be the worst actress I have ever watched on film, television and or commercials.  The director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of Ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time.  Her dialogue is kept short and simple, and when she does have more than 3 lines at once, the complete lack of feeling, expression   emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile, like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang-nails.  That is all I can say, I would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again\n'

aS'\tDisingenuous Tripe\n\tWhatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie.  Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and "sparks fly."  As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe.\n\nFrom the movie\'s self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless:  Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians?  Do the production\'s other members? Does that derail the production?  What mayhem ensues? \n\nIn point of fact, however, the single attempt at "comedy" comes from DeLuise\'s portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats.  \n\nThe bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the "actresses" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers.  Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore.  The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise\'s fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic.  There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders.\n\nAbout the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street.  Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters.  Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves.  If so, then this IS bad acting.  If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances.  Sadly, there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film.\n'

aS'\tThis movie is a clunker\n\tWasted talent.  None of the characters are believable in the roles they are portraying.  Some funny stuff.  Craig Ferguson can do better.  Charlotte Church should stick to singing as acting is not her forte.  Every thing in this movie seems forced and there is no chemistry between the characters\n'

aS"\tIs The DVD Cover Familiar To You?\n\tThis is a pure Rip-Off from the cover of Aerosmith's Live Bootleg album from 1978...Where's the shame? Too bad Twilight are not original enough to come up with their own cover.\n\nIn another words, this DVD is pretty suck and the originality here is nowhere to be found...Especially on the cover art that they stole from a much bigger band.\n"

aS'\tDEAD MOVIE\n\tShame on talented actors like Maura Tierney and Jerry Orbach for their involvement in this laughably bad mystery movie.  Uninspired direction with a trite and convoluted script combine with terrible acting to make a movie that has little to recommend it.  "Star"/co-writer John Romo is one of the worst leading men to come around the bend in some time, and this is his only film, and I can see why.  He plays a private investigator who finds himself looking into the murders of several lingerie models whose underwear was designed by Tierney, who also works in a local factory run by Orbach.  Dennis Christopher shows up as a seedy illegal alien investigator; and June Lockhart and Lyle Waggoner lend their names to supporting roles as Tierney\'s estranged parents.  The movie professes to make some statement on the poor treatment of immigrants but it\'s so shoddily included, it makes no statement at all.\nLittle heard of movie; I can see why\n'

aS'\tThis review is more about the movie transfer than the movie\n\tThis review is more about the "SuperBit" transfer of the movie to DVD than the movie itself.  The movie itself is great and I highly recommend it.\n\nHowever, the transfer on to this 2002 "SuperBit" version is very lacking in several areas.  The SUPERBIT idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer.  The original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features (like trailers, documentaries, featurettes, and "Making-Of" snippets) to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality.\n\nThey have failed to do that here.  The video and audio quality are not what they could be.\n\nFirst, the movie is encoded onto a DVD-9 RSDL disc.  This means the DVD is capable of storing 9.5 GB of data.  However, not even 6 GB is used. As a result, the video and audio quality is not what it could be.\n\n"Panic Room" is a 112 minute movie.  Any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a DVD-9 disc at maximum encoding rate, provided no extra features are placed on the disc. The maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour (or less) movie onto a DVD-9 disc is 9.8 Mbps.  However, this SuperBit version averages only 6.5 Mbps.\n\nThis SuperBit version offers audio encoding in 3 types: Dolby 2.0 Surround 192kbps, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1.  At first glance this is great news, until you discover that the DTS encoding isn\'t as high quality as it could be.  The DD 2.0 Surround is presented at a bitrate of 192bkps as expected.  So is the DD 5.1 at the expected 384kbps rate.  DTS 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps, but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps.  This is unsatisfactory given the fact that one-third of the available disc space of the DVD-9 isn\'t even used.  The DTS encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this.  This would represent a 33% increase in filespace for the audio portion, but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear.  The filespace increase would be only about 256 MB, which is very reasonable when you have over 3 GB of space not even being used.\n \nIf they had encoded "Panic Room" on this SuperBit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 Mbps, and removed the trailers and features, they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above, especially the DTS 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate I stated.  \n\nSuch an encoding process would have used 9.4 GB of the 9.5 GB of available space.  A much better way to fill up the DVD-9 disc and adhere to the spirit of the SuperBit ideal.  The result would have been a movie encoded to DVD-9 at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc.\n\nI notice that they will be offering a repackaged SuperBit version in October 2006.  Hopefully that version will fix the flaws I just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both video-wise and audio-wise.  It might even offer the better DD-EX 6.1 and DTS-ES 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many A/V receivers can process now.\n\nAnother thing I am noticing is that many times, for popular movies, they are released them in 2-disc editions.  The first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff.  If the movie contains both DD and DTS encodings on the first disc, with a very high video bitrate of 9.0 Mbps or greater, it is already in the SuperBit mold.\n'

aS"\tFemme Fatales or Very Lame?\n\tTerrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with.

It was a total watse of good celluloid\n"

aS'\tThere\'s no person like this person\n\tBetty Hutton has a colossal amount of energy. She seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining. She\'s a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers. Her voice is sturdy, durable, indestructible.\n\nBut oh my God, her acting choices ... She and the Indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film (whereas Buffalo Bill, allegedly a larger-than-life character, looks like a corpse by comparison, and Howard Keel, in only his second film, must manage to act like these are human beings he\'s relating to). \n\nTake a look at Betty Hutton\'s reaction upon seeing Howard Keel for the first time -- the mugging would be considered "a bit much" if seen from the back row of an amphitheater. At best, her performance is clownlike; at worst, it\'s apelike. Little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity. It\'s a magnificent effort, and a stunning testimony to her desire to please, but her comedy has no reality, no nuance, no connection to any sincere emotion. She seizes on "hick" and drives that into the ground, then she plays nothing but "infatuated" for a while before toggling to "resentful" and so forth ... It\'s a series of masks and set pieces, but it\'s not a character. Judy Garland was in sad shape at that point in her life, but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind Annie\'s rootin\'-tootinest moments, and she wouldn\'t have neglected Annie\'s grit even in the melting sentimental scenes. Nobody can do vulnerability like Judy, and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors -- both qualities that would serve this character. Annie could be a wonderful character, a great self-conflicted mess of strength, longing, guts, femininity, skill, naivete and worldiness, all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man -- but instead Betty Hutton makes her a pop-eyed, crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet. I am surprised that Hutton didn\'t insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out. Maybe they just wouldn\'t let her. The scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh, oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide. \n\nI kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on, and the memory of Betty Hutton\'s performance is branded on my brain, but it\'s because this performance seems like it\'s following the traditions of some other culture, some other world. It\'s like going to a sideshow.\n\nThat said, the tunes are a non-stop parade of hits -- there probably isn\'t any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another, in wildly different styles, with effective melodies worth remembering. The classic tunes just keep coming. The movie works as spectacle and songfest, and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness. But if you\'re looking for a portrayal of a woman with genuine feelings and motivations, you might be distracted by the gorgeous blonde chimpanzee who steals all her scenes.\n'

aS"\tWhat a Letdown!\n\tI love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better\n"

aS'\tVery biased- A HUGE disappointment\n\tWhen I purchased this DVD, I was hoping to get the complete picture- an unbiased presentation. From scratch I could sense what was to come. Bad presentation coupled with one sided propaganda forms the crux of this DVD. It is not well researched and very important issues have been completely omitted. What little was discussed appeared to be very tainted. \nI definitely did not expect National Geographic to come up with this kind of a DVD. I will definitely think TEN times before I purchase anything from them. Maybe they should just stick to wildlife/geography/ecology and leave history/religion/spirituality alone\n'

Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats. \n\nThe movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic.

aS"\tLogo Imprint Compromises Presentation\n\tI was thrilled when I first read that MLB Productions was finally issuing a DVD version of highlights of the Baltimore Orioles' three World Series victories.  I already owned the VHS versions, one of which (the 1970 World Series) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization (watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film).  Finally, I could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 World Series.\nMuch to my dismay, the MLB logo is permanently, and obtrusively, displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs.  What's that all about?  Does MLB Productions think I'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills?  Thank goodness I don't own a plasma TV or I'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years!\nSound and picture quality are okay otherwise.  But....that logo is really annoying\n"

Problem is, the one joke was the one plastered all over the TV spots and trailers (the jet ski incident). The highlights involved the subplot of him teaching a guy to be cool - wish that'd been the main storyline instead - far, far superior! Will not be adding this to my wishlist\n"

Mcginly's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world, he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film Two Days.  i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast (which included hacks like Paul Rudd) was not in the same league as superstars Traci Bingham and Ice-T who have graced some of his previous work.  Please Sean, stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff, leave that to idiots like Capra, Wenders, Scorcese etc.  They are not in your league.\n"

aS'\tFree to Be You and Me - As Long As You Are Like Me\n\tI rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school.  This video made its rounds in the public schools.  The songs are catchy and the film quality is good.  \n\nBut make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children.  I will not be showing it to my kids.\n\nDespite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys.  \n\nCase in point:  Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father\'s horse).  She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time.\n\nJuxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of "ladies first."  The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron.  The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal.\n\nOur "hosts", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting.  There should be a law against using Mel Brooks\' voice for a baby.  Apparently, I repressed memories of these creatures, but seeing them again brought back the horror.  Needless to say, I fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry.\n\nOverall, this DVD is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children\n'

aS'\tHindsight is 20/20\n\tBelieve it or not, I actually wanted to watch this movie.  I\'ve seen almost everything else Adrian Lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts.\n\n(I watched _Jacob\'s Ladder_ because I remembered an intriguing preview on a VHS cassette I watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _Silent Hill_ sealed the deal; My girlfriend owns a copy of Lyne\'s version of _Lolita_; _Fatal Attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental; I watched the TV version of _Indecent Proposal_; I haven\'t seen _9 1/2 Weeks_ but I read the book.) \n\nFlashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you\'ve never seen it.  And I always wanted to hear the song "Maniac" in its original context, so when I found it on an acquaintances shelf I popped it in.\n\nSo, how was it?\n\nNot too bad.  Not great by any means, or even really that good (_Lolita_ and _Jacob\'s Ladder_ are both quite good) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work.  The plot is a by-the-book "believe in your dreams" story with really lame dialog, but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like I was watching an abstract silent film.  I don\'t know squat about dancing, but the choreography seemed innovative, at least for its time.\n\nI can\'t even remember the names of the characters, but all in all, I have to admit that it was kind of neat.\n\nAlso, if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind, _Flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from Hollywood:  It\'s a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials, one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack Joe Esterhasz and was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer!  Taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60% of all crap movies made since\n'

aS"\tA Disappointment\n\tFirst of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.  \n\nSadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.  \n\nMaybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film. \n\nIn addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)\n\nThe only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better\n"

aS"\tWhat's all the fuss about?\n\tBefore I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.\n\nThere are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.\n\nThe animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.\n\nThe only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.\n\nIn short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie.

aS'\tIt is worth seeing, but Michael Morre missed the point\n\tHe thought the columbine incident was about gun control.  It was not.  It was about anger and bullying.  That is the problem.  That is what would have fixed that problem.  We need to help children be better to eachother or problems like this will keep going on.    It is worth seeing because it is interesting, but he is wrong on this one.  Micahel Moore is a good director but people are not always right\n'

aS'\tA wild, wild gimmick\n\tYou want realism of the Old West? Try showing people frequently blowing big wads of snot out their nose and hawking green loogies onto the floor or into their sleeves because they didn\'t have tissues. Try having the actors and actresses go for a couple of months without washing their hair, and not brushing their teeth with toothpaste, so their hair is oily and their mouths are scuzzy and black.\n\nTHAT would be realistic, but it\'s a LOT more repellant to television audiences than gratuitous profanity. So this "realistic" show has characters with clean, fluffy hair and pretty teeth spew garbage langauge constantly -- and sucker viewers and reviewers buy this as "realistic"!!! Every great writer of every age and era, be it Mark Twain, Owen Wister, William Shakespeare, or John Steinbeck, or any other storyteller whose works have survived for generations, told "realistic" stories of their era but who understood what realistic trivia to keep in, and what to leave out, in order to TELL THE STORY. That is WHY their work has remained timeless.\n\nDeadwood\'s writing shows a huge insecurity complex in choosing to rely on a gimmick (and a juvenile one at that) like over-the-top profanity. Whether or not the Calamity Janes of the time actually used the words "ignorant f****ng c***s" is something we will never know and is also absolutely irrelevant.\n\nThere are an awful lot of sheeple in TV land\n'

aS'\tDid we see the same movie??\n\tOkay, the script is not the most imaginative I\'ve ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben\'s best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn\'t even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don\'t they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn\'t even mind the fact that the whole "We\'re married and my husband\'s a doctor." charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he\'s pretending to be a doctor and he\'s on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D\'ya think someone might have a heart attack and "Dr. Holmes" might have to step up?  And uh, they\'re pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there\'s the best man and maid of honor! D\'ya think they\'re gonna get busted?\n\nWhat killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah\'s little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they\'re not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he\'s breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let\'s just go ahead and get married after all.\n\nHuh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn\'t have a clue what he wants in life, and I\'m expected to believe they lived happily ever after?\n\nNot only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us "don\'t do it!" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It\'s just marriage. It\'s romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!\n\nIt\'s been my experience, when things aren\'t feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap\n'

aS'\tDumbest movie ever\n\tThe entire premise of the movie is not merely ludicrous or far-fetched, it is actually completely false.  The concept of double jeopardy has nothing at all to do with WHOM is murdered (or is otherwise the victim), but WHAT you did, in distinct criminal incidents.  Even if you were wrongly convicted of murdering someone, if you go back and murder them "again" then that is a new incident, and double jeopardy does not apply.\n\nIn movies intended to be fantastic, diverging this much from reality might be OK.  But this is a mainstream legal thriller.  It\'s like having a mainstream romantic comedy where the men wear lipstick and the women don\'t, for no apparent reason.\n\nBut the producers of this movie either have no idea what the law actually says or means, or they just (accurately) banked on the general public being too ignorant to notice how ridiculous it is\n'

aS"\tPretty forgotten by now.\n\tThe Forgotten starring Julianne Moore and Domnic West is a slow, tepid, and hard to grasp film. The previews for this film were better than the actual movie, I guess that's a bad sign that the movie isn't going to be great (I'll try and remember that next time). The only reason I am giving The Fogotten 2 stars is the scene with Alfe Woodward, you'll know what I mean when it happens, the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere, very intrguing spurprise awaits. Anyways The Forgotten is a movie you should see once and that's it, happy viewing\n"

I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!!  In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god\'s peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying "Check Please".\n'

aV	I figure if I study high, take the test high, get high scores! Right?\u000a	How High is a film that lends nothing, I repeat, nothing to the film community at large.  I have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the Cheech   Chong of the new millennium with the Redman/Method Man pairing.  While most seem to agree that this is a horrible film, very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be.  When I use the word racist, I mean that it builds upon the degenerate clich\ufffds that African Americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society.  While there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring, what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing Method Man and Redman must be to both the film community, but also to their own culture.  I have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films, but this one left my jaw on the floor several times.  The blatant swings at African American stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director Jesse Dylan, but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face.  Humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clich\ufffds that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film.  Nothing was original.  Nothing was exciting.\u000a\u000aWas the pairing of Redman and Method Man an idea of comedic proportions?  I think not.  As you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film, the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers, but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought.  Why?  Method Man and Redman, who completely different people, were nothing more than the same character in this film.  With the very subtle hints of Method Man being smarter, nothing could separate the equality of these two characters.  That is why they failed as a comic team.  Think of Matthau and Lemmon or the above example of Cheech   Chong, what made these teams work while the How High team crashed and burned?  What worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together.  Their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together, but with Method Man and Redman, they were the same.  I was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film. What tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive.  What Dylan did to counter the similarity between Redman/Method Man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters.  The clich\ufffd jock, the clich\ufffd frat boy, the clich\ufffd Asian (which was again another racist moment), and the clich\ufffd rich white boy, just felt and were old.  Watch college films from the 70s and you will see these same combinations, but what makes the films from the 70s different is that they used them with originality.  How High, from beginning to end, was anything but original.\u000a\u000aI must admit, after watching this film of which Harvard was willing to loan their name to, I don't want to go to Harvard.  They should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage.  How High is a dark spot in Harvard's history.  Do you know what makes it even worse?  This film wasn't even created at or anywhere near Harvard.  Again, Dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film.  How High has no redeeming qualities.  Ooops, I stand corrected.  The only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when Spalding Gray spoke.  How did they get him and Fred Willard to do this film?  I have said it once, I will say it again, some actors just need their bills paid.  Inconsistency, incompetence, and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud.  What destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general, it is nothing.  There is no original story at all with How High.  Going to college, working for your grades, winning over the heart of the President right at the last minute - this was nothing short of a "cut and paste" film that had no backbone and horrid acting!\u000a\u000aI do not like Jesse Dylan's style of directing.  While I think Kicking and Screaming is his prized film (due greatly to Will Ferrell), all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes.  The John Adams scene in How High is a prime example.  The Benjamin Franklin moments is another.  The unconcluded "Truth Serum" can be considered another.  How High was just scene after scene of inconsistency.  Lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated!  I blame a majority of the issues with this film on Jesse Dylan.  If he would have tightened the script, created unique and "cult-like" characters, and eliminated the racism, he may have had the quintessential "weed" film in Hollywood.  Now, all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for.  Sad.\u000a\u000aOverall, this was one of the worst films that I have witnessed.  Never have I been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as I have with How High.  The actors, all around, were horrible.  The story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age, this film would never be considered a comedy.  Nothing was funny.  Nothing will make you laugh.  The only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits.  The ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life.\u000a\u000aGrade: * out of ****\u000a

aS"\tSUPER TEEN\n\tHaving been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth\n"

aS"\tweak\n\tThis movie was a weak effort by Capra, who directed it, and the star, Gary Cooper. It's a good story, just poorly directed (Capra can't hit a home run every time).

aS'\tRating the Product not the movie!!!\n\tThe movie is one of my favorites, works on both a romantic level, and a comic level.  But where\'s the widescreen?  Todays consumers are more educated (THANK GOD) and they\'ve almost stopped asking the stupid question "Why watch widescreen, you lose the top and bottom of the movie?!"  They finally get that you are seeing MORE of the movie with widescreen and not less.  So how can I be expected to buy this DvD?  It is for all intents and purposes "Incomplete".  Who\'s going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it?  Buy this movie as soon as WS version becomes availible\n'

aS'\tGarbage\n\tI cannot believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we\'ve seen in films like "baby boy". Almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word. He didn\'t add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance. I don\'t know what this film was about. There are parts where there is a long silence with no talking. The whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house.\nThere are a few scenes where the characters are running around  without any obvious aim. The film attempts to make the audience interested only to leave us saying, "what was all that excitement about?"\n'

aS"\tLacks real emotion and heart\n\tI expected alot more from Richard Harris. He was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of Abraham. Also, there wasn't enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible. I was somewhat annoyed that the movie had God saying that Sarai's name means Princess and that he would change it to Sarah which means Queen. This is not true!! In Hebrew Sarah means princess. Such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability\n"

aS"\tFOR BEGINNING BEGINNERS ONLY!!!\n\tWell, I guess I should've read more reviews of this DVD. It is STRICTLY for beginners.

But I'm sure it's good for a beginner--a BEGINNING BEGINNER. Sara Ivanhoe is soothing though, and encouraging. But seriously, this is a very easy workout\n"

aS"\tWhat's All the Fuss About?\n\tThe lead actor bore an uncanny resemblance to the real Edward R.

Maybe I've just seen too many biopics lately\n"

aS'\tGood film, worthless release\n\tFilm: 4.5 stars; DVD: 0 stars\n(DVD released March 2000)\n\nThis is a very good - albeit not great - film whose DVD release has been ruined by Disney, as they so often do:\n- 18(!) minutes deleted from the theatrically released version\n- non-anamorphic transfer\n  \nIt\'s been over six years since the DVD was released.  One can only hope that an un-butchered version is in the works.  However, based on Disney\'s track record, and on the quality of their marketing "wizards", I\'m not holding my breath.  Don\'t know if Disney licenses to Criterion but, if so, that may be the only way we get a decent DVD release\n'

aS'\tPaul Walker finally yields his throne to...\n\t... Tyrese Gibson, for WORST ACTOR EVER.  Up to this point, I\'ve been a huge Paul Walker fan for his comedically bad acting.  He\'s made a career of it.  In this one, his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word "bro" at least 75 times (to give his character street cred), and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops - it\'s clear Walker is deeply considering his plight.  But really Walker can\'t hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of Tyrese Gibson.  My god where did they find this guy?  The movie would\'ve been OK as a standard, mindless action film, but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting.\n\nNow you might be wonderning: who\'s the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie?  But wait, there\'s actually method to this madness.  Since their was no Vin Diesel, the director knew he had only Paul Walker left.  And it\'s well known that Walker cannot carry a film (see "Timeline").  So what to do?  Of course!  Find an actor EVEN WORSE than Walker and cast them together!  All of the sudden Walker doesn\'t look so terrible, because everyone\'s focusing on this other chump.  And apparently it worked, because a lot of people enjoyed this film, and there\'s even a sequel.\n'

Wild Things is sex sex sex but with witty capital H humor and a twisted story.\n\nRecent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film.

aS'\tUnconvincing\n\tColin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50\'s whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found "Truth" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible. Give this one a pass\n'

aS"\tA monotonous travelogue that might be of interest to those who've read his books\n\tPerhaps this video will satisfy the readers of Lincoln's various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books. \n\nHowever, it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln's books) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour.\n"

aS'\tExpanding your mind through books and bad German dubbing is a no-no\n\tViewing a movie as an adult that you once enjoyed as a kid is a good way to see if it stands the test of time. Many of those films that stand the test of time are from the Fantasy genre, including Labyrinth and Dark Crystal. Would I add Neverending Story to that list? Hell no. The dubbing is atrocious (funny Germans), and the costumes and "effects" are flat-out bad. Labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days, and easily trumped Neverending Story when it was released two years later. The story and plot had the potential to be interesting, but the execution makes Neverending fall flat. And sure, Neverending Story may have advocated reading in the mid-80\'s, but Labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics, which is the next step up for mind expansion\n'

aS'\tAlec Baldwin Could\'ve Been Hard-Boiled But Ends Up Soggy\n\tI remember going to great lengths to fit a matin e showing of HEAVEN\'S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release. Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke\'s New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke\'s characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they\'re hampered by two things: \n\n1.) The film\'s slo-o-o-ow pacing. Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone, not just Baldwin. Of all the actors, Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most, so much that it began to remind me of the sweating-bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE! \n\n2.) A plot that, as rendered in the film (whether it\'s the fault of the screenwriter or the editor, I can\'t be sure), never quite follows through on any of its elements. It\'s too bad, because these elements could\'ve made for an exciting movie: drug dealing, illegal alien smuggling, rival crime bosses (one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself, essentially playing a Southern-fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou\'s 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS), an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl (named "Alafair" by the Robichouxs, after Dave\'s mom. Late in my pregnancy at the time, I liked the name Alafair so much, I nearly changed my mind about naming my then-unborn daughter Siobhan!), and a bevy of beautiful, beguiling women, including earth mother Kelly Lynch, vampy Teri Hatcher in a full-frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time, and Mary Stuart Masterson, looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change-of-pace role for her: a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux. Despite the sexy promises in the movie\'s ads, none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces. Maybe the climate was already so hot, the filmmakers didn\'t want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration! As my mom put it at the time: "I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy, dashing Alec Baldwin, but he came up sweaty, rumpled, tired, depressed, and moving as if he was in slow motion. If he\'d made love as many times as he got beaten up, it would\'ve been the sexiest picture of \'96!" \n\nTo be fair, there *are* a number of strong characterization and action scenes, but there\'s just too darn much talky, molasses-paced lag time between them -- and yet, oddly, some of the scenes end abruptly just as they\'re about to become intriguing! Perhaps Joanou, Baldwin   Co. could\'ve dredged a tighter, more involving thriller out of this if they\'d whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so. As HEAVEN\'S PRISONERS is now...well, read James Lee Burke\'s books instead.\n'

aS'\tDevilishly addictive, but not much payoff\n\tThis program is evil. It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz, because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters, who have all died, find themselves in. They have gone to purgatory, and purgatory is like an all-too-real video game. One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries.\n\nThe art direction is decent. Visually, it doesn\'t look cheap. The English voice acting is embarassingly bad, especially the main character, but not as bad as the dialogue, internal and vocalized, that this character has been given to speak. \n\nThe worst thing about this series, apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners, is the "action" scenes. These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do, when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands, and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow. After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video, if you don\'t feel like banging your head against the wall, you are made of stronger stuff than I. \n\nThis first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers, and more frustration than satisfaction. Save yourself the pain.\n'

aS'\tWonderful series, Horrible Idea to re-release like this...\n\tLet me just start by saying that I don\'t own "The Chosen Collection" but that I do own the original releases of all seven seasons. \n\nWhy review this then? \n\nQuite frankly, I believe the combined sets to be a waste of money. I have seen the reviews of this set done by fellow reviewers, and it is was my experience that that the boxes for the previous sets are not much different than this - they are as flimsy as this set is, and just as breakable.\n\nThe set\'s discs appear the same as the previous editions, probably a rehash from leftover sets. A bonus disc may be the only redeeming factor, but since I don\'t own it, I haver never seen it.\n\nI spent my money on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" once, and once is enough for me.

aS'\tCandyman 3:  The Day of the Dead  (1999)\n\tDirector:  Turi Meyer\nCast:  Tony Todd, Donna D\'Errico, Alexia Robinson, Jsu Garcia, Mark Adair-Rios, Lupe Ontiveros, Elizabeth Guber, Rena Riffel, Ernie Hudson Jr.\nRunning Time:  93 minutes\nRated R for bloody violence and gore, sexuality and language.\n\nThe third in the series derived from a concept by Clive Barker, "Day of the Dead" (they can\'t even come up with their own subtitle) staggers down the well-trodden path already navigated by the "Halloween" and "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies: that is, taking a decent concept and flushing it down the toilet. The original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore, while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine. This one is just a load of rubbish.  Donna D\'Errico, from Baywatch (what a spectacle of credibility), stars as Caroline McKeever, the great great granddaughter of the feared Candyman (Tony Todd once again), once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror.  Caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest. As the Candyman hacks his way through various bad actors, Caroline teams up with new pal David (Nick Corri) to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the Candyman while he was still alive, which may hold the key to stopping him. \n\nThere\'s not a single thing here that isn\'t scavenged from the first "Candyman" film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days. The screenplay is so lazy it can\'t even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot, the photography is bright and glossy, which is at odds with what\'s supposed to be a dark story, while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all. Anyone could have directed this movie, so little effort has been put in to make it scary, while the ending is an outrageous cop out. No thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having D\'Errico running around in a variety of tight vests.  The rest of the performances are poor too, although none are quite as bad as D\'Errico\'s pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically.  Surely more can be done with characters like the Candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone\'s stomach.  The fact that the makers of this movie think Candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can\'t be bothered even to try something a bit different.  Clive Barker may not be the master of horror as every at first claimed him to be, but he\'s right about one thing: the sequels to his movies are garbage\n'

aS'\tOpt for Something Better\n\tI think Denise Austin does a decent job in some of her other videos, but this isn\'t one of them.  She lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she\'s just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot.  The moves are not well choreographed and very awkward.  Some may find encouragement in the times Denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says "We\'re burning butter.... yeah" but I found it annoying.  I think there are much better workouts for the money out there\n'

aS'\tWonderful film but poor DVD quality\n\tI bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of "Meet John Doe".

aS'\tA film that you already seen before\n\t"Killing Me Softly" has one of those scripts that just don\'t give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation, but the big "twist" at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable (unless perhaps you haven\'t seen a thriller before in your life). The chemistry between the two leads is also lacking; Fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned, he\'s an inexpressive bloke, while Heather Graham is ALL TOO expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera. Besides, she\'s not even that attractive; even her co-star in this particular film, Natascha McElhone, blows her out of the water in that department. The ending is like when you have a \'jawbreaker\' candy in your mouth, sweet and good in the beginning but when you get to the inside its bitter and sour. It was obvious towards the end of the movie that it would turn out like it did, I have seen quite a number of bad movies to figure it out so quickly\n\nIn spite of all that, Chen Kaige\'s direction is good, and he creates some suspenseful moments. So I give the film a generous "** out of 5" rating. But if you\'re a Heather Graham fan you will like this movie since she is nude in many scenes; and for Joseph Fiennes fans you\'ll receive half naked perks.\n'

aS'\t"Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.  The attorneys will provide the wisecracks."\n\tUpon its initial release, the attention that Otto Preminger\'s "Anatomy of a Murder" attracted due to its subject matter undoubtedly deflected some attention away from the fact that the film had its fair share of problems.  When watched today after much of its scandalous elements have lost their power to shock, its meandering story and uneven characterizations are exposed front and center. \n \nAttorney Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is asked to defend Lieutenant Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara) after a bar owner is found murdered.  Manion claims that he committed the murder in a fit of rage after his wife, Laura (Lee Remick), was raped.  While preparing his case for trial, Biegler finds that Laura is extremely difficult to work with because of her temperamental and flirtatious nature.  Nevertheless, the resourceful attorney continues to work on exonerating his client even though it is not clear whether he and his wife are being entirely truthful with him.\n \nStewart is his dependable self in "Anatomy of a Murder."  In fact, his performance as an attorney who is not afraid to stretch the rules is the one saving grace of the film.  There is little nuance in the performances of Gazzara and Remick and even the great George C. Scott misses the mark with an over-the-top effort.  Yet, the problems with the acting is secondary to the unfocused screenplay.  "Anatomy of a Murder" oftentimes seems more concerned with exploring the eccentric natures of its characters than in telling a good story.  The investigation of the crime is done in a half-hearted manner and the mystery behind the dual crimes of the rape and the murder are never resolved to any satisfaction.  For a film to run as long as "Anatomy of a Murder" does, one would think that there would be more than enough time to resolve all of the lingering questions posed by the film.  Yet, this is not the case\n'

aS'\tMisses the point\n\tWhile some critics can argue with Dan Brown\'s research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci "debunking" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this "Rock" of male dominancy was built the Church.\n\nThank you again, Dan Brown, by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been Jesus\' actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive Men\'s Club with Jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they contain\n'

aS"\tit doomed alright\n\tDuring my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically, the Rock.  He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.\n\nIt's not that Doom is really a bad movie.  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.  It's just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense, and that's it.  I'm sure the movie would've been big had it been released 10 years ago.  Todays generation is probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn't really designed to build to an awe-inspiring creative story.  \n\nDoom is the kind of movie you don't really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then forget about it the next morning.  Of course, I'm sure you don't forget to rewind the tape because that's impolite.  \n\nThe Rock never should have left wrestling.  It was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans (and the Rock means MILLIONS) really miss him.  Come back home, Rock.  Please\n"

aS'\tPretty Woman Meets Toxic Tort\n\tEven though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman."  I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich\'s story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena\'s wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).\n\nErin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere\'s character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie\'s beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney\'s (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller\'s medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG E (by and through the representation of Erin\'s boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.\n\nRoberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin\'s apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.\n\nAlbert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin\'s boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin\'s boyfriend-by-convenience.  The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin\'s benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers. \n\nThe plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly.\n'

aS'\tTruly Disappointing\n\tAfter I read Erik Larson\'s wonderful book "The Devil in the White City" I was fascinated by the brief glimpses at Holmes\' story. But this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment. The production is amateurish at best, complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of "Mondo Carne." With such a wealth of fascinating information available (court transcripts, etc) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened? This man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. Truly disappointing. Perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of Holmes. This most certainly isn\'t it\n'

They all cheered, of course, when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water, then becomes the chief.  The truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable, given the politically correct theme.  The truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture.  The truth is that tradition is not inherently evil.  The truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys.  Basically, if you hate men, this is the flick for you.  But it is not good.  It is not creative.  There are no surprises.  There is just nothing there.  As I edit this, it's no surprise to find so few people liked this review.  There are still plenty of hippies and politically correct so-and-so's out there\n"

aS'\tOld Action Heroes don\'t die, they just fade away.\n\tInstructions: rent Steven Seagall\'s latest action movie knuckle-fest "Exit Wounds". Insert in DVD player; watch first 15 minutes of movie, remove from DVD player. Return to video store. \n\n\nIf you follow those instructions to the letter, you\'ll have fun with "Exit Wounds", which features one of the best opening sequences of any action movie in recent memory (Seagall attempts to thwart a brash, brazen assassination attempt). \n\nThere\'s also a great scene---strike that, a Priceless Scene: hipster uber-villain (played convincingly by rapper DMX) and a henchman go on a shopping spree in an exotic car lot (ultimately settling on a Lamborghini Murcielago, paid for in cash out of a golf bag).\n\nThe scene is dope, def, and cool---it\'s all GOOD, Dawgz!----,in a New Jack City way. And that\'s a shame, really: it\'s so cool it just makes you grind your teeth as you begin, over the course of two hours, to realize that the rest of the movie just can\'t hold a candle to its opening minutes. \n\nAn action movie should be exciting; after Seagall foils a neatly organized assassination attempt on the U.S. Vice President (a brilliant little sequence which merits one star on its own, and from which 95% of the trailer material was taken), "Exit Wounds" is not exciting. \n\nIt\'s stale. It\'s rehashed. Honestly, were it not for DMX, the few riffs from the movie\'s excellent rap soundtrack, and the equipment, I would have thought I was watching an eighties Seagall flick. And that\'s surprising, given that the movie is helmed by "Romeo Must Die" director Andrzej Bartkowiak, who also did the cinematography for Speed, Lethal Weapon 4, and Devil\'s Advocate. \n\nThe plot, what there is of it, deals with police corruption, and features a major twist near the end that takes the punch out of the story and doesn\'t make any sense---but by that time you\'ve stopped caring. You\'ve seen all of this before---done better.\n\nWorst of all, Seagall is just too old to be a credible action hero; he\'s reached that wheezing, shortness of breath stage that afflicted Roger Moore back in "View to a Kill"---except Seagall doesn\'t have the acting chops that Moore was able to fall back on. Tom Arnold is thrown in for laughs, but the laughs are so feeble, and the jokes so stale, that you\'re laughing *at* Arnold and Seagall---not with them. \n\nMidway through "Exit Wounds" I was fighting to stay awake, and that\'s a shame, given that the first 15 minutes of the movie contained more sheer, hectic energy than any movie I\'ve seen since "Face/Off". \n\nRent the DVD for that opener if you dare, but if you stay any longer you\'ll see it\'s true: Old Action Heroes never die, they just fade away.\n\nJS\n'

This stinker convinced me Mr. Lynch owned shares in Kodak and wanted to sell film by the mile.  The only reason you may want to see this is so you will convince yourself never to see a David Lynch work ever again.  Do not buy it!!  Manos, The Hands of Fate is much more watchable than this.\nI get Brian Eno and ambient/atmosphere music is so you will use it as a background along with your imagination to create your own inner experience.  Film doesn't work that way (another reviewer compared this with Eno).  \nI find Memento a brilliant piece of work, really making me forget I am watching a film.  I think Videodrome is wonderful and compelling.  This - make sure you can watch something else.  Watch this in 100x speed.  You won't miss a thing.\nOkay, I just remembered, there is one movie worse than this one.  Reflections Of Evil.  If you actually like Eraserhead then get that movie too.

aS'\tCriterion now giving credit to Welles  poor (old)excuses\n\tThe Criterion Collection, a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films, is dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and award-winning, original supplements.The foundation of the collection is the work of such(real) MASTERS of cinema as Renoir, Godard, Kurosawa, Cocteau, Fellini, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Hitchcock, Fuller, Lean, Kubrick, Lang, Sturges, Dreyer, Eisenstein, Ozu, Sirk, Bunuel, Powell and Pressburger.\n\nThe Criterion Collection must feel embarrassed for wasting  a tremendous amount of time in this glorious package to glorify the most incompetent of all filmmakers. I did not watch any of the extras, but I hope you can find there those hilarious TV- clips from the 70s with Welles crying like a baby...."Oh...They only let me do the movie I wanted to make in Kane....\n'

aS"\tDon't waste your time purchasing this product.\n\tI didn't like this video for several reasons.  The rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands.  I was looking for an aerobic video.  I have Gilad - Bodies in Motion which is great but was getting bored with it since I had it for four years. Let me just say I'm sticking with Gilad because Denise does nothing for me.  You don't even feel like you had a workout with her.  She's boring.  I would recommend Gilad for aerobics and Tamilee Webb for toning.  Tamilee is awesome.

aS'\tChick Flick Hell\n\t*Warning: Spoiler*\nI cannot believe people, excuse me, some women are giving this movie four and five stars. \nInteresting premise,and it could have been a good, believeable movie-- but it was sooo syrupy. If this is what it\'s like to be in love, please somebody shoot me(note: I\'ve been in real love for 27 years now.) I got through the movie and probably would have given the movie a 3 and a half until the very end. Why the blankity-blank-blank does somebody always have to die at or near the end for the movie to be a "good movie"?\nI felt like I was drowning in estrogen by the time the movie was over. Wouldn\'t it have been more intriquing to leave the movie somehow pondering how this new love was going to all work out? That, at least, would have made the movie more intriquing, believeable and redeeming. If ever a movie was made to force tears, this is it. \nThis movie stinks and I don\'t mind telling you so--and it\'s not just because I\'m a man either. Imo, there\'s not much difference between this movie and a stupid, blatant Steven Segall movie where testosterone is promenaded around like it\'s the elixir of heaven. Same coin, different sides.\n  The movie should be given a "one"--no a "negative one" just for the stupid ending, but other redeeming factors make it a "two." Still not worth seeing--i.e., unless you\'re into infuriating yourself.\n\n**  Note: Even my wife and daughter--both chick-flick connousiours--hate this movie.I haven\'t checked yet, but I think my dogs do too.**\n\n  Another note: These two good actors needed a better movie. See Ryan in the superb "Courage Under Fire", or the Jim Morrison movie, or "When Harry Met Sally"--which I don\'t categorize as a "chick flick" but as a good romantic comedy,i.e., not contrived\n'

Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.\n"

aS'\tToo dumb to be funny\n\t"Legal Eagles" is supposed to be a comedy. We\'re supposed to find the characters played by Robert Redford and Debra Winger to be amusing, their acrimonious relationship to be hilarious, and the way that they end up being partners despite all of the gibes to be romantically satisfying.\n\nThe problem is that the movie is too dumb to be taken seriously, and thus too dumb to be funny.\n\nBriefly, the story takes place in New York. Robert Redford is an assistant District Attorney about to be promoted to be the DA. Debra Winger is a defense attorney, and Daryl Hannah is a young woman with emotional problems, and is Debra Winger\'s client. The plot involves a fire 20 years ago, when Daryl Hannah was eight, a fire that killed her artist father and purportedly destroyed a large number of his paintings. This experience left Daryl Hannah traumatized, but all is not as it seems, and now, 20 years later, Daryl Hannah is first accused of attempted theft and later of murder.\n\nUnfortunately, the plot involves many elements that simply don\'t make sense. I won\'t go into detail, but Roger Ebert does a good job of listing four different major things that make the plot completely unbelievable.\n\nAs well as the story being dumb I found some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny to be anything but. \n\nFor example, Robert Redford is a weekend father to a teenage daughter. At one point his ex-wife threatens to go to court to prevent him from seeing their daughter. Robert Redford makes a telephone call to his ex-wife\'s home and starts an angry monologue of threats about how he\'ll take her apart in court. Then he realizes that he\'s actually talking to his daughter! This mistake is apparently supposed to be hilarious. Ha, ha.\n\nIn another scene Robert Redford and Debra Winger are together and see one of the bad guys. Robert Redford takes off on foot to try to catch him. Debra Winger, who doesn\'t know how to drive a car, feels it necessary for her to jump into Robert Redford\'s car and try to follow him. She makes a wrong turn and finds herself going the wrong way into traffic on a wide heavily trafficked street. There follows one minute of her frantically dodging cars at the last moment. Very funny. Ha, ha, ha.\n\nThis movie could have been a fairly good romantic thriller if they had fixed the plot and not tried to be a comedy. But the dumb plot and the unfunny attempts at comedy make it a complete waste of time.\n\nRennie Peterse\n'

aS"\tUnnecessarily Epic...\n\tAfter 40 minutes of objective viewing, and shot after superfluous shot, I sat through another 30 minutes in pain. I've come to the fairly well informed conclusion that either Peter Jackson can ONLY do epics wheather it calls for it or not, or LOTR in all it's incarnations had immense levels of supervision for Jacksons from higher-ups. Kong is not an epic, it is a tragedy. Tell me to watch the whole thing, if you will, but if the film is constructed so poorly 70 minutes in, I don't need to. On another note. Jurassic park had better CGI than this. Mr. jackson, no more 'epic fly-by shots please.\n"

aS'\tEuuuwww......Creepy!\n\tThis movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it\'s the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton\'s other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you\'re an adult and pales compared to the original. If you\'re a kid it\'s way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It\'s really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It\'s amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don\'t waste your time with this steaming pile of poo!\n'

aS'\tPerfectly decent, perfectly inoffensive, and perfectly dull\n\tJoel Hershman\'s "Greenfingers", starring the now-famous (and utterly gorgeous) Clive Owen and Helen Mirren, is a sweet, cutesy, and utterly empty British romantic comedy.  In this forgettable, generic chick-flick, inmates at a British minimum-security prison take up gardening.  Initially, they are understandably reluctant to garden.  But, get this, gardening ends up changing their lives!  And, after his parole, Owen\'s character even commits another crime just so he can go back to prison and garden!  And Mirren\'s character is so impressed with the innmates\' gardening that she even has them garden for her!  Wow, where do people get this stuff?\n\nOf course, this being a "romantic comedy" and all, there is a romance between Owen and Mirren\'s daughter that is so incredibly forced, awkward, and contrived that one cannot help but cringe as the two actors attempt to gaze lustfully at each other.  In addition, peppered throughout are moments of in-your-face sentimentality and supposed "uplifting moments".  And none of it works.\n\nFor all its good intentions, "Greenfingers" is as drab and colorless as the cinderblock walls of the inmates\' rooms. It\'s all perfectly decent, perfectly inoffensive, and perfectly dull\n'

aS"\tnot a pleasant christmas story\n\tSomeone bought this 3D DVD for my almost 5 year old daughter.  We thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were.  However,  within minutes of the movie's beginning my daughter was in tears. I won't say why but she found the plot frightening.  Several times during the movie I tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end.  Fortunately the movie is relatively short.  Overall, I found the story to be a cynical look at Christmas.  As an adult, I think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of Christmas shopping but I urge caution before showing it to young children.  There was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of Christmas\n"

aS'\tAmazing movie, terrible "remastering"\n\tThis is a review of the "Ultimate Collector\'s Edition," NOT a review of the film itself. If you\'re considering the purchase of a two-disc special edition, you probably already know that the film is great; you just want to know if this slick package is worth the pricetag. \n\nIn short, it\'s not. And let me be absolutely clear about one thing: I have known and loved this film for years. A few sequences look properly spectacular, but after watching this DVD on two separate (and high-quality) televisions, I\'m amazed that all of the low-light scenes have been rendered almost completely dark. Like, too dark to tell what\'s even *happening*. For instance, the scene where Brad (Harry Carey, Jr.) runs off to his death, the scene where Marty\'s (Jeffrey Hunter\'s) "bride" is serving coffee along the river, and even the pre-dawn scenes leading up to the final storming of the Comanche camp, are utterly lost in the dark. By contrast, the bare-bones 1997 DVD release features noticeably richer colors in the daytime scenes and total clarity in the low-light scenes I\'ve just mentioned. Don\'t waste your money on this special edition; you\'ll be much happier if you just shell out the $10.99 for the 1997 release.\n'

aS'\tMeledramatic and poor\n\tAs much as I like Paul Newman, this movie is very disappointing once you\'ve seen the far-superior film "Day One".  The portrayal of Oppenheimer and Groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people.  The movie dwells on romantic side stories instead of fleshing out the history and science of the Manhatten project.\n\nBe sure to see "Day One" if you are interested in this, and give this film a miss\n'

aS"\tReally bad...\n\tDon't waste your time. I usually give low budget horror a chance and I have an open mind, but this movie is utterly ridiculous.\n"

aS"\tThe legend reworked...\n\tTo be fair, the legends of Herakles, as they were originally written, have little to do with this movie, but maybe that's for the best.  Having grown up on Superman, Batman and the Justice League, I have a hard time calling a person like Herakles a hero.  In the original legends, he was a warrior, but also a brute who eventually wound up killing his wife and children in a fit of rage.  He also wasn't, as far as I can tell, as strong as in this version.\nTherefore, interpretations of Herakles are, I think, to be judged not on whether or not they deviate from the legend, but on where and why.\nDisney has attempted to take Herakles (or Hercules, in the Roman) and make it a story about a true hero, and a perfect one at that.  There's nothing I like more than perfect heroes.  They inspire me.  Conceptually, I like the idea.\nInstead of Herakles being the illegitimate son of Zeus and a mortal woman, he's conceived in love by Zeus and Hera and turned mortal by a potion.  Not bad.  As changes go, it works better than most.\nHerc meets Meg at the beginning of his hero carreer and falls instantly in love with her and she with him (another deviation from the legend, and a very good improvement.)  Of course, because Hera is his mother in this version, she can't be Herc's enemy, so they make his opponent Hades; lord of the dead, which could be worse, as changes go.  I've never seen Hades as being all that bad of a guy, but that's how it goes.  Then there's the Hydra, which is, if anything, much larger and more powerful than it was originally, so that's good too.  Aside from this, however, I have to say I was disappointed with most of the changes.\nThe titans, to start with, were underplayed considerably.  It might have been premature to mention that they were Zeus' predecessors, but they could at least have given them powers similar to what they actually had, and a roughly-similar appearance.  Oceanus, for example, lashing out with blasts of water from his hands like a fire hose, or Cronos reversing the movements of his olympian enemies would have made for an excellent action sequence, particularly since Hercules didn't beat the titans alone in the original stories, nor does it make sense that he should in this one (grabbing a whirlwind?  Come ON now.)\nI actually didn't mind Hades' used-car-salesman demeanor all that much, though I didn't see a reason why he should have flame-based powers when that's clearly Apollo's territory.  Further, I thought most of the Gods and Muses were given no credit at all in terms of their innately glorious nature.\nWhy is this the case?  I think Disney made the mistake, in this film, of not just trying to make the legends clean, but FUN as well, and there's nothing fun about war.  I'm not saying they couldn't have made the concept work.  In fact, I'm saying they could have made it work if they'd toned down the comedy and given the characters a bit of respect (Justice League style.)\nStill, for what it's worth, this is one of the few movies left in the world that isn't afraid to dwell on the concept of a hero, and for that it's worth at least one viewing.  Rent it from your local video store, in my opinion, before you make your decision\n"

aS"\tNot What I Was Expecting\n\tLadder 49 was not the type of film I expected-- I was hoping for a good, fast-paced action flick, which I got for about the first 5 minutes. The remainder of the 30 minutes that I watched was flashback to the rookie firefighter's first days at the station. \n\nSomeone looking for drama and a story about the growth of a firefighter would probably like this movie. However, those looking for action should probably look elsewhere\n"

aS'\tHorrible\n\tAbsolutely unwatchable. Cliche-ridden. So silly it\'s very nearly offensive. It\'s like watching one long music video by a B-level rapper - full of dumb, beautiful women, buff, monkey-headed ghetto thugs, and jokey tricked-out cars. Without a doubt one of the worst movies I\'ve ever seen. The script is laughable, the acting worse. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are more "Dumb and Dumber" than "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid". Awful\n'

aS"\tmaybe it just hasn't aged well...\n\tok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.\n\nI mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.\n\nbut that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.\n\ntake the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better.\n\nso while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one\n"

aS'\tWhat the.....\n\tHonestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I\'m surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it. \n\nThe stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there\'s a V.I.P suspect with a "history" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he\'s involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it\'s not him. And Calleigh gets "evidence" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I\'ve seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge "clues" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that\'s unlikely? Exactly my point.\n\nIn short, I wouldn\'t move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else. Watch this show if you\'re REALLY bored, with nothing else to do and no better use of your time. If you want real Crime Scene Investigation, watch the original C.S.I, Las Vegas. That\'s the best C.S.I....period\n'

aS'\tStick with Willy Wonka\n\tI could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern\'s classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp\'s "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton\'s film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton\'s part, that doesn\'t make the final product any more watchable. It\'s one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton\'s other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that\'s like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$\n'

aS'\tScewed and Slanted\n\tThey spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can\'t distinguish one\'s ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they\'re talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let\'s not talk about that - let\'s just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don\'t! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don\'t even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don\'t they address this?  This "docu" is more slanted than "Fahrenheitt 911" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking.\n'

aS'\t"Family Values" dreck\n\tCinema-wise, you know you\'re witnessing the beginning of the end when the best Hollywood can come up with is a SEQUEL to a REMAKE (it`s not often that two crimes of unoriginality are committed in a single film).  But that is exactly what "Cheaper by the Dozen 2" turns out to be - and the result, quality-wise, is pretty much what one would expect.\n\nThis is one of those alleged family comedies in which the adults (the male adults at any rate) are infinitely more immature in their attitude and behavior than the children they are raising.  Steve Martin returns as the prolific father of twelve who is beginning to sense that his children, as they are growing older, no longer want to spend quality time together as a family.  To rectify the situation, he takes them all on a vacation to a favorite lake resort - a move that threatens to turn into a full-scale disaster when the Bakers find themselves embroiled in a fierce competition with a neighboring family of snooty overachievers led by Eugene Levy, a patriarch who runs his brood with so much spit-and-polish regimentation that he makes Captain Von Trapp look like a touchy-feely pushover in comparison.\n\nOne might be tempted to call this a distended version of a "Brady Bunch" episode and leave it at that, but even that show, for all its lack of sophistication, didn\'t portray the father as a total and irredeemable doofus with serious developmental issues and the emotional maturity of a bratty six-year-old.    Besides the daddy-is-a-dope stereotype, all "Cheaper by the Dozen 2" has to offer is lame slapstick, a silly pre-pubescent "Romeo and Juliet" subplot, and push-button scenes of emotional uplift in which a crescendo of swelling violins serves as the cue for the tears to start flowing.  The drearily unoriginal screenplay comes replete with the requisite dog-humping incidents and poop jokes, and not one but TWO scenes of an elderly handicapped gentleman rolling off into the lake in a wheelchair.   \n\nAny more of these films and Planned Parenthood won\'t have to mount a fundraising drive for years to come\n'

aV	Poor man's truth serum: caffeine and sugar.\u000a	There is a pattern in Hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as Eye for an Eye.  It is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised.  They are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end, whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end.  It is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort, but for this critic it is getting old.  Eye for an Eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film.  From the opening credits of this film, you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end.  The pauses could be guessed, the lines could have been written the night before, and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best.  It was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic, the violins would always shrill around Kiefer, and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere.  This is your typical revenge film with no excitement, no frills, nothing that would make it stand out from the rest.  The late director John Schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films, which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end.\u000a\u000aWhere did Eye for an Eye go wrong?  I don't think I need to count all the ways for you, but some of the bigger issues that I had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters.  I have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic.  What was Sally Field's job?  I know that is a small detail, but it better highlights my complaint that our central family (the McCanns) were not as developed as I would have liked to have seen.  I had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death, yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed.  Ed Harris literally walked through his character, proving that Field's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion.  The only character worth watching, and was developed briefly, was Kiefer.  He was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end.  Yet, we didn't even know that much about him either (which upset me).  Schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with Eye for an Eye very well, the actors I believe even knew the story and they probably didn't even need to read the script, and the story played it safe from the beginning, but it wasn't what I wanted to see.  I expected film like this to come out during the 80s, not in 1996.  It was pathetic to see name actors like Ed Harris, Sally Field, Phillip Baker Hall, Keith David, and Kiefer Sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan.  Nothing stood out in this film, nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it, and nothing made me feel excited about these actors.  This was a literal "nothing" film.  It lent nothing to the cinematic world except (and I stress this a bit) another peg in a very tired genre known as the "Revenge Thriller".\u000a\u000aAfter watching this film I said to my wife that I thought Sally Field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it, overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements, which made me think of a High School drama production.  It was amateur at best, but she said that is why directors use Sally, because she is known for being overly dramatic.  This is a pure example of a good thing gone badly.  Sally saw success with it once, but as she continues it only creates bad cinema.  There were times during Sally's bigger speeches that I found myself laughing.  I couldn't help myself, but her focus on certain words and clich\ufffd reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike.  The same could be said for Ed Harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn't have to play the outlaying father any further in films.  He was completely wasted in this film.  Was there any emotion with him?  I didn't see any.  Then there was the pitiful contribution by Hall and David that begin with intrigue, but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes.  Also, did Mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clich\ufffd?  Urg, his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers.  Again, the only actor worth watching was Kiefer because he not only spoke with evil, but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile.  It was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end.  \u000a\u000aIf I have to talk about the story I think I am just going to go mad myself.  Field over dramatized the entire film, thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer.  Did Kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because Field wanted to see him as evil?  That could have been a great avenue for this film to travel, but alas, ole safe Schlesinger didn't take us down that darker path.  I needed more to develop what Hall and David were doing at the support groups, but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers.  This was yet another dark avenue that was not explored.  I felt as if I saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast, yet we chose to stay on the lighted path.  That, coupled with the poor acting, just created a film that didn't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world.\u000a\u000aOverall, in case it wasn't obvious, this wasn't a good movie at all.  In fact, I could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again.  I thought only horror movies had the stated Scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again, but with Eye for an Eye it became obvious that it the "Revenge Thrill" fell into that same pattern.  The only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure, this film did not.  Sally Field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight, while everyone else was forgettable.  The only fun part was watching Jack Bauer play the epitome of evil.  Watch this film for Kiefer, but nothing else.  Skip it!\u000a\u000aGrade: * out of ****\u000a

aS'\tOnly for Kiefer\n\tThis is a surprisingly poor movie. Although it has some well-known actors, and a notable director, the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night TV-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up.\n\nThe movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings (though legitimate in many cases). It also glosses over the grieving process of the family, ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child, overdoes Kiefer Sutherland\'s character flaws (which are considerable nevertheless), and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title.\n\nIn one particularly-bad scene, after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically, Sally\'s character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at Keifer\'s character when they meet on the street and he talks to her.\n\nI don\'t know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much. I only see wide-spread mediocrity.\n\nI would only recommend this for fans of Keifer. "Ssssssorry", Sally, not your best role or movie. Ditto Ed Harris, whose other movies I generally like.\n'

aS"\tLike to waste your time? Then you'll love this one.\n\tI saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him (he was seeing it for a second time.) After the first ten minutes, I wanted to leave. If you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb American youth from small, hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local Wal-Mart or becoming mince-meat in Iraq, then this movie is for you!  However, if you like movies that actually challenge you to think, don't waste your time with this one\n"

aS'\tgobbledygook   self-righteousness   pretentious twaddle make for a terrible movie\n\tthere is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable "crash", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst "mainstream" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek\n'

aS'\tDreadful and  Insulting\n\tLike other reviewers, I found MeetThe Parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for $25 bin at Hollywood so I figured "Why not?"\nWell here\'s why not. It presents the main character\'s parents as crude, clueless buffoons, and having no social judgement whatsoever, but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip. And for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on Fantasy Island. I\'m surprised they didn\'t include a sex with a midget scene. Nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former CIA agent, who was set up as an object of ridicule. Oh, and they had to be Jewish too. Streisand and Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way. {"Our people don\'t shoot ducks, dear")\nDo former CIA agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built RV that would cost at least $250 k? The toilet humor and profanity wouldn\'t have made it into "Dumb and Dumber"\nNothing reedeming or funny here. Fuhgeddaboutit\n'
p131
aS'\tRear-View Mirror Propaganda Piece\n\tI\'ll cut to the meta-chase since plot and story have already been well outlined in previous reviews...\n\nThe basic message of this film seems to be that state controlled "education" is worthy of resurrection and total dictatorship is the way to achieve it. Though the latter point is probably true, the former is questionable indeed. Why try and save an obviously moribund and mindless system of government indoctrination from its own demise? Don\'t blame the kids, you have only to look at the state of the world to see the utter failure that so-called educated people have already created everywhere, with world fascism now its ultimate fruitage, and the kids at some level know it...Clearly we urgently need a new vision of education altogether, but this film only asks us to glorify what has already died...\n'

Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats. \n\nThe movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional. \n\nThis film Awful.\n"

aS'\tOverrated, juvenile writing\n\tThis series might be considered a classic if watched by a 12-year-old, but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters. Most of the plot\'s famous "unpleasantness" is just tacked on to the main story, and is of no significance.\n\nApart from putting several of the characters though lots of physical abuses, nothing much gets accomplished thought the series. The main female character clocks about 100 words of dialog across the entire series, so don\'t bother waiting for any meaningful information from her. The male lead has the typical task of pointing out all the flaws in the alternate world he\'s been transported to, inbetween having the stuffing beaten out of him.\n\nThe most arbitrary abuses are handed out to a young woman, who\'s included in the story for no reason except to be abused- you can almost hear the writers saying, "I got it! Let\'s rape a little girl, that\'ll make it REAL! Yeah, Yeah, I like it!" Having served her purpose, the character then vanishes until being plopped back in near the end of the series, so a little more misery can be dumped on her.\n\nAll the characters suffer from lack of depth and motivation. The releative standout would be the villian, who suffers from bipolarism, and alternates between terror, anger, delight, and misery, somtimes all within the same scene. Too bad that was about all he did in the show.\n\nWell, that\'s about enough. If you have an appetite for "Kid saves alternate universe" themed anime, then you may like this. But I found it lifeless and massively overrated\n'
p136
aS'\tplot holes\n\tThe first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don\'t know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don\'t know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn\'t, so that\'s why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we\'re not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn\'t turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat "hero" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that\'s true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, \'dreamboat\' takes the turn as lead character, and it\'s his story we\'re following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it\'s her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out \'dreamboat\' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don\'t have the same truth in mind - it\'s about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it\'s not the comic book variety, isn\'t fun for an audience, it\'s just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that\'s the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed\n'

aS"\tMediocre sequel to a excellent original\n\tThis tepid,disappointing sequel is far better than Beyond the Re-Animator but dosen't equal a good sequel to the excellent original. Dr.Herbert West and his friend Dan re-animate dead bodies and when Dan's girlfriend is dying she is re-animated just like Bride of Frankenstein. The gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along. The new director Brian Yuzna does a good job taking over Stuart Gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a Sci/Fi channel movie that would debut on TV and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast(Except Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbott),lower production values and lower budget,and tepid to atrocious acting. If you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of Beyond the Re-Animator.\n"

aS'\tfun, but absolutely pointless...\n\tI was a fan of House(the first of the series) and so purchased the combo DVD set of House and House 2.  I watched both movies with a friend recently and we decided that while House is pretty good, House 2 is definitely the kind of movie you waste an hour and a half on.  It is really quite dumb, but some of the creatures(i.e. "catter-dog" as I like to call him) are kind of fun to see.  I would suggest skipping the second House unless you just want to watch a movie to see how dumb a sequel can really be;-\n'

aS"\tHow do you make incest *dull*?\n\tFor a topic this edgy, this is an incredibly dull film. The actors are good enough, mind you. But they can only do so much, because the real problem with this film is the script. For the first twenty minutes or so of screen time, the viewer is led through a series of confusing and rather disconnected scenes involving the perpetually discontented Natalie and the nice young man who turns out to be her younger brother. (You *might* not pick up on that fact at first, since there are minimal references to it in the first third of the film--certainly the two *look* nothing alike.) Finally the main part of the plot begins, with Natalie just as discontented, despite being married to a wealthy and quirky-but-ultimately-nice guy (Alan Rickman, for whose sake I watched this film at all--not worth it), and with her brother seemingly happy with his life, but somehow still willing to be drawn into a sexual relationship with his sister. From that point, things spiral--no, that's too dynamic a word to describe it--*mosey* out of control, with the fickle sister trying to break off the affair, the poor brother (the only particularly sympathetic character in the film) becoming obsessed with the relationship, and the worried hubby's suspicions growing (although not in the right direction). There's so much here that *could* have been fascinating and compelling, but isn't, on any level. The plot just wanders aimlessly through an only semi-believable situation, scattering out the occasional pebble of human misery with its slogging feet. This video seems to have disappeared from most rental shops--mercifully for the public--but I certainly wouldn't recommend resorting to buying it.\n"

aS"\tOk film.. Less than OK DVD..\n\tFirst off, I am a HUGE Pixar fan. In November in '95 I took my company to see Toy Story and within 6 months of that showing I got rid of most of the employees that didn't like the film. I've seen every Pixar film at least 5o times. Nuff said.\n\nAnyway, I liked the film Cars.. but not as much as other Pixar flicks.. Its still good..\n\nHowever, the DVD is underwhelming: a) no commentary b) horrible deleted scenes c) not much in extras. The Route 66 mini-documentary is ok though..\n\nThis DVD is about as bad as the first release of A Bug's Life.. another skimpy release on DVD..\n\nFinally, they didn't include a tribute to Joe Ranft..

aS"\tBuy only the first set...\n\tThe first set was very entertaining--a spy/crime caper spoof with dashes of comic brilliance provided by Moore and Curtis--Set II is another kettle of fish altogether.  The second set is strictly played for laughs--there is little or no character development and the plots and dialogue run rather thin.  Frankly, I hoped for more. \n\nFor those who wish to obtain a true collector's set of this highly entertaining series, would do better to purchase the Network DVD Megaset Special Edition of The Persuaders, now available thru AmazonUK with some delighful extras including bumpers, promotional materials, episode commentaries, tv spot interviews, title sequences, and hour-long interviews with director, Robert Baker, Tony Curtis, and Roger Moore.  Tony Curtis' unabashed comments regarding the production team,  guest-star Joan Collins's antics on the set, and his marijuana bust en route to London for the taping of the first episode, are absolutely priceless in this Network DVD set.  \n\nSurprisingly, the acute observer will notice that some of the episodes in the second box of the A E set are written by none other than Terry Nation--who would go on to pen a bigger and more serious series SURVIVORS in the UK four years later-when will that be available in the US?\n"

aS"\tA Great film,BEWARE OF PUBLIC DOMAIN VERSIONS!\n\tquot;Metropolis quot;,Fritz Lang's 1927 silent masterpiece,is one of the most important films ever made and also a great one! But over the years,this film has been reedited,recut,and shortened which ruins the exact vision of an extrordinary filmmaker.Since its stay on the Public Domain shelf,the prints and image quality have over the years been poor.I DO NOT recommend the following versions:1.the Goodtimes Video release has poor image quality and even worse,NO MUSICAL SCORE! 2.The now-notorious Madacy DVD, which is about 5 times as worse as the Goodtimes video release,contains horrible,blurry image quality,freeze-frame opening titles,and an annoying musical score! Just recently,TCM (Turner Classic Movies) has broadcast the brand-new,beautifully restored 2002 restoration of  quot;Metropolis quot; which I taped off of and trust me,it's well worth it! Buy the Kino restored version on either VHS or DVD,but DO NOT buy the horrible Public Domain versions which can definitely rip you off!

I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.  Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I\'ll never get that time back.

I understand that the budget might have been too small to invite one of those dj's mentioned above for an interview or so ...but in this movie there are lots of dj's that are not that well representative of an industry that's becomming smaller and smaller.

aS'\tLow Quality Sword and Sandal Movie\n\tDelmer Daves\' mediocre direction of the sequel to the equally pathetic film "The Robe" starring Richard Burton.  A totally contrived film that demonstrates no competence in either screenplay, direction, acting, or historical accuracy of any sort.  Avoid at all costs unless you\'re expecting to see it as a comedy.\n\nCompared to Kubrik\'s incredible direction for \'Spartacus\' a few years later, the gladiatorial scenes in this film are second rate. Even the low budget film \'Barabas\' with Anthony Quinn had better direction than this worthless film.  The screenplay is contrived, the script is worthless, and the acting utterly shallow from everyone on this film: at least \'The Robe\' had Richard Burton.  Victor Mature continues to act as if he just came out of a cocktail lounge after a few martinis too many.  Jay Robinson continues his idiotic and ridiculous performance of Caligula as if the character were a retarded bufoon instead of the diabolical genius of cruelty and perversion (See Hurt\'s performance in the BBC\'s \'I, Claudius\' to see how a good actor handles this character.)  In short, reading the New Testament or going to a church sermon is far more entertaining and historically faithful than watching this garbage film.  Just the fact that Victor \'Manure\' is in this film says it all.\n\nIgnore this pathetic film and watch \'Spartacus\', \'Barabas\', or even the fantasized \'Gladiator\' for some good Gladiatorial films.  As for Biblical films, \'Ben Hur\', \'The Ten Commandments\' or \'Quo Vadis\' are films that are worth watching much more than this putrid Hollywood junk.\n'

He made it sound like the most graphic and disturbing prison movie ever. You would have thought it compared to the \'Ilsa\' movies the way this guy went on about it. I\'m not sure what movie he saw, but it wasn\'t this one. When the most extreme scene in the movie involves a person being shot at falling over bloodlessly like an old western, you have to wonder why exactly it merited an "unrated" version.\nI guess it\'s worth it if you want to see naked women dancing around in a circle, but it you want to see a gritty violent movie, buy something else\n'

Then mysterious bugs that disintegrate in bright light start infesting them one by one, turning them into murderous zombies. So far, so eccentric, and the satire is sometimes very funny. The FX are so bargain-basement, however, and the plotting so loose, that the film loses direction and winds uup just going through the motions in the last half-hour after a rather promising set-up. Zach Galligan must have been really hungry for work when he chose to do this movie.\n\nThe menu is basic, and the only extras are trailers for Infested, Anaconda, and the Creature Features series.\n\nI like the wit.

aS'\tno title\n\tExcept for the presence of Kevin Bacon, whom I like a lot, this would have been a real loser.  There were so many things wrong.  Directed by Paul Glaser with no surprises, no depth of character, a too heavy-handed Hollywood scenario.  You knew what was coming a mile away.  There was good cinematography and music, and Kevin Bacon is always appealing, but that\'s the best I can say.  Oh, and the nun.  She was pretty good too.  The lead black man was also engaging; the problem was really the script.  Too pat, and too many unbelievable things that screamed "Hollywood".  Like when the village burned down.  They were ready to just up and leave where they\'d lived for generations.  As if it takes generations to rebuild their houses.  And there were no signs of the burned buildings during the basketball game.  And Bacon was supposed to climb this incredible mountain, get cut in the groin, then play basketball, all on a rotten knee.  Please\n'

aS'\ttobe hooper\'s HUGE MISFIRE after "chainsaw" and "salam\'s lot"\n\twhen given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director.to bad this one isn\'t a very good story.\n    this mess came out at the heigth of the "slasher" movie frenzy. but not wanting to be just a slasher movie they try to give us a monster also. the theme of 4 kids who,now hold on here,think it would be fun to spend the night in the funhouse at a traveling carnival. before you can say "please kill me" the "thing" is picking them off one by one. with only 4 teens in the funhouse you would think maybe some fleshing out of the teens would happen, but no, they just go for the tease scares and even at 90 mins. this bore last to long\n'

aS"\tHow to make a good story boring\n\tWatching this movie, I am struck by how effectively they can take one of the most interesting and exciting stories possible, and make it drag out on the screen.  The disappointment at the pacing of such great subject matter holds no bounds.  Watching this moving is almost embarassing knowing how good this could and should be, and how poor direction, and what seems like a script which does injustice to pacing and drama can wreck what should be greatness.  I won't even go into historical inaccuracies, or the completely ridiculous cover art showing a modern beretta as the pistol sidearm 40 years too early.  Makes me wonder if this movie was crafted with apathy towards the subject, the audience and history instead of respect\n"

aS'\tGold medal winner in the "Most Annoying Character In A Fictional Screenplay" category\n\tSome juvenile delinquent girl gets in trouble with the cops, she\'s sent to gymnastics camp (she used to be a sickeningly famous gymnast before she became a worthless slacker).  She thinks everything and everyone is really really stupid, she does nothing but argue with everyone all the time, it\'s all her parents fault of course because she\'s perfect, her dialogue consists of nothing but smart-aleck remarks that she says in that "oh so cute" way that fans of Lizzie McGuire may find clever...good grief.  This is just beyond unwatchable.  Even worse is the fact that the lead actress is 24 years old, and yet her and everyone else in the whole movie act like a bunch of narcissistic 12 year olds;  It just grates on your nerves until you\'re about ready to shove the DVD through the paper shredder.\n'

It was done while he was alive, and has him "painting" little cartoon-like "works" that were done only for this DVD...one...after...the....other ad nauseum.  This is Picasso as celebrity entertainer cartoonist, not the edgy artist genius of Les Demoiselles d\'Avignon and Guernica.  It looks as if he\'s painting with magic markers on screen and the action is speeded up so it looks like a cartoonist at work.  I turned it off after 30+ interminable minutes.  Fortunately I rented it on Netflix, which I\'d recommend, rather than buying it\n'

aS'\tThis Film is an Outrageous Sacrilege!!!!!!!\n\tMany people will consider giving this movie such a low rating a sacrilege.This is understandable because so many people have grown up watching this film.I too loved this movie at a certain period of my life.The period between my birth and when I turned ten.That was when I read the book.The book is perhaps one of the greatest literary works ever created.It has now been awhile since I first read it,but I still remember the excitement I felt with each new chapter.I finished it in a few short hours.Since then,I have reread it several times,and each time it has been just as enjoyable.It is a true classic that people of all ages can enjoy.My brother reads as little as possible, but even he loved it.The movie,on the other hand,has gotten worse with each subsequent viewing.It deters from the book in almost every way possible.It makes a mockery of each character through a combination of poor writing and horrible acting.Judy Garland is an absolutely abominable choice to play the plucky heroine,Dorothy Gale.In the book,Dorothy was a little girl of about eight or nine and she was brave and clever.In the film,she is whiny,cowardly,fretful,and slightly stupid.She is also portrayed as being around fifteen.Making her this old distorts the book and her older age doesn\'t fit with her childish behaviour and appearance.Besides wrecking the book,this movie when looked at clearly is a terrible film.Don\'t misunderstand me,I am a fan of musicals.However,this film made for an atrocious musical.Practically every single song was ANNOYING!!!!!Also,the "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" number did not suit the plotline as it was in the book.This brings me to the BIGGEST,MOST AWFUL,distortion of them ALL!!!In the book,Dorothy really went to OZ!!!!!Not only that,she returned to Oz several times in other OZ books.Eventually,she even moved there to live!!!In making the whole experience a dream,the entire story of OZ was destroyed.Having said that,this movie receives a 1 in my opinion.Even so,I realize that many people will persist in liking this movie despite my words of wisdom.If they do sill consider this movie a favorite after reading the book,then the 3-Disc DVD is the edition to purchase.The features look good and the picture is restored.As for me,I will spend my money on better things.\n'

aS"\tWow-- it's impressive how much of a mess this is.\n\tThe Weight of Water (Kathryn Bigelow, 2000)\n\nThis movie should have been a big production-- an adaptation of an Anita Shreve novel directed by Near Dark's Kathryn Bigelow, starring a handful of big-name actors. So why does it seem like a Lifetime Original Movie(TM) on steroids?\n\nJean Janes (Shadow of the Vampire's Catherine McCormack) is obsessed with a pair of murders that occurred on the Isles of Shoals in 1873, when Louis Wagner (Rome's Ciaran Hinds) was convicted of the murders of two women and executed. Jean isn't sure they got the right person. She and her poet husband Thomas (Sean Penn) set off for the islands on a boat with Thomas' brother Rich (Josh Lucas, recently of Poseidon) and Rich's new girlfriend Adaline (Elizabeth Hurley, who went from this right on to film Bedazzled). The interpersonal relationships on the boat cause tensions to flare, as everyone seems to want pretty much everyone else, and the situation on the boat brings Jean to a possible revelation of an alternative theory of the crime.\n\nIt's an interesting premise, and from everything I've heard it's carried off quite successfully in the book, which I haven't read. But oh, it doesn't work well at all in the film. The links between the two stories are shown only by the way the two stories are intercut; no work at all was done on trying to parallel the two in any structural way. Most of the actors are wasted here; even the vastly talented McCormack seems only a shadow of her usual irrepressible self, while Sarah Polley, whose story takes place over in the nineteenth century time frame, seems as if she's worn down by a lot more than inimical primitive island life. About the only actor who's really effective here is Hinds, who plays his role to the hilt.\n\nIt's not the worst movie I've seen in the past month, but it's pretty close. *\n"

aS"\tFantastical let down\n\tUnlike many, I hadn't seen this film when it first came out.  So it was with much anticipation that I recently sat down to watch it.  Well, it stunk.  What a disappointment.  The only really good thing in there is Leo McKern, who shines forth like a beacon in a fog of wooden acting and stilted dialogue.  Show 'em how it's done, Leo.  \n\nMichelle Pfeiffer is beautiful to look at, but her role is limited.  Matthew Broderick is clearly inexperienced this early in his career, and delivers his lines without any panache whatsoever, which hampers the film, since his character is supposed to be a quick-witted thief.  Fortunately, he has come a long way as an actor since then.  Rutger Hauer is just plain bad.\n\nIn defense of the director and crew, the film is prettily shot (with the exception of the poorly choreographed climactic fight scene) in well lit, scenic locations.\n\nOtherwise, I would not recommend this film to anyone with expectations.\n"

aS'\tNot a great season, not a great box set...\n\tVol. 3 marks a new low for Family Guy: A season that started out strong but ended very "OH my god, I was so shocked by that hahahahaha". It seems to be riding on it\'s laurels, so to speak, and it\'s almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny. I don\'t like it, and I think it\'s been reduced to recent Simpson quality. Meanwhile, the DVD has a few commentaries (I\'d like to point out that the competition Simpson DVD\'s have commentaries on every episode, same with Futurama...)Some sub-par special features. The biggest problem here is that the first two discs are single-layer, which means four episodes per disc, as opposed to the traditional seven. We only get thirteen episodes of crap, and maybe we should be grateful, but all in all, whatever.\n\nRaoul Duke\n'

There's not even a warning that it's censored. You just buy it, pop it in your DVD player, and listen to a concert with mostly EVERY OTHER WORD jarbled up. It's a useless DVD. There's NO POINT in buying it. First Encore, now this. I've been a fan since the earlier parts of the 90's.

aS'\tThe Ghost of Sesame Street DVDs Past\n\tI was thrilled when I saw there was a new Sesame Street Christmas DVD out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized.  And, as much as I enjoy being a Sesame Street Kid (37, just like the show), I was tiring of the same stuff over and over.  \n\nImagine my surprise, then, when virtually all of this DVD is just the highlights of the others (Classic Ernie, Bert and the beloved Mr. Hooper from _Christmas Eve_, Hanukkah from _Happy Holidays_, and Bob singing "All though the Year" from _Elmo Saves Christmas" among others).  The only new part is Christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage.  \n\nIf you don\'t have the other three DVDs this would probably earn 4 stars.  If you do have the other DVDs this is not a necessity.  Hopefully next time the budget will allow Sesame Workshop to be more creative\n'

aS'\tLacks acting, but has great storyline\n\tI just had to write a review about this movie seeing that it is being made into a Hollywood film (The Departed).  I can defintely see why someone wanted to remake this movie.  After watching this movie I turned to my wife and said, "This movie would have been great if it would have stared someone/anyone with an ounce of talent!"  The acting is very affected and self-conscious... understand that\'s how Hong Kong mega-stars always act (its a sort of US 1930\'s throwback style).  I really, really despise US film remakes - but Martin must have seen the same potential so many others saw in the intriguing storyline.  I would suggest watching the US version first and coming back to the original afterward so that you do not ruin the surprises - not to mention this movie is avoidable without the new-found intrigue.  PS I have not yet seen The Departed, but I am assuming that it is a much better version than this.  HOWEVER... come on America, we have plenty of creative writers out there, can\'t we just throw them a bone rather than using old scripts and plots\n'

aS'\tNo Power\n\tThe book of Acts is a book of power!  Sadly, this is what is lacking in the DVD presentation.  The minute I began watching I knew it was going to be a weak (acting) rendition of the story.  Thankfully, it is word for word from the Bible, which is why I gave it two stars.  Reading through the book of Acts one can almost feel the electricity of the Holy Spirit working in and through the lives of the Apostles and believers.  All of that is lost in the DVD presentation.  \n\nI would not recommend this DVD.  Stick to the Book instead\n'

Trying to do 80's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more. Maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one.

aS'\tStrangely Compelling\n\tI have to agree with most of the other reviews. This movie not great art but to me it is great comedy and strangely compelling.

In fact, I am sure that Carpenter and O'Bannon are quite ashamed of this black scar that lingers in their past.  The unwitty dialogue tries to be clever all throughout the movie and is just sooo boring.  The 'effects' don't exist, and the whole alien beach ball thing is just embarrasing.  It's not funny - it is embarassing.  I could make a better movie with a handycam in my garage\n"

aS'\tHey! You got your Charmed in my Smallville!\n\tHere we go again. Another of my favorite shows starts repeating itself and treating the fans like idiots. The differences between season 3 and this drivel are STAGGERING. \n\nThey must have swapped out writers or something. How else do you explain the camera lingering on Lana Lang\'s MANY revealing showers for no reason? Let me say this as clearly as I can: Showing skin on Smallville doesn\'t work!! \n\nGood Points: Michael Rosenbaum is still the best Lex Luthor ever put on film. Sarah Carter as Alicia Baker is back! She\'s Clark Kent\'s interim girlfriend, like a psycho Lori Lemaris (who cares if she tried to slice n\' dice Lana last season and it makes NO sense for Clark to be within 50 miles of her? I don\'t). There are two new supporting characters this time, Lois and, erm...Jason. I weep for Jensen Ackles. He\'s way too good of an actor to be put through this horrible role. The way he takes a dumbly-inserted character like Lana\'s New Boyfriend and immediately makes him likable deserves him an emmy or something. Erica Durance as Lois: EASILY the worst actress, and her lines don\'t help. I don\'t really mind, because Erica LOOKS like Lois, even if her snarky remarks reach a cheese grater-level annoyance. I think Lois would work better if she just STAYED in Metropolis and we saw her only through Chloe. But I guess it\'s cheaper to keep her on the regular set. Personally I think it\'s a conspiracy to give Allison Mack less screen time. Why doesn\'t she get a revealing shower? Bah.\n\n****THINGS THAT MAKE MY BRAIN HURT:****\n1.)  Clark (somehow) becomes a quarterback for the football team. You get to see it for five episodes. What drama. Ok, this is just stupid. He\'s CHEATING, OK?? It\'s CHEATING. He can\'t just switch off his powers when he wants to. Clark\'s football career also results in the episode "Recruit", which is hazardous to your health.\n2.)  Turns out Lana\'s part-witch. I thought she was Native American? Nah, just French. And a CRINGE-worthy villain.\n3.)  PRODUCER: "Hey, doesn\'t this show remind you of Charmed?? WRITER: "Not really, but great idea!! Lets dress Lois, Lana, and Chloe is corsets and make them shoot purplish energy balls from their fingers!"\n4.)  If the writers weren\'t going to keep Jason around for more than one season, why put him in the credits?? Durr. \n5.)  Jane Seymour shows up in for the most pointless guest appearance in TV history. She does nothing for a few episodes then cashes her paycheck. Bye.\n6.)  \'Jynx\', \'Spell\', \'Recruit\', \'Sacred\', \'Spirit\' and \'Ageless\'. Oh right, and \'Forever\'. ALL LAME! They make me ashamed to watch the show! Some are so awful I don\'t think I\'ve ever watched them more than once. That\'s like HALF the dvd set. Bah.\n\nOooohh, I wonder if Clark and Lana are gonna get together this season! Just they like get together and break up EVERY season! I\'m on pins and needles!\n\nThe ONLY things keeping this from 1 star are the excellent first couple of episodes. Oh yeah, Hey writers, stop ripping off other successful shows and movies! Morons\n'
p198
aS'\tThe worst Best Picture winner ever???\n\tFirst off, let me explain why I purchased the AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS DVD in the first place, sight unseen.  One, I was trying to collect as many notable films of the 1950\'s as I could on DVD, to add to my personal library.  Two, it was the winner of the 1956 Best Picture Oscar (how bad could it be, right?).  And third, it was on sale at my local wholesaler.  So I figured, what the hey, I\'ll take a chance.\n\nTalk about a COLOSSAL disappointment.  I\'m a huge movie buff.  I\'m only 32 years old, but I love all sorts of films and genres from different periods and countries.  I love old black   white and silent films, and I don\'t shy away from foreign films either.  I\'m also a huge fan of Warner Brothers\' 2-Disc Special Edition DVDs.  I try to keep an open mind about all the films I see, but I just can\'t come up with any convincing arguments to either buy or watch this film/DVD.\n\nTo start, there is NO GOOD REASON why this film should be 3 hours long.  It could have very easily been edited down to 2, if not 90 minutes.  There is almost no script to speak of, and what little there is consists of trite exchanges and banter with barely 2 memorable lines of dialogue.  There are endless shots of open seas or country, followed by about 30 seconds of dialogue, followed by EVEN MORE endless footage of different locales.  There is no real drama or comedy going on to drive the film, and the pacing is absolutely DREADFUL... I found myself hitting the "fast-foward" button on my remote on more than a few occasions, simply because I knew I wasn\'t missing any dialogue and the establishing shots would go on for 1 or 2 minutes STRAIGHT!\n\nSecondly, the entire cast is virtually wasted.  David Niven is always a delight to watch, but is never given a chance to make Fogg truly shine.  He has one demeanor that he holds throughout:  stiff and mannered, with little or no variation.  Cantinflas, who supposedly was one of the highest paid comedians in the world at the time 80 DAYS was produced, gives us little reason to believe how or why he was such a sensation (other than doing his own stunt work).  He\'s mildly amusing at best, and his accent is so thick and mumbled that I had to rewind and replay some scenes with the "subtitle" button on.  As for the "noted" cameos... again, the actors/comedians are given little to do and barely play to their strengths and familiarity.  The only cameo actor who stuck out as having any real performance or impact was the great John Carradine (can\'t miss that voice!).\n\nIt\'s hard to believe it took THREE different writers to come up with such a frustratingly bland, lifeless and unfunny script (not to mention headscratchingly illogical... when Cantinflas rescues the Shirley MacLaine Princess character, wouldn\'t she fall in love with HIM, her actual rescuer, rather than the cool and distant Fogg, who only ordered the rescue?  Talk about a missed opportunity for some genuine comedy!).\n\nAlthough this film obviously has some fans, I wonder if it\'s only because of some overriding nostalgia factor, whether it was seeing it for the first time back in 1956 or on TV as a child.  Other than that, I can\'t understand how anyone could seriously recommend this film.  Yes, it\'s beautifully photographed, and the costumes are great, but THAT\'S IT.  I can\'t believe that 80 DAYS won the Best Picture Oscar of 1956, a year that also gave us GIANT, THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, THE KING AND I, THE SEARCHERS... hell, even FORBIDDEN PLANET or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS should have won before this overblown moving postcard.\n\nI\'m sorry to say that I probably won\'t bother watching this film again and will most likely end up reselling my DVD copy (if anyone will take it!).  Certainly my most disappointing DVD purchase EVER.  Don\'t say you weren\'t warned!\n'

aS'\tI was very disappointed\n\tI am a big fan of martial arts films  --  having lived in Taiwan.  However, this one was over-hyped in my opinion.

It was down-right goofy at times.  I really wanted this one to grab me, but it did not.\n'

aS'\tGreat ocean shots in the Bahamas\n \tI grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target....  craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation....  \n\nThe cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie.  The scenery was indeed spectacular.  The underwater diving/snorkling scenes were clear, crisp, and just what the doctor ordered.  Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful.\n\nOK, enough of the shallow stuff....  the movie was indeed much like the 70\'s flick "The Deep" which I enjoyed back then as well.  The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor, honest, and happy folks (most of us would love to really be this happy - let\'s face it!) The introduction of Bryce (played by Scott Caan) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers, twists, etc.  \n\nOverall, the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives.  Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks?  No, but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9-5 job every day.\n'

The energy is high, and its a great time!\nI had the priviledge of meeting him, and blubbered like an idiot, but he is just as cool a guy as he seems. He really appreciates his fan base, and understands how important it is for us to see him live. Im glad that finally, I can share with my friends who have never see Edwin live, what an amazing artist he really is!!!!\n'

aS"\tVery Well Made\n \tOtto Preminger's EXODUS is a very well made film. This is a big film and director Preminger is a master at handling films of this scale. He is a master technician and he tells this story on that level rather than showing anything highly stylistic in nature. Well, that is Preminger's style, straighforward and technically proficient movie making.\n"

aS'\tRealistic?  No way...but SO MUCH FUN!\n \tI got a kick out of one of the recent reviews that trashes this movie as unrealistic -- the kids are not doing what they need to do to get into college.  Good grief.  Since when is a musical ever realistic??  Especially one that is geared to kids.  Hello??!! It\'s not supposed to be realistic!  If you expect realism, go elsewhere.  But if you want to have some fun with a great message not-so-subtly woven in, then watch this movie.  Kids love it (mine do along with anyone else I\'ve talked to), and the message is just terrific ~ it\'s okay to be yourself with all kinds of wild likes, dislikes, hobbies, etc., no matter what anyone else thinks.  I love it!  I can\'t even begin to say how much better this is than "Grease," the high school musical of my day where the heroine had to give in and become a slut to get what she wanted and be "happy."  Relax with your kids, go get some popcorn, and have some fun with the Wildcats kids from "Highschool Musical.\n'

aS'\tGirl Play\n \tI was amased at how very well acted, directed and written this movie was. The dialogue was sharp and you might have to watch twice to get all the subtle quips. Everyone was well cast. It is great movie for anyone and transcends the lesbo-film cliche. It transcends because the themes are universal and you forget it\'s a "gay" movie. If you hated "Go Fish" like I did, you\'ll love this movie and go "whew" for this film - it saves our lesbian cinema souls! Buy it! you won\'t be sorr\n'

aS"\tA Very Good (But Sad) Movie\n \tAll of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn't like with a badly made movie. This is a very well made movie, with perfectly competent performances. The tone is quite serious, and the ending won't cheer anyone up. But then there are many people who loved Titanic, which I found utterly depressing. More to the point, though, who cares about the problems of these rich kids? Not me. The REAL reason to watch this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful. And if you enjoy this film, check out Less Than Zero, another gloomy but solid ( and  underrated) '80s film. The WORST '80s film is Bright Lights, Big City - don't say I didn't warn you!\n"

aS'\trequiem\n \tI just watched this movie last night.  I came across the title on someone\'s MySpace and being a Jared Leto fan I wanted to watch it.  I had also read a few reviews and talked to some people who said the film was riveting.  \n\nRiveting is the very least I can say about this film.  It is as the Amazon editorial review puts it, "a tour through hell."  This film makes you think.   The fact that all the addicts succumbed to their addictions seems a little out there to me but I keep wondering is it so far fetched . . . ?  How many people are there that actually DO escape addictions?  You might escape one but more than likely you will soon replace it with another.\n\nDuring the film I kept trying to see the positive side of it all and hoping that there was some middle ground; some little piece of hope left.  I was wrong.  The film didn\'t depict drug use the way that I had expected to see it; the way I had seen it depicted in countless other films.\n\nAll of the ugly aspects of drug use were put out there for your viewing pleasure.  Personally I found it painful to watch.  There  were moments when I actually thought of turning it off but for some reason continued to watch.  I think that reason was the hypnotic trancelike style of the film.  The truth is that I COULDN\'T stop watching.  The film put me directly in the shoes of the addict.\n\nI felt like the addicts in the film  . . . my hands sweaty and my heart pounding.  I couldn\'t close my eyes.  I want to see it again sometime.  I would like to watch it with my husband.  I bought the movie before I had ever watched it the first time.\n\nThe film was painfully realistic, genuinely graphic, appalling and appealing at the same exact time.  A MUST see.\n\nOverall I think it is a wonderful film to add to any collection.  Personally it is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched.  I think the acting in the movie was outstanding, the direction was genius, and the plot was amazingly horrific.\n\nAll in all this is an 5 star film\n'

aS'\t"Am gonna be on Television !!!!"\n \tA deeply emotional film about Addiction, Love, and Family just to some, but when you watch this film you take something with you , something to be greatful for that everyone takes for granted, LIfe. Each character in this film has a heart breaking unhappy ending, really depressing movie but worth a look at least once. Marlon Wayans and Jennifer Connelly were extremely good but Ellen Burstyn broke my heart her performance Rocked\n'

aS'\tNot every film was shot in widescreen\n \tAccording to IMDb, "Moulin Rouge" was shot in 1.37, not widescreen.  Therefore you\'re not losing that much to view this in 1.33 (full screen) format\n'

aS"\tVery interesting..\n \tI really had no idea what life was like for photographers who do this kind of work. I'm a photographer but not this line of work. It was an interesting glimpse into their lives. I wouldnt say you will learn much about photography but you do learn what kind of issues they have to deal with being on location in foreign countries, personal techniques or styles of certain photographers and hear what they look for when shooting. Some places conditions were less than desirable but they got some amazing shots to make it worth it.\n"
p217
aS"\tBeautiful Film\n \tMost likely this review will not be very helpful to anyone, but I wanted to comment on how beautifully done this film is.  I am a long time U2 fan and had seen Rattle and Hum, but didn't get around to purchasing the DVD until late 2005.  The fact that the music is wonderful is a given, but the cinematography is just astounding.  I love how you get to see everything from every point of view.  You get to see what the band sees on and around the stage, including the breathtaking sea of fans.  You get to see what the fans see -- the spectacular lighting and silhouettes.  You get to hear what the guys think and feel off-stage as well as on.  And of course you get the passionate music.  The film is as beautiful to watch as it is to listen to.  I couldn't ask for more\n"
p218
aS'\tA Classic Haunted House/ Ghost Story\n \tFirst of all, I have lost count of the ammount of times I have seen this movie but every time I watch it I get goose bumps. This is how affective the movie is.\n\nGeorge C. Scott (of "Patton" fame) plays a composer who rents a house to live in while he teaches and tries to cope with tragedy. Soon the house begins to exhibit strange occurances and Mr. Scott begins to investige the house\'s history. This is all you need to know about the plot because anything else would ruin the film.\n\nThis movie is all about atmosphere. There are no scenes of gore and slaughter like so many big budget horror films nowadays. This film does not need to gross the viewer out. The Changeling simply tells a great story as the viewer learns about the house and witnesses the haunting at the same time as the characters. You are pulled into this film because it entertains and frightens with ease. There is nothing "in your face" about the scares. \n\nThis film is for fans of the 1960\'s film "The Haunting" or anyone who just enjoys a good ghost story. Don\'t even bother to rent it because it cheap enough to buy and I guarantee you\'ll watch it more than once. I have recommended it to many people and I never heard a negative comment. For the full effect, wait until night to watch it and then watch it alone. See how many times you glance over your shoulder.\n'
p219
aS'\tFunny Carey, interesting adaptation\n \tI saw this movie before I read the books. The books are much funnier, and contain so much more than was able to be put into the film. Still, I liked the film and especially Baby Sunny. I thought Jim Carey was an excellent mad uncle after the family treasure and his facial expressions (as always) brought the character to life. I think that even though many things were cut from the first three books of a long series in order to put it all into a feature length film, the essence of the story was captured, and is entertaining. But I do recommend reading the Series before or after watching the film\n'
p220
aS'\tBest 3D IMAX Film\n \t"Haunted Castle" and "Alien Adventure" are great, but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of "Encounter in the Third Dimension" makes it better than the other two.  The film is an excellent way of showing how 3D started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in, other than the entire movie itself.  I do wish the mine ride was longer though (the one which ends with the big, round, stone ball slamming into the tunnel) and there was more shown of the T3 Experience.  Sure, the Jules Verne "Journey to the Center of the Earth" ride certainly makes up for it, but the effects in the shorter example were awesome, like the bats.  Best of all, the film doesn\'t look all that dated CGI wise for a 1998 production.  Now I\'ve definitely got to get the sequel "Misadventures in 3D" DVD.  Noticed something stupid in the credits for "Encounter".  Instead of saying "Cassandra Peterson as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark", it redundantly reads, "Elvira as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark".  Unlike the other 3D IMAX films, this one is good either in stereo depth form or 2D wise.  Of course, the best is 3D since that is the whole point of the story anyway.  I highly recommend this movie to all 3D collectors\n'

aS'\tWow!\n \tLove this DVD SO much! The actors are super, and the story is hilarious!\nIf you liked the first one, GET this one\n'
p222
aS'\tUnique and Entertaining,\n \tThe first thing you will notice with this one is the strange animation. It\'s hard to even describe really... But expect some disoriented backgrounds with some CGI thrown in. The plot however, is excellent. The main focus is about a author is going around collecting ghost stories. He constantly runs into a trio of outlawish justice seekers. They do what is called "committing" someone for their sins. These first 4 episodes deal with single episode told stories but all are great. This anime is highly reccomended for the horror fans out there\n'
p223
aS"\tThis is reality....\n \tWhat's so 'ugly' about this movie?  Because it depicts the truth?  To all you parents out there, this is exactly what teenagers do on a daily basis.  I know because I was once a teenager too, and this movie hits the mark.  This is what happens when parent's don't have a solid relationship with their kids.  This movie is not ugly, its just the straight up truth which most people don't like to recognize.  It's up to us as parents to guide our children in the right direction so this type of behavior can be minimized\n"

aS'\tAn Enchanting Fairy Tale\n \tElla of Frell (Anne Hathaway) is an unusual child.  As a baby, a bumbling fairy godmother named Lucinda (Vivica A. Fox) gave her the gift of obedience.  Every time anyone gives her a direct command, she must obey.\n\nDespite, or maybe because of, this "gift," Ella grows to be a headstrong woman.  She goes against the conventional wisdom of the realm when it comes to ogres, giants, and elves.  Current rules state that these creatures are dangerous and must perform certain jobs only.  But Ella campaigns for their equality.\n\nShe is also one of the few women in the realm who doesn\'t swoon at the site of Prince Char (Hugh Dancy).  When the two meet accidentally, Char finds this distain quite refreshing and immediately begins to fall for the headstrong young woman.\n\nTrouble is brewing at home, however.  Ella\'s stepsister Hattie (Lucy Punch) has figured out Ella\'s secret.  Now, Ella finds herself doing things she would never willing do.  So she leaves home and sets out to find Lucinda to give the gift back.\n\nI had missed seeing this movie in the theater, and finally got a chance to watch it.  I missed a real treat.  The movie is funny from start to finish, and I had a grin on my face the entire time.  While the story is a bit predictable, it isn\'t super preachy.  The cast does an amazing job bring their characters to life.  The only drawback to the movie is the special effects.  While some worked well, most of the time they weren\'t up to today\'s standards.\n\nWhile the main audience might be teen girls, this is one adult male who loved it.  It\'s sweet, charming, and entertaining.  What more could you want\n'

aS"\tThe best live-action film yet for Walt Disney films!\n \tThis film is the best film that Disney has in it's live-action collection! Every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life. I really like all the extras on the disc as well I like seeing how the film was created, looking at deleted scenes, learning about the history of real pirates, and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of Walt Disney himself\n"

aS'\tGREAT WORKOUT!\n \tI\'ve seen the Pilates infomercials for a while now, but have been intimidated by the seemingly impossible movements. When I found this inexpensive "For Dummies" DVD, I decided to give it a try. WHAT A WORKOUT! I consider myself to be in moderately good shape, and this workout can definitely be felt! Within the first couple of days I IMMEDIATELY noticed a change in my posture, and a good burn in my abs, hips and thighs. I HIGHLY recommend this as both a great workout and a wonderful intro to Pilates.\n'

aS'\tEnduring fun in every respect, gets better with age...\n \tNewman, Redford, Robert Shaw as the bad guy, twists and turns and wry humor every 20 frames or so...how can anyone not like "The Sting"? When I saw it on the big screen upon its first release, I did not think it deserved the Oscar as best film of its year, although I enjoyed it. Now, decades later, and after having seen it perhaps 20 times, at least in pieces, I think it one of the best achievements in movie-making in its century. It has STYLE, and a consistent sensibility, and logic, and on first viewing, it will keep you guessing as to who is going to come out on top. I can\'t imagine that anyone over 30 hasn\'t seen it yet, but if that\'s you, fix it as soon as possible. It is a primer in how to write, direct and act in a fairly long movie without ever boring the audience. Newman\'s drunken card-player on the train with Shaw is absolutely classic\n'

aS"\tGreat!  Another Maryland Masterpiece\n \tIf you love John Waters then you're already right there with me.  I would classify this as a bit tame compared to his other offings and similar in style and irony to the movie Grease but is a more self-aware film.\n\nI love rooting for the Drapes and the idea that the Squares can become Drapes, which, thematically, seems to be a Waterian theme - that we can all get along if we have sex with each other.  Which is probably true John.\n\nOh yeah, and Johnny Depp is young here and cool and I think you will enjoy seeing both Ricki Lake and Tracy Lords and Willem Dafoe as well (I know I did)\n"
p231
aS'\tThis film is a powerful concentration of life in a small area of Italy.\n \tAlthough subtitled Grazia\'s island (Grazia is the lead role, magnificently realized by Valeria Golino), "Respiro" could have well been called "Scenes from rural Sicilian life", as the scenography, cinematography and tableaux-like imagery seem as important to the director as her thin narrative line. Respiro\'s locale is Lampedusa, a tiny island far off the west coast of Sicily. About the same latitude as Malta, this place is about as remote as it gets - Tunisia is closer than Palermo. It can be safe to say that Italian time here has pretty much stood still for decades; this is Italy of de Sica and Mascagni, not Fellini and Prada. The men go out to sea, the children play, women pack fish, old black-clad crones meddle and the languid summer air of total boredom hangs down from the cloudless sky.\n\nThroughout this film you would probably ask yourself, "Is she really as crazy as the family and neighbors think she is or just free spirited?" It\'s a fairly typical story, the type that a few great (and many, many average) Italian filmmakers have been serving up for the last three generations - life in the sun drenched rural, ritualistic and tribal south and the saga of one village denizen who dares to break the moulds. How long since "Cinema Paradiso?"\n\nWhat I like most about the movie, besides the appealing scenery, was the interrelations of the characters, the humor, petty gossips, the impromptu emotional outbursts, the displays of maternal and filial affection. The two boys are tremendous: the older Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) is the more mature of the two. The younger Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) has an unregulated diarrhea mouth filled with hilarious and inspired ravings, often without sense. His rant against the busybody women is a treasure, as is his little-brother-as-big-brother protectiveness of his sister from the policeman-friend. The boy embodies an epic Italianate inflammability far beyond his years. While viewing this I thought the son\'s affection was overtly and uncomfortably oedipal at times. They do spend a lot of time and energy comforting their mom plus defending her against verbal attacks in the village.\n\nAfter seeing this film, I have realized that the rural lives by the sea in many countries are similar, the differences are in the languages, but the feelings are same.  I enjoyed this film so much I might see it a couple of times.\n'
p232
aS"\tVery intense and provocative\n \tYour milage may vary; but I found this movie white-knuckle intense and extremely provocative.  There is little danger of giving away the plot; it is not particularly complex.  Three stupid, arrogant American teenagers tempt fate by crossing an unguarded gate from Finland to the former USSR, which at the time was very much the USSR and a Very Bad Place for Americans.  They make photographs of themselves on the wrong side of the gate.  So far so good, but then they get lost and go the wrong way right into the hands of the Russians who mistake them for spies.  Some interesting subplots are also happening that keep things moving, that I'll keep a secret for ya.  I can promise you one thing:  If you are American, after seeing this, you'll salute the flag, think real hard before traveling overseas and I'll bet you never photograph yourself on the wrong side of an international border\n"

aS'\tFred Astaire, Rita Hayworth, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer...And "I\'m Old Fashioned"\n \tIn some of Fred Astaire\'s movies there\'s only one excellent reason to watch, and that\'s to watch Fred Astaire. In You Were Never Lovelier there are three other excellent reasons. Rita Hayworth. Jerome Kern. Johnny Mercer. The four of them have concocted a romantic and funny South American fable that features some great dancing by both Astaire and Hayworth and some memorable songs by Kern and Mercer.\n\nEduardo Acuna (Adolphe Menjou), a wealthy Buenos Aires businessman, has four beautiful daughters, and in the Acuna family they must marry in age order. The eldest fulfills her responsibilities and the two youngest have beaus they\'re now anxious to share vows with. But the second eldest, Maria (Rita Hayworth) is in no hurry. She wants romance and charm and the men she meets are just panting boys. Then she sees Robert Davis (Fred Astaire), a very charming, down-on-his-luck dancer, singing Dearly Beloved at her elder sister\'s wedding. He tries to chat her up; she stares him down. Then the plot intervenes. Before long she knows what she wants. Robert knows what he wants. Eduardo Acuna knows what he doesn\'t want...a down-on-his-luck dancer in the family. From then on it\'s songs, dances, romance and misunderstandings, which moves into songs, dances and romance. The plot feels sluggish at times and there\'s way too much Xavier Cugat and his orchestra, but Astaire and Hayworth are at their peak, Kern has written some memorable melodies and few could top Mercer at lyric writing, none in Hollywood.\n\nHayworth not only was a gorgeous creature, she was a gifted dancer; many think she was the best Astaire worked with. Technically, she not only handled the steps Astaire created, she did so without a hint of effort. After you\'ve watched the dances a couple of times, go back and watch again, but this time concentrate on her face and her hand and arm action. She gives every indication of being utterly relaxed and enjoying herself, even in the fast tap routines. She seems naturally to find the most graceful attitude for an extended arm, a turn of her head, a raised hand. She may not be quite as good as Astaire, but she\'s good enough.\n\nAmong the stand-out routines are:\n--The Audition Dance. Robert shows up at Acuna\'s office and demands a chance to show his stuff as a dancer. From there Astaire takes off on a fast tap routine that takes him all over the floor, onto Acuna\'s desk, the sofa and chairs. He works into the dance a cane, a rug, the drapes and Acuna\'s head. \n\n--I\'m Old Fashioned. This is probably the best romantic wooing dance Astaire did. It\'s all fluid motion and spontaneous recognition, danced on the elegant, polished outdoor landing of Acuna\'s mansion. Rita Hayworth is a vision, and matches him step for step. We move from Maria declaring with humor and assurance that Robert\'s the man for her, to Robert\'s protestation that he\'s just a guy from Omaha, Nebraska, to the dance that brings them closer and closer together until we know through the dance that a love match has just happened. The funny exit through the doors and back into the living-room, bumping into each other, each giving way, bumping again and then going in together arm in arm hits just the right note. The dance works so well in part because Kern and Mercer came up with a classic:\nI\'m old fashioned,\nI love the moonlight,\nI love the old fashioned things.\nThe sound of rain\nUpon a window pane,\nThe starry song that April sings.\nThis year\'s fancies\nAre passing fancies\nBut sighing sighs, holding hands,\nThese my heart understands.\nI\'m old fashioned\nBut I don\'t mind it.\nThat\'s how I want to be,\nAs long as you agree,\nTo stay old fashioned with me.\n\n--The Shorty George. This fast tap routine starts out with Maria visiting Robert at a rehearsal. He sings The Shorty George and she takes a couple of lines. He looks surprised that she knows the song. He starts to dance and invites her to join him. Hayworth stays right with Astaire and looks like she\'s having the time of her life.\n\n--You Were Never Lovelier. Robert declares his feelings for Maria, but more misunderstandings occur. Finally, everything is resolved. Robert shakes off some knight\'s armor he was wearing (there is sort of a reason) and appears below Maria\'s bedroom window in black tie. She rushes down...and off they go dancing while all the members of the Acuna family look on approvingly. And the Johnny Mercer lyrics and Jerome Kern music brings us to the happy end:\nYou were never lovelier, you were never so fair; \nDreams were never lovelier,\nPardon me if I stare.\nDown the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face;\nI can only say they chose the proper place.\nYou were never lovelier, and to coin a new phrase, \nI was never luckier\nIn my palmiest days.\nMake a note, and you can quote me, honor bright,\nYou were never lovelier than you are tonight\n'

aS"\tTerrific portrait of life confronted with death\n \tAt Ikiru's opening, I started to have real doubts about the film. I had heard that this was Kurosawa's best, and the film was built up just enough to come crashing down.\n\nLuckily, that didn't happen.\n\nThe narrator of the film reminded me of Criswell's narrations to Plan 9 from Outer Space. The film seemed to say too much and show too little. Then as the narrator continued during an extremely long take of our hero Mr. Watanabe at work, something clicked. The long duration of the shot and the narrator's continued breakdown of the man's less wholesome characteristics gave the impression that he was breaking down our lives, that the narration is coming from the back of our own minds, and that we are powerless to silence it.\n\nThat floored me, and for the rest of the film, I remained awe-stricken by this humble yet miserable man. Takashi Shimura gives one of the greatest performances I've seen since Raging Bull. Here is a guy whose really pissed off at the world, but he's smart enough to know he has only himself to blame for the mediocrity his life has been dealt. The horror on his face when he learns of his cancer will remain with me for a long time.\n\nThere are points at which the film seems to drag on, but never without purpose. When he dies, having finally given meaning to his existence, his coworkers and family members recount the final days with pity, confusion, and finally admiration. The scene lags, which makes us that much more insulted by their ignorance\n"
p236
aS'\tsexy and sharp "cops and robbers" film with a twist.....\n \tThis is a great film that preceded the onset of the "JLo."  "Out of Sight" is a great showcase for Jennifer Lopez\'s talent as an actress.  It is a shame that she hasn\'t been presented with more great roles, like that of Karen Sisco, in this film.  Karen is a D.A, who carries a rifle and a jaded attitude. She has a chance encounter with charming, compulsive bank robber Jack Foley (George Clooney).  Their encounter is made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would-be kidnapping of Sisco in her OWN car. It is no surprise that sparks fly.....however, this doesn\'t downplay the complexities of their star-crossed encounter.  \n\nSome of the greatest strong points of this film include the juxtaposition of flashbacks, incorporating trick camera work and voice overs.  What\'s more, this film was shot in a very bare bones style.  We don\'t get a sense of romance, so much as a feeling of stark reality.  The colors are dark, the dialogue between the characters is honest, real and simply wonderful.  This film has a potential for mass appeal, due to the fact that, though it does get gritty and violent, that doesn\'t downplay its intelligence or originality.  Violence is counterbalanced by genuinely funny scenes, as well as more introspective glimpses at how the characters turned out as they did.  This is definitely a great date film!!\n'
p237
aS'\tOut of Sight\n \tThis was one of the best movies of 1998, but for whatever reason did not attract a large audience.  When I try to think of superlatives to desribe it, the one that keeps coming to mind is "cool."\n\nMost of the coolness factor is owed to two things:  Steven Soderbergh\'s steady directing and the chemistry between the actors, especially George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Back before we knew that Clooney would go on to channel the same character in virtually all of his roles, he defined suave in this movie.  And back before she was J.Lo, Lopez was that IN LIVING COLOR fly girl with the big ole butt trying to make a name for herself as a film actress.  Here she gives the best performance of her career.\n\nWhile all of the cast (Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina, Albert Brooks and Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson in cameos) is solid, after Clooney and Lopez the real star is Don Cheadle.  He is quite convincing as the prison boxer Snoopy.  He oozes rage and steals every scene that he\'s in.\n\nPlots based on books by Elmore Leonard tend to be above average, but are mostly dependent upon the colorful characters he writes.  Thanks to the talent of all involved, this movie is one of the best\n'

aS'\t"Very little of life is completely under one\'s control"\n \tHappiness can be delicate. In just one swoop, it can stolen out from under you, just when you least expect it. The results can be often devastating - some can never recover. The family in the Italian film The Son\'s Room has found such happiness, but when tragedy suddenly strikes, they\'re engulfed in a whirlwind of grief and paralyzed with heartache.\n\nGrief is perhaps the most tangled of human emotions, and the vagaries of sadness, love, and anger that comprise its essence are often very difficult to portray. Luckily, co-writer, director, and actor Nanni Moretti avoids all the usual clich s in this delicately nuanced and subtly acted film. The Son\'s Room is indeed a moving and weighty depiction of one family\'s attempts to heal after sudden death strikes them. \n\nMoretti stars as Giovanni, a successful psychiatrist with a busy practice treating the assorted neurotics of the picture-perfect Northern Italian coastal town he and his family call home. Giovanni is a mild-mannered and kindly man, who has a sort of passive and submissive approach to living. \n\nGiovanni also has a lovely family: he\'s happily married to gorgeous book publisher Paola (Laura Morante) and shares what he considers a close relationship with his teenaged daughter Irene (Jasmine Trinca) and son Andrea (Giuseppe Sanfelice). \n\nHe presides over his wife and two children with a kind of flaccid authority, enveloping them with the same deceptively passive doctoral concern with which he counsels his psychiatric patients. He supports, and heals, less by what he says than by what he doesn\'t say. He quietly coaches Andrea in soccer moves, while encouraging Irene to be more competitive at basketball. \n\nPerhaps it\'s an ominous portent of what is to come, but the film opens as Andrea and his friends have been accused of stealing a valuable fossil from the school\'s Science department. Giovanni and Paola are surprised to find they entertaining the idea that their son may in fact be guilty as charged. However, no one takes the incident that seriously.\n\nIf this is the only drama that affects Giovanni\'s serene life, nothing prepares him for the sudden tragedy that occurs one sunny Sunday afternoon. Called away from home by a desperate client, Giovanni cancels his plans to go jogging with Andrea; and it\'s a fatal choice that haunts him for months to come. \n \nThe accident, when it happens, is so unexpected. The loss giving rise to sorrow, rage, tenderness, and the inexplicable feeling that hope is no longer possible. The family, emotionally fractured, is unable to continue on. Plunged into unimaginable grief, Giovanni attempts to carry on with his life, but bereft of his objectivity, he finds he\'s no longer able to function as an analyst.\n\nThe Son\'s Room, with it\'s subtle acting and its pensive, emotionally layered story, remains a startling testament to the delicate nuances of grief. And it\'s as though Moretti has invited the viewer to spy on a deeply personal event in the life of a very ordinary family. Like a fly on the wall we witness the sadness, the regret, the empty dinners and the overwhelming feeling of whether they could have done anything to stop the accident. \n\nMoretti, whose eyes glitter with knowledge from within a bland, bearded, professorial face, gives a wonderful performance, as does the classy Morente as the beautiful, anguished Paola. While Giovanni wanders dazed through a theme park, numb to the grief, Paola fields a desire to talk about the absent child. \n\nA savior for the family arrives in a letter addressed to the deceased, and when the writer appears on the family\'s doorstep, she offers the grace note that reminds them of the means by which happiness eventually repairs itself and the unavoidable fact that life goes on. There\'s no catharsis here, only a heartfelt exploration of what it means to grieve. Mike Leonard August 05.\n'

aS'\tWhat Men Do\n \tThis series is awesome, and I am incredibly happy to have it to watch over and over.  It speaks to the depths of the soul of a man.  Having experienced intense pain, though not in war, I find the emotion and the comeradery very intensely satisfying in this series.  This bonding is what men were meant to do, not just in war, but in our every day battles.  The sense of brotherhood among people with only one major event in common is instructional.  I recommend this for any group of buddies, or even church groups\n'

aS"\tSigns is One of Our Favorite Films\n \tNot only does the movie Signs offer a wonderfully different kind of alien/ufo tale, but its characters are very likable and the story is about much more than aliens from another planet. The story's true question is this: does everything just happen by chance, or is God caring for His children in ways they simply cannot understand? Signs is the story of hope lost, faith put aside because of intense pain and grief, and how one man's relationship with God affects the lives of those around him. We were amazed by how truly moving this film is, as well as how humorous it can be, and we were impressed with the acting of all the cast. Does everything just happen by chance, or is God caring for His children in ways they simply cannot understand?\n"

aS"\tarrested development is back for more\n \tOne thing about Arrested Development that I forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years.  What I found funny last year when I was watching the show is JUST as consistently funny now.  In fact, now that I understand the style of humor better, I think the show is even funnier now.  \n\nFox had something good cooking with Arrested Development.  It seems whenever a show doesn't get the ratings a network wants, a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings.  It VERY rarely works, and sadly Arrested Development is another example of this.  \n\nI can't blame Fox for pulling the plug.  After all, they tried their hardest to promote the show.  I remember Sunday nights watching the Simpsons and during the commercials the people at Fox REALLY wanted viewers to tune in.  The writers of the show should be proud that Fox tried very hard to keep it on the air.  It's just unfortunate people didn't want to watch it.  I still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy, Arrested Development would be around today.  \n\nAs it stands, 53 episodes are all we have of this great show.  Honestly, it's not enough, but will have to do.  \n\nDo we really NEED anymore laugh track comedies?  Aren't there more than enough of them on the air now?  Most of these shows people won't even recognize when they hear the name of them because there's so many.  Most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same, and they blend together.  One plainly obvious joke after another.  I'm bored just thinking about it.  We've reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot, and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to Arrested Development is the right move, in my opinion.  The times need to change.  \n\nPeople make a big deal about Arrested Development because there's really NOTHING else like it on television.  That's why the show deserves all the 5-star ratings it has received here on amazon.  People wouldn't be praising the show so much if there wasn't a good reason for it.  Trust me, there's a reason for all the positive reviews.  Buy one of the DVD season sets, pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave, watch the show *carefully* and experience the joy so many people are raving about.\n"

aS"\tSeven Brides for Seven Brothers - True Entertainment\n \tThis 1954 musical release is just too good/too fun to pass up. Adam (Howard Keel - oh my god, what a voice) needs a wife and zeros in on Milly (Jane Powell) to drag back to his Oregon Territory farm and six unruly brothers. The tiny beauty has a backbone and rises to the challenge. Milly makes believers out of them. The brothers decide they want wives of their own and kidnap more cuties from town. Whoops, they forgot to drag the preacher along too and the pass gets snowed-in for winter.\n\nThe songs are lovely, the story charming, but it's the dance choreography that brings me back again and again. There are two numbers in particular which showcase the brothers' dance skills, and they are outstanding. Julie Newmar of Catwoman fame is one of the kidnapped cuties. They stick her in the back or whisk her out completely for the more involved dance routines, but who cares, it's Julie Newmar\n"

aS'\tNIcely done, but quite condensed\n \tThis continuation of the Anne series on screen is very well done, and captures the flavor of the characters and story as well as the first installment did.  The only problem is that it drastically condenses the three books it supposedly covers.  What it really does is just focus on a few key incidents, and drastically truncates Anne\'s college and teaching experiences.  Morgan Harris and family have been created to very basically cover the story components of Roy Gardner, Sophy Sinclair, Old Mrs. Gibson and Pauline, and Elizabeth.  This installment ends with Anne and Gilbert becoming engaged.  \nI highly recommend it - just don\'t expect the same level of detail as "Anne of Green Gables" provided\n'

aS"\tOnce and Future Hamlet\n \tBrilliant is an often overworked phrase, but in the case of *Hamlet* starring Mel Gibson, the word cannot be used enough.  For brevity's sake, I will save Zeffirelli's cudos for another time and place except to say that he has done a good thing.  This review is for Chris Devore and his beautiful working and dramturgy of the more than difficult Shakespeare script.  Devore somehow makes it better.  Were he in London, late 1500's, he would have been a collaborator, making Will's work the pearl it is today.  My only plea is that, at some date, we will get to see Gibson give the advice to the players which was omitted so that other pieces could be spared.\n\nThis may have been Glenn Close's best work.  This is not a complaint, but rather a sign that anyting else she may have or has done cannot be any better than this wonderful, small role.  Ophelia (Close) has an important commentary that must be heard in order for the play to work - Will was no fool - and it needs a Close to do it.\n\nAlan Bates has been a staple of English theatre and screen and has delivered many fine parts (such as Gabriel Oaks in *Far From the Madding Crowd*, 1967).  As Claudius, the regicide and brother of Hamlet, Senior, Bates makes you believe that his reign could have been noble except for that one small cancer, that flaw in his character - very clintonian and very believable.\n\nI have wanted to kick Ian Holm's ever since Ash hurt Ripley in *Alien*, 1979.  I have to keep reminding myself that he really is that believable and that I really don't hate him, It's the character he has created so well.  His body of work is repleat with characters of such believability that you forget his name - IAN HOLM - until he does it again, the next time, in the next movie.  If films were strictly Hasidic, Holm's version of Polonius would be Kosher.  There is not one piece of ham in his entire performance. It is worth the purchase of the DVD just to see him act.\n\nEveryone is good in the movie and there is not time to talk about all of them.  But a note to those whose noses are airbourne and won't tolerate anyone but Olivier as Hamlet.  There are several uneven performances in his excellent movie.  There are no uneven performances in this piece.\n\nFinally, we come to the mad prince of Denmark.  It is most astonishing that I watched this epic again after Mel's dark night of the troll, thrashing about in complete insanity, arguably brought on by hard likker, frustration, and stupidity.  Yet with all said, Gibson IS the essential Hamlet.  You will find no other actor who delivers the goods the way the Cruiser from the Boozer does.\n\nYou know this is true, not just by watching the exquisite performance on the DVD, but by Gibson's own marvelling at what was accomplished, not because of some actor's raison d'etre, but rather by the actor's very ability to understand that he is dealing with things that go beyond the ken of normal humans.  IS Hamlet crazy, or crazy like a fox?  And when is he crazy we get to hear Mel say in the devastating interview he made for the DVD release many years gone by.\n\nSo, enough from me.\n\nIf you want to see the best Hamlet ever, buy this DVD and feast.\n\n- Dick Anderso\n"

aS"\tStunning, Deep  and  Mysterious\n \tI woke up this morning with a burning desire to remember the end of Fellini Satyricon.  Someone is mortally wounded, the blonde guy?  And lies there dying, watching his best friend go off with the boy they both desired, Gitone, and some dancing leaping black guy....  I think.  \n   I've seen it probably 9 times, it always was a favorite when I was a teen and older, but I haven't seen it for years.  But it was so visually entrancing, and so truly pre-Christian -- that is, made from that standpoint, which movies seldom are or can be!  \n    I just remember the wonderul images, a boat rising in the mist, the strange tenement bldg they (Ascylto and Encolpio) live in, the sea monster, the bacchanale, the hermaphrodite's cavern, the Minotaur.....  endless, splendid, dreamlike images on and on....\n  [I wonder why it is Italians are such master of the visual in this manner; I think of Visconti, Antonioni, even Scorsese and the American-Italians -- maybe it's that Renaissance artist legacy?]\n\nFrom my buddy:  Like you, I saw it a few times, decades ago.  The images are so strong and mysterious. Images that render volumes of emotions that are so deep, echoing a memory that is never realized. Modern day, Scorsese manages it. Zefferelli too.\nThat is true film-making. Even the older films from De Sica capture images that are unforgettable. Wells has done it.\nBut what you're talking about, is, I suppose, secular in nature. Icons derived from the human experience that has meaning from within the human soul. Not from an outward omnipresence of theology.  Satyricon is almost existential, as a presentation of true human nature. Done with frame-paintings. And framed in such a way that is evocative.  Amazing dream art!\n"

aS'\tin regard to the two first posts...\n \tI am not sure why the first person would direct people to read J. Michael Bailey\'s work... or why the second person would say that it is as if J. Michael Bailey wrote this himself...one he couldn\'t have because it is a documentary, and two his view points are way off compared to the one given by the documentary.  Considering his book is very demeaning of the trans community. And he was forced to resign from Northwestern University as the department head, because of his illegal uses of his patient\'s information in his book. \n\n"They seem like different species, because they are."\n       I am not sure if I would say that the kids in this documentary are another species... or even that I am another species. They are humans as well and to reduce them to another species is simply rediculous. \n\n   I am not sure why everyone is referencing him, because his view on Transgender people is extremely negative.\n\n... but to the documentary. I think that it gives a great overall view of the trans community, showing that we can stem from all different backrounds, and we can act in all different ways. Just as there are many different "normal" gendered people, there are many different trans people as well.  I believe that  ScubaOtter "seaotter7"  has the best overview of it.\n'

aS"\tA surprisingly deep, funny, and charming film!\n \tIt is nice to see Bebe Neuwirth in something other than Cheers.\n\nOscar (Aaron Stanford) is too sophisticated for girls his age but not for his stepmother (Sigourney Weaver) and Bebe Neuwirth (the seductress). Women are all over him. His stepmom ignores him and chiropractor thinks she finds the romantic she's always dreamed of. The joking innuendos are quite hilarious reminding me of the Graduate. Gary Winnick (the director) shot this movie on a digital camera in two weeks and won raves at the festivals.\n\nThe little captions before or after a scene kinda tell you how Oscar is working or getting worked over. John Ritter (Dad, apparently serious but funny) and the whole cast gives strong performances certainly earning their street creed.\n\nYou'll find charming nuggets of truth in this movie, quite a bit of wit, and hilarity. Sure, Oscar is 15 and, rather than opening his eyes to girls, they open his. His daydreams about his stepmom are electrifyingly filmed.\n\nAs for the morality, I think people are a little paranoid over this taut, striking film. If you are openminded, you'll find this film is more about coming of age than what narrow minded people think. It is a light film to the touch and men will probably be reliving high school fantasies about the older woman. Women will like it because it shows how men are nothing more than putty in their hands. It is just amazing how much depth this film has in 77 minutes!\n\nRachel Alice Hunter\nChairwoman\nTeardropfilms Entertainment Corporatio\n"

aS'\tA Great Coming of Age Film\n \tBend It Like Beckham is a very enjoyable coming of age film for teen aged girls.  The film sensitively portrays a young Indian girl\'s difficulties in convincing her parents that playing soccer is a worthwhile activity that can help her develop her identity and well being.  The film is enjoyable on several levels: 1) there is the cultural clash between Britons of various descent, 2) there is the hilarious "lesbian" mixup, and 3) the pure sports film.  All in all a very enjoyable experience and a great film for young people\n'

aS'\tBEST BARGAIN ON AMAZON (OR ANYWHERE ELSE)\n \tTo have these three classics for this low price is fantastic. One film is the 1938 version of the classic Christmas Carol this one starring Reginald Owen as a very respectable Scrooge. If you can refrain from comparing him to Alastair Sim, you will be better able to enjoy another interpretation of Scrooge, and it is a fine one. Owen is truly miserly and wretched, as befits Scrooge, and very believable. The overall production is wonderful, the only drawback was the casting of Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim...WAY over the top, to the point where he is annoying. But all in all, a great version, and Ann Rutherford as the Ghost of Christmas Past is fascinating.\nChristmas in Connecticut is very satisfying; a real new England Christmas, with Barbara Stanwyck in one of her lighter roles. This is enjoyable for those who are alone over the Holidays and a great film to watch with family for those who will have a traditional Holiday, with family and friends.\nI saved the best for last...Boys Town.\nThis is absolutely one of my all-time favorites, with Mickey Rooney in one of his definitve, cocky wise-guy roles. No one could touch a Mickey Rooney performance in this type of role; he cornered the brash market...as he proves in this movie. It is a real treat to watch him interact with Spencer Tracy, THE finest actor Hollywood has ever produced, IMO. He has dignity, he commands respect simply by virtue of his own quiet, firm presence.\nThe other boys were great complements to the production; all very natural, and Bobs Watson particularly heart-breaking in his role; what a great actor he was! (If you can find a copy, see him with Cedric Hardwicke and Lionel Barrymore in "On Borrowed Time", a REAL tear-jerker.)\nI wish I could have been on the set of this one! They must have had a ball. When I saw it, as a child, I thought it was a movie, therefore fantasy, and not real; when I found out that Father Flanagan was indeed real, as was Boys Town, it gave the movie even more of a dimension and interest. His tenet, "There is no such thing as a bad boy", is touching in its simplicity and pure, simple faith. Father Flanagan\'s secret for success with even the most recalcitrant youth was this faith and his refusal to accept any boy\'s lack of self-esteem or belief in himself; with FF ALL things were possible.\nWhen Spencer Tracy was voted best Actor at the Academy Awards that year, he became the first actor to win the award two years in a row...the first was for his part as Manuel, in "Captains Courageous." Being the gracious, wonderful man he was, he accepted his award with extreme humility, and gave it to Father Flanagan, whom he highlighted in his acceptance speech.\nThis movie has drama, excitement and some very funny moments and shows the amazing versatility of a very young Mickey Rooney. A truly great buy\n'

aS'\tWhen old-fashioned lessons came in sweet packages!\n \tI first saw this as a child during an "afternoon movie" event at my gradeschool.  Little did I understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting, nor did I appreciate the subtle moral of the film, namely that good guys sometimes do finish first, by the very nature of their untainted goodness.\n\nOh, sure, I rooted for Charlie and his uncle, the poorest of the poor, simply trying to make ends meet.  And who didn\'t despise Veruca Salt, the bratty English tart--with a pushover for a father--who acted like the world was her private oyster?\n\nBut having recently purchased and viewed this movie on DVD with my wife and little daughter, I was dazzled at how magical the Chocolate Factory still is, even in our age of CG film wizardry.  And without having seen the new version, I can\'t help but think that even the versatile Johnny Depp is not up to the task of leaping Gene Wilder\'s timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon, Willy Wonka.\n\nMore impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward, old-fashioned morality tales with universal appeal.  Several deadly sins are on display throughout this film, including gluttony, vanity, greed, and avarice; and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike.\n\nThe lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated, and I have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film, or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the 21st century postmodernism that Hollywood has embraced?\n\nI\'ll have to check it out.  Meanwhile, see the classic, and be charmed all over again\n'

If you do, within the first 10 minutes, you will pause it, and have to run out for chinese food instantly and not the quick take out junk either, but the honest to god traditional chinese cuisine that the father makes. I adore this movie, It is a heartwarming, hilarious story about a Widower Retired Master Chef and his Three very different daughters. Ang Lee gives us insight into this family from the perspective of how love and life and humanity can be compared to eating and drinking. The soundtrack is amazing, the scenery is magnificent and the realness of it all transport you in, so that you can almost smell the food cooking. I would have killed to be on that set to just sample all those dishes!\n'

aS"\tRealistic, Yet Hopeless War Story.\n \tBased upon director and writer Oliver Stone's own experiences in Vietnam, PLATOON was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict.  The movie revolves around a young American soldier, Pvt. Chris Taylor (a young Charlie Sheen) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty.  The battle sequences are very gritty, graphic, and realistic.  Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe), but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger). Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews.  Grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict, while Barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war.  At its core then, PLATOON is a movie about the internal war for one soldier's soul between good and evil.  Though Stone based the film upon his own experiences, there are scenes that have been embellished and the view Stone presents is only one view of the war--see the film WE WERE SOLDIERS for the opposite view as presented by Stone in PLATOON.\n\nDespite the negative outlook upon life, the military, and the Vietnam War, PLATOON is probably Oliver Stone's best movie to date.  Stone's direction of the film is brilliant from the two-week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming, to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes, to filming in sequence, to recognizing the talent of Johnny Depp, Stone illustrated in PLATOON was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with.  The film contains fine performances: Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, Charlie Sheen, Forest Whitaker, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, and Johnny Depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity, despite the deep metaphysical connotations.  PLATOON won the 1986 Oscar for Best Picture, Stone won the Best Director Oscar, and also received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nI was surprised and found that I enjoyed PLATOON, though there were several parts of the film that I found myself aghast.  I've never been in battle myself, but I do know that war is hell.  Nevertheless, I cannot bring myself to agree with the film's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one's soul to evil.  Despite this, there are many positive things within the movie.  This is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well (though they might prefer something more hopeful such as SAVING PRIVATER RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS)\n"

aS"\tThe basic techniques\n \tThis DVD contains the basic techniques of Krav maga system. The techniques include attacks with hands (mostly punches with closed fist, but also hammer punches), elbows, knees and feet. There are some counterattacks and defences also included. At the beginning of the film they talk about angles of attack, target areas and stance  and  movement. As a DVD extra, they present focus mitt combinations to utilize in your training (they mention that they will produce an entire film on the subject in the future).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that they don't teach, or even mention the correct falling technique at all. Also, I think they should have taught also palm strikes, but for some reason they were left out. As palm strike is almost as effective as punch with a closed fist, but much more safe for your own hand, it should be included in everyones' arsenal. When instructing kicking techniques, they mention casually that you can kick also to the head. I think that they should have warned against that, because in real life, kicking above your own waist is considered risky, and generally not advisable.\n\nThe presentation of techniques varies from fair to excellent, the average being of good quality. In some techniques I learned some nuances I had not grasped in my Krav maga classes. Each technique opens up with a dramatized scene in which the technique is used. After that they present the technique at full speed, and after that in slow motion, and finally in learning stages. For some reason, they have chosen not to use slow motion of a full speed presentation of technique. Rather, the person presenting the technique is moving in slow motion, according to the instructions of off-screen narrator. This makes somewhat amateurish impression of the production.\n\nSpeaking of production, it is fairly OK. The film is shot with only one camera, but for the most part, it is shooting at the right spot. The techniques are presented in a studio against a black screen, but the dramatized scenes are shot in loading docks, restaurants, parking lots and so on. They use two narrators who take turns with narrating the techniques. The other narrator is International Krav maga federation head instructor Eyal Yanilov, and the other is U.S. chief instructor Darren Levine. Yanilov does not speak very good English, so from time to time it is hard to grasp what he is saying. Otherwise the production is good, and it's easy to understand the techniques.\n\nAs a Krav maga practitioner myself, I like the system. In this film, they have succeeded in presenting the basic techniques very well. There are some shortcomings, though, that reduce one star from the rating of this film. \n\nRun time: 1:2\n"

aS'\tFun decade\n \tCapsule reviewer Sam Graham (above) is one king-sized jerk! Tears For Fears and Swing Out Sister are two of the best acts that came out of the \'80s and they are still going strong today! The videos on this collection are some of the most obvious, but enjoyable nevertheless. It would be nice if Amazon would hire somebody  to write for them who at least had a little common sense when it comes to music, instead of some supposedly "hip" idiot\n'

aS"\tUps and Downs--War  and  Remembrance miniseries from 1988\n \tI did not see this series when it originally aired in the late 80's.  I had seen Winds of War, however, and -- at that time, I loved it.  Now, when I purchased the DVD's, both series seem somewhat dated and the acting stilted at times to the point of being a distraction.  I particularly have trouble with accepting Robert Mitchum as a virile, intelligent, sombre, alert and perceptive, about 50-something Pug Henry.  I wish some filmmaker (Curtis would be great!) would do a REMAKE of this entire project -- making it into a 4 hour feature movie -- tightening up the script entirely (apologies to Mr. Wouk who wrote the teleplay) -- mostly keep in the historical scenes--but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea-- and do away with some of the long, soap opera dialogue scenes.  Keep the Holocaust part intact --these were the MOST powerful Holocaust scenes I've EVER seen and I've seen most of them; but have someone like Kevin Costner be Pug Henry (or Harrison Ford).  And find a truly young, very vibrant Natalie (an actress who has a commanding yet somehow innocent presence), and a gorgeous, rather naive rebel leading man to play Byron (Briney).  We need to feel their chemistry -- otherwise, what transpires (Briney's desperate attempts to find Natalie and his son) seem over-wrought and contrives.I LOVED Polly Bergen as Rhoda -- it might be hard to find anyone better, I think.  And you'd need a new Hitler -- one who is more like the actor who played him in Winds of War\n"

aS"\tThe Point is excellent video\n \tThis wonderful TV special from the 70's is timeless and has great music by Harry Nihlssen (not sure of that spelling).  The lesson is all about tolerance with lots of side issues of great value.  I am thrilled to own this DVD.  It brought back all kinds of memories for me - both the story AND especially the music. It is a perfect addition to my collection of movies for my grandchildren\n"

aS'\tLove, Death and Genes: A Sociobiological Prespective\n \tFrom the Sociobiological aspect the movie conveys brilliantly how the husband that doesn\'t has access to its genetic children will resort to extreme violence. It also shows how parents are excited about courtship abilities of their young son (since a "Don-Juan" son can pass a lot of their genes with various women in his lifetime) . Eventually it shows how the aging parents cannot bare the pain from losing their only son, the only way by which they can pass their genes, so they resort to extreme violence, even if the  violence is somewhat spiteful: "If my son cannot pass my genes, your son who killed my son for a good genetic reason wouldn\'t be able to either" - that\'s the subconscious motivation for murder "conveyed" by the genes\n'

aS'\tGood Material, Poorly Put Together\n \tWhen I first found the Broadway Lost Treasure Serier on Amazon, I nearly jumped up and down in my seat. Any Broadway clips that I can get a hold of I definitly must get. I bought Broadway Lost Treasure I and Broadway Lost Treasures II together. I must say the performances were very good, just because you can\'t call broadway bad. The way the performances were put together, however, was boring and gave off cheaply made vibes. Dont get me wrong the hosts were fantastic(Jerry Orbach,Angela Lansbery.etc)some of my favorite people, but I wanted I little bit more background information on the shows and things like that.\n\nOverall, I encourage purchasing Broadway Lost Treasures II(and the first one),if you keep an open mind. If you dont know alot about broadway, then this will bore you to tears. This is not what you should purchase if you want to learn more about broadway. If you are more interested in learning more about broadway, rather than just seeing performances, then I would buy "Broadway: The American Musical" (which can be found on Amazon).\n'

aS'\tBetter than any other baby video\n \tThese are the best dvds out there for babies because they are full of live action animals, people, flowers, water, etc.  I got them for my daughter when she was about 3 months old - she loved them then and she still loves them at 6 months.  They are perfect for the car for long trips to visit grandparents, and for afternoons when I need a break to cook dinner.  She laughs at the kids on the video and loves the animals, too.  The best part of course is the Christian music!  These videos are top quality and my daughter loves them - she gets bored very quickly with Baby Einstein.\n'

aS'\tUnder rated "sort of" buddy movie.\n \tPeirce really suprised me in this movie.  He was always so "pretty" in his movies, he showed that he can play "dirty".  An unlikely "friendship" developes between a regular guy and a hired killer.  Pierce, the hired killer, is getting older and less steady on the trigger, could it be that years of murdering is weighing heavy on his concience, or that he is close to his retirement years and dosen\'t have a  real friend in this whole stinkin\' world because of the business he\'s in.  Either way, he\'s like a man in a desert who forgot to bring water.  Unusual buddy film, but, it works!  Enjoy\n'

aS"\tMoving and influential\n \tI first saw this movie in high school in the theater.  I was extremely moved by the film, and it triggered a facination with South Asia that lasts to this day - I even work half the year in Sri Lanka now.  So for me, personally, this movie is of tremendous influence.\n\nI understand the arguements about the crediting of non-white actors; I always wondered why Candice Bergman is given top billing, given that she only appears in a very few scenes.  Well, that's the way of the world - it's marketing right or wrong, and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known.  It's not right, but that's Hollywood. I mean, better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all, yes?\n\nAnd you've got to admit, it was quite a debut for Ben Kingsly. Wow.  He'll be forever known for this role.\n\nThat aside, this is an excellent, amazing film.  Of course, it's still highly relevant, perhaps even more so in our post-911 world of fear.  \n\nThe movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration.  A must-see for anyone who feels anger, fear, agressively nationalistic, hopelessness, hatred, or lost.  I can think of several politicans who need to see this movie\n"

aS"\tGREAT MAFIA MOVIE\n \tThis movie is a great movie to add to your DVD collection.  Especially if you are a mob fan.  This movie is about corruption within the mob, about betrayal, about death and dying.  It starts off with someone trying to whack the don, and the family trying to find out who it is and why.  I'm not going to ruin it for anyone by telling the story.  Just watch it.  Mario Puzo's The Last Don (1997) was great too\n"

aS'\tExcellent Guide\n \tI ordered this guide so that I could understand all of the options and functions available on my new Nikon D200.  Since it is a video that I could watch, pause, then continue watching it was easy for me to understand. The explanations made a lot of sense.  There are lots of examples and exercises that help to explain not only how the D200 works but how to use the various functions to take better photos. I highly reccommend it\n'

aS'\tWithout a doubt, the definitive version of Blade Runner.\n \tWhile I\'ve always loved Blade Runner, the so-called "Theatrical Cut" was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation.  Harrison Ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped.  But Hollywood, in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience\'s intelligence and artistic sensitivity, stuck with it anyway, on the assumption that we needed to be spoon-fed with sophomoric incompetence.\n\nEqually stupid, though less damaging in that its effect was more restricted, was the inappropriate sappy ending, which not only contradicted the entire thematic essence of the film but its visual essence as well.  It didn\'t even make any sense: the earth was supposed to be ravaged by wars.  But Hollywood, with characteristic cowardice, trembled in fear at the thought of actually challenging an audience.  Rick Deckard\'s fate at the end of the Director\'s Cut is far more memorable than the nonsense inflicted on theater viewers in 1982, and the subsequent VHS audience.  It reminds me of what Orion Pictures did to George Romero\'s Monkeyshines. (Since when does a Romero film end with two people grinning at each other like lovesick idiots?)  Or how about the "happy ending" grotesquely grafted onto Terry Gilliam\'s Brazil?\n\nThe extra footage between Deckard and Rachael, while not extensive, enriches the characterizations, however modestly, and the brief dream sequence pays off by the end.  The only thing I regret is that the extra bloody footage - in the eye gouging and hand impaling scenes - found on the old VHS tape was not included in the Director\'s Cut.  Which means that this is not fully the Director\'s Cut: the material was left out to garner the sacred, almighty "R" rating upon the film\'s re-release, as it was the first time around.  One would think it would have been restored on DVD, but Warner, with their predictable spinelessness and artistic ineptitude, decided against it.  They probably rationalized it by saying to themselves that Ridley Scott would have wanted it that way.  Can anyone say "Eyes Wide Shut"?\n\nThe fact that there are viewers course enough to value the "theatrical cut" and loathe the improved and definitive edit of the film may only go to show that Hollywood may not be underestimating their intelligence and artistic sensitivity after all.   And "definitive" the Director\'s Cut is: despite the one hesitation over the missing bloody footage, there is no doubt that this is the only version of the film that should ever be viewed again, by anyone.\n'

aS"\tFantastic Workout\n \tI love this video.  I get up before anyone else so that I can do this video and sometimes the meditation at the end runs a little long.  It's a fantastic meditation, though, that centers me for the entire day.  Ravi Singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear.  Ana Brett does the poses very clearly, and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses.  I have already recommended this video to friends\n"

aS'\tthe white warrior\n \tKickboxer came out a year after the highly popular "Bloodsport" and like Bloodsport, Kickboxer is no doubt a "Van Damme classic".  There are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences, however the acting suffers - worse than Bloodsport in that department.  As for the plot - revenge - go figure.  But we don\'t need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie.  Hey, it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action.  Fortunately, Kickboxer delivers it well.  The movie begins with a couple of good fights right away.  About 1/2 of the movie is training sequences, but many are enjoyable to watch.  The final fight is between the villain, Tong Po (played by Michel Qissi) and Kurt Sloane (Van Damme).  Its a rather lenghty fight, about 10 minutes, which is nice.  Above all else, they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on, and yes the result is some blood during the fighting.  Kickboxer is the only martial art movie I know of that used this "ancient Thai style of fighting" (with the exception of Kickboxer 2 and a small scene in Ring of Fire).  I really enjoyed this.  I also enjoyed Michel Qissi.  He had maybe one line in the movie, but still succeeded in making Tong Po a great villain, who also will return in the sequal.  Lastly, we can\'t forget to mention the Van Damme dance - Napoleon Dynamite would be proud.  Also keep an eye out for Ong Soon Han (main villain in both Bloodsport 2 and Dragon:The Bruce Lee Story), who has a short fight against Tong Po about 1/2 way through the movie\n'

aS"\tVisually Stunning\n \tI have trouble saying how much I enjoyed this movie.  The plot was well worn, but it didn't feel staid or plodding.  Visually, the movie is simply stunning.  Absolutely some of the best visuals I have seen in years.  The Jim Henson company outdid themselves this time\n"

aS"\tthe best just got better\n \tThis, as you may have already read, was a very intimate little show made to promote Morning View. The live footage is as good as it gets, and the sound is flawless to boot. This DVD really gives you a good idea at how amazing Incubus is live. Most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers. Every song is a favorite of mine, and I absolutely love the way Brandon mixed things up on Pardon Me. Plus the little comments Brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch. I still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that I never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet. The bonus features are splendid as well. If you watched everything this DVD has to offer it would take up about 1/2 of your day probably, there's that much on here. Just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs, Brandon recording Warning (a lot of this song is a capella), and Incubus showing how funny they really are. The original cut of the Wish You Were Here video is also on this, which is pretty humerous.\n\nA few of the best songs on here are Pardon Me, The Warmth, Warning, New Skin, and Nice To Know You. As amazing and funny as the special features are, the standout is really the performance. I can't find any words that would do this show justice. I guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself\n"

aS"\tHorror In The Sky\n \tI remember seeing this film when I was 7 or 8 years old and it scared me senseless.  Seeing people getting their heads chopped off and mutalated from who knows what that flies around a big city gave me an uneasy eerie feeling.  I didn't know what the name of this movie was and I was looking for it in the video stores.  I stumbled onto this accidentally and taking my chances of this being the dragon in the sky killing people movie that I saw 20 years ago, I bought it. After seeing it again, this is the movie that scared me to death so many years ago.  Though, by today's standards, this movie is rather cheap and cheesy, it still gave me that uneasy eerie feeling.  This movie is original, having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings, that eats people like birds eat worms.  This movie is a hybrid of Godzilla and slasher flicks.  This is definately B-movie material, but it's fun to watch and brings back some childhood memories... and that is worth more than the price of admission\n"

aS'\tBetter Than Most Bio-Pics\n \tTim Burton\'s "Ed Wood," a surreal bio-pic is one of the most entertaining, inspiring, and funny bio-pics I\'ve seen. No wonder really since it\'s directed by one of the best directors around and written by two of the best bio-pic writers Scott Alexander  and  Larry Karaszewski (who, after this film, would pen the Larry Flynt bio-pic "The People Vs. Larry Flynt" and the Andy Kaufman bio-pic "Man on the Moon"). It\'s also got an amazing cast of actors, including Oscar nominee Johnny Depp (Best Actor, \'Finding Neverland\'), Oscar winner Martin Landau (Best Supporting Actor, \'Ed Wood\'), Sarah Jessica Parker (\'Failure to Launch\'), Patricia Arquette (\'True Romance\'), Jeffrey Jones (\'Deadwood\'), and Oscar nominee Bill Murray\n(Best Actor, \'Lost in Translation\'). Depp plays Edward D. Wood Jr., an aspiring filmmaker who\'s down on his luck and lives with his girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Parker). After hearing about a film being made about a transsexual, without a script, Ed pens a script called "Glen or Glenda."\nThe movie is kind of close to Ed\'s heart, because Ed likes to dress in woman\'s clothes. But he\'s not gay. While walking past a shop that sells coffins Ed meets the actor Bela Lugosi (Landau), who played Dracula in the classic Universal film and recruits him to star in the Glen or Glenda film. The movie immediately bombs and is called one of the worst films ever made. Not letting it get him down, Ed goes to work on his next film "Bride of the Atom." After a few more films and meeting a few new people, including wrestler Tor Johnson (George "The Animal" Steele), TV personality Vampira (Lisa Marie), and psychic Criswell (Jones); Ed goes on to make his masterpiece "Plan 9 From Outer Space." The latter is the only film I\'ve ever seen by Ed Wood. While the movie has been called the worst film ever made, it wasn\'t bad. It\'s campy and stupid; You can definitely see why it would be considered bad back then, but it was entertaining and fun to watch. Ed Wood was an interesting, and quirky, guy...Which Tim Burton makes perfectly clear here and Depp does a great job bringing Wood to life. Martin Landau gives his finest performance as Bela Lugosi, he disappears behind the persona. He looks and sounds like Lugosi. Another thing I liked about the film was that it shows us the bright time in Ed Wood\'s life, through his first film to his "masterpiece." We hear the downside of his life through the epilogue. This movie is, in the end, a loving tribute to "B" movies that is over-the-top yet perfect. As I said, the movie is very funny. Especially, Landau who gets some of the best lines as Lugosi. Bill Murray co-stars as Ed\'s transsexual friend Bunny.\n\nGRADE: A-\n'

aS"\tHas any couple ever sizzled like Harlow  vs Gable?\n \tI don't think so, be it in the jungle, a New York high rise or at sea. Hepburn  and  Tracy were great, no argument. But they were so modern  and  urbane, not rowdy  and  sexy, always fighting like Harlow  and  Gable. China Seas is a fine example of this chemistry.  Yeah,  and  its a pretty good story too. Gable is Capt. Gaskell, skipper of a passenger/merchant ship running from Hong Kong to Singapore. Harlow is the floozie, Dolly, he had a fling with on shore. The ship is carrying gold. There is a terrific typhoon,  and  a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while. They torture the Captain, but he doesn't reveal where the gold is. Dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman, Wallace  Berry, against the Captain because she is mad at him. She of course changes her mind. The Captain is trying to ditch Dolly  and  thinks he's meant for Lady Sybil, played by Rosalind Russell, an old flame. But he  and  Dolly really are in love. Unfortunately the collaborations between Harlow  and  Gable was cut short at five movies with Harlow untimely  and  early death several years later.\n"

aS'\tHeartwarming, good for all ages\n \tI remember watching Anne of Green Gables when I was a little girl with my sister, over and over again. Laughing everytime Anne broke her slate on Gilberts head, or when she accidently dyed her hair green, or when she waxes poetic about her "bosom friend". It made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old. I would recommend this movie for anyone young or old. It is a beautiful heartwarming movie, with gorgeous scenery, unforgettable characters, and plenty of moments to laugh and cry\n'

aS"\tA Funny Family Comedy: Guerilla's, Not Gorilla's!\n \tThis comedy starring (Martin Short), and (Kurt Russell) is pretty funny. When I first watched it, I wasn't really impressed with it, but now I find it pretty funny. I think that (Kurt Russell), as Captain Ron was pretty funny. However, it was the antics of (Martin Short), who hires Captain Ron to sail his ship in the Caribbean, that was the funniest character in the film. The story begins when a relative of (Short) dies, leaving him a ship, which is moored at a small Caribbean island. The wife (Mary Kay Place) who is not too pleased at going to the island, decides to go along with this mid-life crises of (Short); on condition that an experienced sailsman help them with the boat.\n\nEnter Captain Ron (Kurt Russell). He is a very strange and quirky fellow, to the uptight and anxious (Martin Short). However, since (Short) knows nearly nothing about boating, he decides to hire Captain Ron on the suggestion and recommendation of the man who is interested in buying the boat. Therefore, Captain Ron, who is not very bright to begin with, leads the family [including Short's two children] on a cruise through the Caribbean: And he is a very eccentric character. Harmless, but funny. What ensues is a funny interaction between (Short) and (Russell) on their voyage. Including a scene where (Russell) warns (Short) not to stray from one particular islands path, due to Guerilla's on the island. Which (Short) interpets as Gorilla's. A very funny scene. Recommended, it is a family watch that your children can enjoy\n"

On 33 1/3 LP\'s, that is!\n\nL.V. Hoff, played specactularly by Absolutely Fabulous\' Miss Jane Horrocks, is a timid, shy, mousy young girl who cloisters herself in her bedroom day after day and plays her dear, dead father\'s record collection over and over again.  You see, L.V. and her boisterous, overbearing, abusive pig of a mother, Mari played wonderfully by the great Brenda Blethyn live above the family business, Hoff Records.\n\nEnter telephone men George and Billy, (Philip Jackson  and  Ewan McGregor). They install Mari\'s first phone in the Hoff\'s small flat.  Billy is a backward chap himself with only his homing pigeons as friends but once he meets L.V., he is smitten and so is she.\n\nMari, always on the lookout for a new beau, finds one in talent producer, Ray Say, played by a great Michael Caine.  So great, in fact that Michael was nominated for an Oscar for his performance of the producer/womanizer/lothario Mr. Ray Say. After Ray hears L.V. singing in her upstairs bedroom he knows he has found a star and pawns everything he owns to make money and exploit L.V.\'s singing talent.\n\nL.V. debuts at Mr. Boo\'s (Jim Broadbent) variety club but gets a terrible case of stage fright and ends up being "booed" off the stage.\n\nOf course, Ray wants L.V. to try again so under the influence of Ray, Mari and her friend Sadie, played by Annette Badland, L.V. agrees to do one more show.  L.V. is a HIT with her impersonations of all her and her father\'s favorite singers and actors. Ray makes a BOATLOAD of money, wants L.V. to come away with him, Mari gets jealous and lots of other crazy things happen with a shocker of an ending that you won\'t forget!\n\nThis movie was adapted from the stage play of the same name that was written especially for Jane Horrocks in mind as Little Voice.   I don\'t understand how Miss Horrocks was passed over for an Oscar nomination herself.  She is splendid in this film as is the whole cast of characters.\n\nHighly Recommended and Happy Watching!\n'

aS'\tYundi Li has always interpreted music in a most natural way\n \tI have heard both Arrau and Richter playing Liszt\'s B Minor Sonata and I am afraid I very much prefer the way Yundi Li had played this piece. Perhaps it is not fair to compare their techniques as Arrau\'s technique was always not that impressive.\n\nYundi Li is not just a virtuoso. You are impressed not only by the shattering way he played for the more emotional part of this piece ( when Liszt was supposed to struggle with his other side of character), you will also be impressed by his every subtle nuance for the lyrical part of the music which you seldom hear from others. You will also appreciate all the smooth transitions he made from one theme to another. Will I be able to hear a better and a more logical Liszt\'s B Minor Sonata than this?\n\nI believe Yundi Li is capable of very deep feeling when he plays. You seldom find one pianist more deeply immersed in the music during performance than Yundi Li . Music just flow out from his fingers in a most natural way as a result of such deep feeling. I particularly agree with this description of Yundi Li:\n\n"What distinguishes this uniquely gifted young artist from most of his contemporaries is his ability to put his personal stamp on a work without resorting, even for a single gesture, to eccentricity."\n\nAlthough Richter was technically more capable compared with Arrau, I have always found him not expressive enough for pieces that require more rubati. You will be impressed by his technique for some Beethoven Sonata.\n'

aS'\tCol. Kurtz IF he had survived "Apocalypse Now"\n \tEver wonder where Col. Kurtz would\'ve ended up if he had survived the end of "Apocalypse Now"? Well, now we know: He exiled himself to a deserted island to create humanimals -- the horror, the horror.\n\nIn light of all the bad press one would really think this is a lousy movie. And I can see WHY some people don\'t like it, the main portion of the flick is really INSANE. However, if you\'re a sucker for lost-on-an-island type yarns and appreciate the heavy mood  and  insanity of "Apocalypse Now," you\'ll probably like it. I\'m not saying it\'s anywhere near as great as "Apocalypse Now" but Marlon Brando and the jungle insanity make the comparison inevitable. \n\nWHAT WORKS: The title sequence is great, perhaps one of the best in all of cinema (another Amazon reviewer noted this, so I\'m not alone); the soundtrack is phenomenal (\'nuff said); the plot is intriguing; the humanimal make-up is fine (\'Hyena\' looks especially horrific); the film possesses an undeniable creative pizzazz (i.e. it\'s moody, atmospheric and insane); and Marlon Brando\'s 35 minute stint in the film is as captivating as always (you can probably tell I\'m a huge Brando fan -- in particular, "One-Eyed Jacks," "Mutiny on the Bounty" (1962), "The Young Lions," "Superman" and "Apocalypse Now" [not "Redux"]). \n\nWHAT DOESN\'T WORK: The third act of the film is almost total insanity, except for the final ten minutes or so; as a result the story will lose the interest of those who have no appreciation for such artistic flair.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHTS: I really enjoyed seeing Brando in his old age in this flick; it proves he had his magnetic charm until the end. If you enjoyed Brando as \'Kurtz\' in "Apocalypse Now" you\'ll appeciate him in "Island;" in fact, as already noted, Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz in his old age (i.e. nutjob in the jungle).\n\nIf you\'re predisposed for such a flick, "Dr. Moreau" is weird, but certainly worthwhile.\n'

aS'\tHilariously Mean Spirited!\n \tOkay, how many of you liked cheerleaders in your school or anybody who tried out for pageants?  Unless you were one of the misery causing bee-otches, you didn\'t.  This movie not only effectively makes fun of the way girls treat each other in the pageant arena, but takes a good crackshot at the mothers (Kirstie Alley\'s character is a real gem!).  It also makes fun of the people in Minnesota.  I see lots of reviewers from that state whining about this film, but heard the term "midwest" used far more often.  We feel your pain, but I would have laughed had they picked my state (which is very close to MN).  They poke fun at hunters, Lutherans (yes, I\'m one), and lutefisk for lunch in high school (I\'m also of Norwegian decent).  \n\nThe most fun to be had is the way this movie spoofs how nasty women can be regardless of class warfare, and what lengths some of them will go to just to get their way.  Funny and dead-on like the nailhead beneath a hammer, this movie is a nasty and fun treat for everyone who has ever been treated badly by the so-called local uppercrust.  Enjoy 100 minutes of vengeance, and then go out into the world feeling better about the fact that you\'re definitely not alone!\n'

aS"\tfun and quick workout\n \tI have both Madonna Grimes workouts DVD's and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts.  It was a great way to start my day, I was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same, but with disapointment comes satisfaction.  The other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts, and learn a workout that I never thought that I would learn and enjoy doing.  Jayna's bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning,  also great moves you can use for other reasons.    Rania's upper body is really fun, some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot.  Suhaila workout I am intimidated by. I have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it.  I have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks.  She can contract them one at a time.  Some mornings I get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape. They are really fun. This tape has a bonus YOGA, I had never tried YOGA and this gave me an opportunity to try it.  \nI highly recommeded this DVD/VHS. I love the 10 minute workouts.  With this DVD/VHS there are no excuses you can always find 10 minutes in a day.\n"

aS'\tKurosawa and Mifune\'s Final Masterpiece\n \tThis movie is a real departure for the director, Akira Kurosawa, in that it blends his humanistic inspirational-type movies, like "Ikiru" with a bit of action and drama "Yojimbo, Sanjuro."  The majority of the movie follows a young and arrogant doctor forced to work in a rural and poor region of Japan under a domineering senior doctor.  Naturally, everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour.  Midway through the movie, out of nowhere, one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission.  It is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief, confusing, and brutal.  Toshiro Mifune and Kurosawa never worked together again after this movie and the director\'s work changed radically.  Still good, but I\'ll always prefer the b and w epics the two of them made together.\n'

aS'\tSurprising. . .\n \tI bought this only because i loved the first one, hoping it wasn\'t as terrible as the second. After i watched it i was so impressed. First of all i loved that it really didn\'t have anything to do with the first, aside from Cassidy being Katherine\'s cousin,and sharing the same last name (there is only one reference to Katherine and Sebastian in the beginning). It is much better than having different actors playing old characters, which drags a movie down alot. I thought the story was great,  with good twists.The whole cast is very attractive, which can\'t hurt either. The "bad" characters are all pretty likeable, aside from one, and all is well in the end. The best thing about this movie is the character Cassidy. I sarted out hating her, and ended up really liking her for her realness, and honesty she does not try to hide that she is a b*tch.  This actress does a particularly good job, pulling off both loveable, and complete brat at the same time.  I would definetly reccomend this movie.\n'

aS"\ta true classic\n \tI can't believe anyone would give this wonderful movie less than 5 stars.  I don't know what the deal is with the sudden burst of negative reviews, but this is certainly NOT a bad movie.  I was in 7th grade when it came out and I remember how popular it was back then.  Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE loved it.  No one said they didn't like it.  Even my dad to this day says he wouldn't mind watching the movie a few more times, and he NEVER wants to watch a movie more than two times.  \n\nThe actors, the direction, the story EVERYTHING about this movie worked.  It's a movie that will remain a classic forever.  There's something here for everyone.\n"

aS'\tA WINNING ELECTION\n \tRarely has a film captured the essence of adolescence, teenage angst, sexual confusion and school politics as richly as this marvelous movie from Alexander Payne.  Reese Witherspoon breaks out with a performance of incredible range and emotional complexity and established herself as an actress of great range.  Matthew Broderick gives perhaps his most richly realized performance as the straightlaced teacher with his own sexual drives and confusion over his feelings for Witherspoon\'s often times obnoxious but undeniably strong personality.  In his screen debut, Chris Klein brings a rare depth and humor to the cliched role of the school jock coerced into running against Witherspoon, and Jessica Campbell is great as his sexually confused sister whose honest campaign excites the students and astonishes the faculty.  One of the most painfully honest and funny sequences involves the prayers of the candidates on the night before the election.  Reese prays to an unfamiliar God and beseeches him to let her win so she "can carry out his divine plan."  Campbell prays that she finds a lesbian lover at the Catholic all girls school she deliberately caused her parents to send her to, while goofy Klein shows the most depth by thanking God for all of his blessings (especially his large penis) and telling God he knows the best candidate will win.  \nELECTION is a very entertaining look at teenagers and one of the best of its kind.  Enjoy\n'

aS"\tA short workout that packs a punch and will whip you up to shape\n \tA short workout that packs a punch and will whip you up in shape!\nIf you like endurance weight training with short cardio bursts then you will enjoy these workouts! I have all 4 of Jillian's endurance strength training DVDS and they are very good especially when combined with 30-45 mins. cardio. The Maximize Full Frontal DVD is a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Front DVD; it has more core work, more one-leg moves and the cardio segments always use dumbbells. The Maximize Back In Action DVD is also a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Backside DVD; it has more core work, harder exercises and additional power moves. All 4 DVDs are an excellent buy and since they are all short workouts, you can easily combine them with cardio for a well-rounded 60 minute workout. Note: You will not like Jillian's workouts if you prefer to go heavy with weights.\n"

aS'\tI Thought It Was Brilliant\n \t"Cinderella II: Dreams Come True" is a series of three stories featuring mostly characters from the original Cinderella and a few new ones. The animation is amazing --- it\'s filled with lush color (except for muted color when the story calls for it) and the animation looks very polished. It\'s really a sight to see.\n\nThe three stories in this are called, according to the closing credits --- "Aim To Please," "Tall Tail" and "An Uncommon Romance." These stories are all tied together with the idea that the Fairy Godmother is helping the mice to make a storybook about the adventures of them and Cinderella since the time that Cinderella met the Prince. The very first story finds Cinderella arriving at the castle after her honeymoon. The Prince is forced to rush away on important state business and Cinderella is left in charge of the royal banquet/ball. She has no idea what she\'s supposed to do and so this woman named Prudence is assigned to help her out. But will Cinderella be able to pull this together in time and in a way that will please the King?\n\nThe second story, "A Tall Tail" finds Cinderella in preparation for the Spring Festival. Jaq wants to help out, but it seems like Cinderella no longer has any time for him. He makes a wish to become human.\n\nThe final story contains the surprising premise that Cinderella\'s stepsister Anastasia is falling in love with a breadmaker at market. The Evil Stepmother forbids this romance, but Cinderella decides to show Anastasia that even she can have a dream come true.\n\n\nThe voice talent is amazing. They did a great job of casting people who made the voices sound just like the original film. Unless you\'re really listening hard, you\'ll be hard-put to notice any difference at all.\n\nThe music in this film is a combination of themes from the original and a few new songs performed by Brooke Allison. I\'d never heard anything by Brooke Allison before (that I know of), but she\'s an amazing artist. Perhaps the most surprising piece is the closing credits number (also featured as a music video) --- a techno version of "Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo" called "Put it Together." It works quite well. Another great song is "Follow Your Heart."\n\n\nFor a Disney sequel, this DVD also has some nice special features. There\'s the aforementioned music video, which features entirely of clips from the film, rather than the recording session by Brooke Allison. However, you do get to see some of the recording in the Musical Magical Featurette, which also includes an examination of the film\'s score by the composer. There\'s a Cinderella Storybook, which allows you to read a story about Jaq and Mary with or without narration. The Enchanted Castle game is fairly simple, but not too bad --- you get to help with the decoration and cleanup of Cinderella\'s castle, preparing a meal and dressing Cinderella. There\'s also a DVD-ROM game called Cinderella\'s Dollhouse. Finally, of course, this DVD has the usual previews/trailers for other movies, but perhaps not so usual. This is a great set of trailers. There\'s a promo for the "Beauty and the Beast" Special Edition DVD in which they talk about how they inserted "Human Again" into the film. Also including in this set is a neat Disney DVD "Pure Digital Magic" promo that I had never seen before.\n\nThis DVD is truly a worthy edition to the Disney Cinderella story. It really has everything you could want from a sequel to this film and doesn\'t ruin the original story in any way\n'

aS'\tOne of my favorites\n \tWhat I enjoy most about this movie, is not what I particularly enjoyed when it first came out. Being 11 when it came out, I was attracted to the urbanism of which I was not too familiar with. I didn\'t exactly grow up in the best neighborhood, but it was no Inglewood either. I think many of the younger viewers were attracted to this aspect of the film; the urban youth seeing for the first time, thier lives on a film of this caliber, and the SUBurban youth somehow glorifying this life. While I still enjoy the entire film, what I particularly enjoy now is the begining of the film. The story of a troubled young boy who while having a strong mother with her head on her shoulders, can\'t be tamed by her. She sends him to live with his father, who is in many ways her equal. But he is a man. And one of her lines in the movie is "I can\'t teach him how to be a man, that\'s your job." How true this is. Not to sound sexist, because their are millions of young boys all over the planet who are better off with just thier mother, (because of an abusive father, etc.) but you need a man to teach you to be a man. Larry Fishburne\'s charachter in this movie does this perfectly. One quote, "I know you think I\'m being hard on you Tre, but I\'m not. What I\'m trying to do is to teach you responsibility. Your friends across the street don\'t have anyone to do that, your\'e gonna see how they end up, too." I loved how this was a story about two strong and intelligent parents (while divorced) raise their son the way they know best, and not about a junkie mom and a deadbeat dad who raise a criminal. I\'d have to say that my favorite character is Furious. Yes, Reva (Tre\'s mom) played an equally strong part, but I loved how "real" Furious was. "Young" Tre I thought played an excellent part - better than Gooding Jr.? Maybe. Overall a great movie; it\'s success made it harder for corporate America to ignore the reality of inner-city youth as it exists today.\n'

aS'\tNot Just a Courtroom Drama-Micro-spective of the Human Condition..Must SEE!!\n \tThis black and white masterwork of film is a must see for all.  This is a not just a courtroom movie, but an examination of ourselves and how we see each other. Reginald Rose\'s original play reads like a powerhouse, even in a highschool english class, but given the direction of Sidney Lumet, the dynamite cast and the beautifully stark black and white cinematography it becomes a legend on film.\n\nThis movie centers on the diverse jury and it\'s deliberations in the murder trial of a young Puerto Rican man accused of killing his own father. It is an examination of our perception of one another, our selfish nature, our apathy when a crisis occurs-but does not affect us and our preconceived ideas of each other NOT based not upon fact, but upon our own experiences and traumas. It sheds light on how we process our decisions and how we can be easily yet unknowingly swayed away from the truth and yet believe we make honest and fair evaluations of fact, when in all truth we do not.\n\nThis was the ONLY film in which Henry Fonda starred AND was the producer and it was slow to take off at the box office. But within a few years this film became an american film mainstay. Regardless of the stunning performances and positive reviews, he never produced again.\n\nThis film has many of the early television and film greats and  each gives a RIVETING PERFORMANCE!!! There\'s Jack Klugman, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E.G. Marshall and Lee J. Cobb who gives one of the most memorable performances in the film. Cobb, who was known for his moving portrayal of Willie Loman in Death of a Salesman, is aggravating and compelling. Fonda depicts the "voice of reason" juror that is neither self-righteous or bleeding-heart wimpy. He challenges the other jurors and the viewer alike to rethink their conclusions and recalculate them by utilizing ALL the facts. Anyone that sees this movie will recognize at least someone they know that is like each juror, which are designated only by number throughout it\'s entirety, in their daily lives.\n\nDon\'t let the black and white format sway you, this DVD is presented in a lovely widescreen format that intensifies the expert cinematic talents of the golden age of the silver screen. This is considered an essential for anyone that loves film. My thirteen year old actually sat mesmerized through the whole film and began to watch some of my other DVDs (To Kill a Mockingbird, Inherit the Wind, Judgement At Nuremburg, to name a few) and at that tender young age, he is determined to spread the word and keep the tradition of sharing these movies of great distinction..\n\nMetaldiva Sez: This is one of the essential films you should watch and share with your friends and family.  This is an excellent price to own and to share. Get it today....\n'

aS'\tGood video, but our least favorite of the Baby Faith series\n \tWe own three Baby Faith DVD\'s.  Our favorite is "God Made Music", followed by "God Made Me".  "God Made Animals", while still a good video, is our least favorite.  For one, the animal puppets ranged somewhere between uninspiring and downright disturbing (but judge for yourself, I\'ve posted some pictures).  The frog was creepy - since when do frogs have lips?  The visuals accompanying the musical sequences seemed to be less imaginative and stimulating than the other videos too.  And the undersea clips at the end looked as old as Cousteau and were thoroughly uninteresting to my one year-old son, who is entranced by the other two videos but doesn\'t seem to care much for this one.  My suggestion...watch before you buy, if you can.  If your kid likes it, go for it.  If not, try the other videos.  You may get a different reaction\n'

aS'\tGood bye -- illusions\n \tI became interested in this movie after reading the book "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book. It was a very good movie and Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from "Ishmael" there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization. There was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization - "takers" are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don\'t know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it. Heck, the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees. But of course that was the main point of "Ishmael". If we don\'t give up being takers and go back to being part of nature, then nature has had it and so have we\n'

aS'\tLADYHAWKE and TIMELINE both produced and directed by Richard Donner. Novel by Crichton...All equal WINNER!\n \tDirector Richard Donner (LADYHAWKE, SUPERMAN, LETHAL WEAPON I, II, III, IV, etc.) leads an ensemble cast of stars Gerard Butler, Billy Connolly, Frances O\'Connor, Ethan Embry, Morton Csokas and David Thewlis "back into time only to find out that if history had not been changed by these characters the present might not exist!" (Yeah! I wrote those words! Not another critic yet it\'s a true analysis of this fantastic film!)\n   If you loved Richard Donner\'s LADYHAWKE then TIMELINE (2003) based on the novel by Michael Crichton should capture your need to escape for a good two hours entirely! Modern day archeological students go into the past by way of new age technology in order to rescue their professor. ON the way and IN the way are knights of not so good caliber, ladies in distress and one man in particular who finds himself lured to a past he never realized existed for him until he is there!\n   My rating of TIMELINE is FIVE STARS! I can sit here and give away the plot but in order for you, the viewer to truly enjoy it, I\'m not! When I saw TIMELINE for the first time it was in order to see another wonderful DONNER PRODUCTION and Billy Connolly, a Scot to whom my heart had been lost. The character of "Marek" (Gerard Butler) enslaved me upon my first sight of him! As "Creedy" in REIGN OF FIRE I\'d fallen slightly under his spell and was willing to battle with dragons that I\'d gone to cheer on in the film. "Creedy\'s" torched demise gave me cause to end their existence. "Marek" is yet another character such as LADYHAWKES "Navarre." (Rutger Hauer) For ladies who love a beleaguered knight without armor and men who like a man\'s man, "Marek" is your fellow!\n   TIMELINE is wonderful fun but enough of a twist to make you think about what actually would happen should we have the technology to "back to the future!" This is one film not only well worth the money but well worth the time to view over again and again! For ladies who despair of a real man keep this one within hand\'s grasp at a moment\'s notice! :-)\n'

The characters are so wonderfully individual, from self-absorbed Kuzko, to evil Yzma with her "secret lab", to dim witted Kronk with his shoulder angel and devil\n(Secondly, look what I can do.\nUm, I don\'t see how that...\nNo, no.

aS'\tThe Five People You Meet In Heaven\n \t"The Five People You Meet in Heaven" is a powerful book with many mixed emotions. This film was a constant mystery as I never knew what would happen next. The story is all about the people who affected Eddie the most in his life. The people he meets in Heaven are interesting and also somewhat shocking.  Some people he knew, and some he had never met. This was a great idea. \nMitch Albom kept me wanting to read as I usually am not too interested in books. This truly is the greatest book I\'ve ever read and therefore I would definitely recommend it to everyone.\n'

And the Star-Spangled Banner performance rivals Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThis is a must for any music lover, but the true Parrottheads will definitely need to add it to their collection\n'

aS'\tA Story Worth The Whole Nine Yards\n \tIf there is one war story to keep on your shelf besides "Saving Private Ryan," this is it.\n\nThe story starts with a lawyer visiting England as a tourist years after war\'s end. He discovers a cheap, ceramic antique which the store owner tells him is of little value. "Value?" replies the lawyer. "Wrap it very carefully" he adds. So begins his mental journey back in time to the English airstrip where he served as adjutant of the 918th (nine, eighteenth) Bomb Group.\n\nThis "hard luck" group is taken over by a brigadier general from a colonel who has "over-identified" with his men, thus putting them before his missions. The general, Frank Savage, must restore group discipline and performance before the group disintegrates as an effective fighting unit.\n\nGeneral Savage puts mission before men and turns the disgruntled men who despise him into a cohesive unit. They turn into a group that will do anything to keep from being left behind, or letting down their new leader. (Each announcement of a mission for the following day is characterized by the operations officer going to the mantel piece in the Officers\' Club, and turning the head of a ceramic pirate, face outward.)\n\nBut the tough general will not make the same mistake that the last group commander makes. He will always keep the mission first, and will not over-identify with his men. He will not let the loss of his men affect him. \n\nOr, will he?\n\nThis black  and  white story is exceptional and superbly acted. It shows the mental tug-of-war a leader must make in the decisions that will cost the lives of men he has come to admire and respect. It depicts how the ugliness of war brings out the best in ourselves, and creates fraternal bonds that last a lifetime.\n\nThis is not a gory story, but it is one that will leave you breathless. It may sadden you, but it will not disappoint you. It does not end with everyone living, or happy.\n\nWar never does.\n\n\n\n\nP.S. The "whole nine yards" refers to the length of ammunition linked together that fed into the machine guns aboard each bomber\n'

aS'\tTim Burton\'s at the top of his game.\n \tIt\'s interesting to read some of the other reviews. I can\'t understand how it could take a viewer two times to get through this enchanting movie. It\'s imaginative, as was "Nightmare Before Christmas", but goes beyond that movie with even better stop-action animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving. I loved "Nightmare", but Corpse Bride takes all the things I loved and made them better. The voices of all the actors ring true. The mood is gothic and yet comical. The score is rich and defines the movie perfectly. (The DVD allows you to watch the movie with only the music, and that\'s a real plus.)\n'

p336
aS"\tIts not THAT bad...\n \tOne of the most maligned movies of 2004 is...not that bad. In a fine example of how critics and Hollywood gang up on a movie before anybody has seen it, Oliver Stone delivers an epic take on the life of Alexander the Great. Not up to par with the great Hollywood epics, but not as bad as the critical cheap shots may lead you to believe.\n\nThe incredible life of Alexander the Great is epic movie material if I've ever seen any. His rise to ruler of The World by his mid twenties is chronicled here (with noticeable gaps in the timeline). His personal life is just as fascinating as his public one. His decidedly odd family life (as depicted by Stone, anyway) and his lovers (both male and female) are just as integral to the story as his military victories. Perhaps, the ultimate momma's boy just wanted to be loved.\n\nAlexander is a workable and sometimes fascinating historical epic. It certainly doesn't deserve the drubbing it got in the press. Wonderful cinematography and a fascinating subject are undermined by uneven performances and some poor storytelling decisions, but there's a lot to like. I'll take my history this way instead of as an over sentimentalized bit of claptrap like The Patriot or Pearl Harbor any day. Forget the buzz and check it out. Rent it. If, like me, you find much to enjoy there are plenty of copies on any used DVD rack. Give it a chance and make the decision for yourself. My bet is you'll find a lot to appreciate.\n"

aS'\tEnjoyable follow-up to a cult classic!\n \tAfter the original, Herbert West ( Jeffery Combs) and Dan Cain (Bruce Abbot)have returned from medical miltary duty in South America as they return back home as they have perfected their re-agent formula to continue experimentint. But Herbert however gets an idea to collect body parts especially the heart of Cain\'s old girlfriend "Meg" to create the perfect re-animated woman, however Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) has been re-animated back to life by accident as he still has powers to control zombies and want revenge for what West did to him.\n\nNot as great as the 1985 cult horror comedy masterpiece "Re-Animator" but really enjoyable! the acting is kind of average but there\'s nice splatter in this movie including a variety of odd re-animated critters like a finger creature with a human eye attached done by Screaming Mad George, David Allen (Puppet Master, Q The Winged Serpant and Young Sherlock Holmes). Like the original movie this has dark humor to propell along with gruesomeness, all in all is that it\'s not a bad follow-up but still worth watching.\n\nThis DVD is pratically bareboned with a alright transfer with no trailer! but that\'s ok, if you enjoyed the original then you\'ll probably like this one as well\n'

aS'\tAnti Americanism in British TV dramas\n \tExcellent series.  The court room scene is hilarious.  I am curious to know if anyone else has noted the subtle anti Americanism of this series (I refer to the portrayal of the American guest) as well as in Upstairs Downstairs?  In both series, as in other British TV dramas, Americans are portrayed as crude and materialistic.  What about the Henry James/Edith Wharton type aristocrats who toured England in the 19th century?  Mr. Hawksworth and others seem to have forgotten them. \n\nWhen will series 2 be released\n'

aS'\tNew Extended Cut is Worth Buying\n \tIf you\'re a fan of vampires, werewolves, action, or gothic suspense, this is probably a movie you\'d be interested in checking out. While it\'s not a groundbreaking film, it\'s a highly entertaining one, and one that, for me, is something I can rewatch several times per year.\n\nThe filming is very attractive. Everything is dark, yet not so dark you can\'t see what\'s going on. The movie has a gothic look to it - from the sets, to the costumes, to the lighting. (Please don\'t mistake the meaning of gothic in terms of entertainment as the same thing as the gothic lifestyle.) The music, mostly heavy rock, fits in well with the movie. And the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch. The movie uses several techniques made popular by "The Matrix", but who cares? It works perfectly within this movie.\n\nThe only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor...there\'s not a single joke in the entire thing! Everything is so serious and dark that unless you\'re in a pretty good mood the movie could really bring you down...that\'s how heavy it is.\n\nAs for the set. The added scenes provide more insight, and the special features are a treat, especially the 45-minute documentary "Fang vs. Fiction", which talks about vampires and werewolves. It was very intriguing.\n\nIf you\'re a fan of this movie and you own the DVD already, I would recommend selling it and buying this version, it\'s worth the money\n'

aS'\tPolice Squad - In Color (and Finally on DVD)!\n \tAs I understand it, "Police Squad" was one of the most requested titles for release on DVD.  It\'s taken a while for it to happen, but it finally has!  It\'s great to be able to replace my VHS tape that I recorded the shows on almost 20 years ago during a "Police Squad" marathon.  Having now watched the DVD, I now know that for almost 20 years, I\'ve been watching heavily edited versions of the show.  But not anymore!  \n\nOther reviewers have described the episodes, so I won\'t waste time doing that.  Suffice it to say, the show was ahead of its time as it really didn\'t become popular until it was made into the first Naked Gun movie 6 years later (and had two subsequent hit sequels).  But I was one of the few who knew in 1982 that it was a clsassic.  I always wondered why the show never worked on TV, but Leslie Nielsen probably explains it best in his interview that is included on the DVD.  He says that you actually had to pay attention and most TV is meant to be watched almost passively while doing something else.  And I think he\'s right.\n\nSo it\'s great to have these shows.  The extras are just so-so as the interview with Nielsen is too short and I don\'t think the commentaries give much to the episodes (especially the one commented on by Robert Wuhl of "Arliss" fame, who was a writer for the show).  Wuhl must say a dozen times "I don\'t remember this."  Might have helped, Bob, if you took 25 minutes to watch it before watching it for the commentary.  But I won\'t trim the rating.  It\'s the shows I wanted and have now received\n'

aS'\tSeason 3--Steele as good as ever!\n \tSEASON 1: Wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit, incredible acting for a TV series, and classic plots.  All around a great opening season for a classic show.\n\nSEASON 2: Great story lines, very different plots, thickening of the chemistry between Remington and Laura with lots of cliff-hanger moments.  The addition of Mildred Krebs in Season 2 was the best move that the show producers made.\n\nSEASON 3: TOPS the first two seasons.  It\'s hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting.  The most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great, classic show.  Laura (Stephanie) and Remington (Pierce) are really just starting to get into the groove of their ever-messy, non-relationship, relationship, and Mildred (Doris) is just starting to blossom as an actual "Gumshoe".  It is really too bad that this show ended after only 5 seasons.\n\nThe good news in all of this is that you can watch the shows over and over and not get tired of them.  I would highly recommend purchasing Seasons 1-3 (because I\'ve seen them already), as well as the final set of discs (Seasons 4  and  5), even though I have not yet watched them (I\'m trying to drag it out and make the show last longer!).\n\nOne MAJOR down-side (not with the show itself but with the DVD discs) is that we have experienced some technical errors with the discs--stopping completly, skipping to the end or back to the beginning, skipping chapters, etc.  One disc will not even play in our computer, which was disappointing because we only figured that out once we were in Africa for 4 months and trying to watch the show one night to relax.  It\'s too bad that they don\'t take more care transfering great shows like this to quality DVD\'s for years of non-skipping enjoyment.  The same disc didn\'t have as much trouble playing in our actual DVD player once we were back in the States, but still skipped from time to time.\n\nOverall Show Rating: ***** (5 Stars)\n\nOverall Disc Rating: *** (3 Stars)\n'

aV	Definitely worth watching!\u000a 	Dark atmospheric telling of the tale. Very decent! It is a simply told ancient tale. The scenery is gorgeous. There's a good atmosphere of the barbaric time. It's a good movie, a lot of twisted emotion right up to the end. \u000a\u000aThe movie conjures up thoughts of Gerard Butler as Aragorn, and Ingvar Eggert Sigur\ufffdsson as Theodin in LOTR.\u000a

aS"\tWonderful\n \tWonderful\n\nTerry Gilliam is the Orson Welles of our time.  Lambasted by critics for his excesses, admired by others for his genius.  I'm with the genius crowd.  Brothers Grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie I've seen in a long while.  Gilliam's style is baroque, and by a director who knows the definition.  Visually, this can be quite stunning, as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene.  Sort of like a Durer woodcut as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. And the Brothers Grimm is perfect ground for Gilliam's magic - a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas.  It's 1812, the Age of Napoleon, not a good time for the Imagination.  Nevertheless, con-men Jake  and  Will Grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear, since it's also an Age of Anxiety, and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night.  The bumbling Grimms are played, quite effectively by Matt Damon (who pulls off the accent nicely) and Heath Ledger (a head scratching, eye-squinting success).  Their evil counterparts, End Products from the Age of Reason, are a French general, played by Jonathan Pryce, and his wacky henchman, played by the always wonderful Peter Stormare.  Little girls are disappearing in a small town, and something needs to be done about it.  And the Grimms are caught in the middle.  You will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales, as the Grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery.  To reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises.  Check it out\n"

aS"\tTwo excellent films for one low price\n \tSpider-Man (2002.) The first Spider-Man film.\nSpider-Man 2 (2004.) The second Spider-Man film. \n\nINTRODUCTION: \nIn 2002, the first of the live-action Spider-Man hit theatres. It's not likely that the film's director, Sam Raimi, had any idea just how successful his big-screen incarnation of the classic superhero would be. It drew in huge amounts of money at the theatres, and the DVD releases did the same. The sequel, appropriately enough, was even more hyped, and did even better. And now, both films have been combined into a single set! Read on for my review of the Spider-Man films.\n\nSTORYLINE: \nEssentially, this set includes both of the films. The first of the two films explains how Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained the powers that ultimately turned him into Spider-Man. In the first film, the villain is former head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn, who has been transformed into the Green Goblin by a chemical he was testing. The second film continues two years after the first left off, and features Spider-Man facing off against Doc Ock, a brilliant scientist who has gone mad due to a mixture of not getting the proper credit for his work and an electric shock that permanently grafted mechanical arms to his body. This time around, juggling the duties of being Spider-Man with work and school have made Peter Parker question whether or not he wants to continue the superhero lifestyle. \n\nOPINIONS: \nBoth of these films flat-out rule. Seeing the first film turned me into a Spider-Man fan practically overnight. The acting and storyline are both excellent, particuarly Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Everything the first film did well, the second one does even better. I was amazed that they managed to create a sequel superior to the original film, since sequels rarely top the film that comes before them - but Sam Raimi does it here. These are great films, and the fact that they're together in one package only sweetens the deal.\n\nDVD: \nThese are the standard DVD releases of the film, meaning each one has a bonus disc of material. There are a ton of bonus features, including commentary, cast and crew interviews, and assorted other extras too. The second disc included with the first film even has a listing of a ton of the old comic books, and the plotlines of them! That's my favorite extra on either of the discs. The other features are also excellent, and if you like the films, you'll agree they're worthwhile.\n\nOVERALL: \nI can't begin to express my satisfaction with these films. The cast and crew have creates two cinematic masterpiece, and I think you'll agree superhero movies don't get any better. Being able to get both movies in a single set makes the deal all the more sweet. These are must-watch movies, regardless of who you are. Even if you're not a big fan of the Spider-Man franchise, you may be pleasantly surprised\n"

aS'\tOrson Welles\' astonishing directorial debut\n \tWhat can one add to what\'s already been written about the movie many consider to be the greatest film of all time? "Citizen Kane" has been analyzed more than any other movie, in part because the story behind the film is as interesting as "Kane" itself. It\'s therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the documentary "The Battle over Citizen Kane" and the HBO film "RKO 281."\n\nI\'m amazed at how many people I encounter who have watched "Citizen Kane" once and thought it was just OK.  But seeing it once is simply not enough. This is true of any great film, but more so for "Kane," a multifaceted work that cannot be fully digested upon first viewing. In many ways, "Kane" is the Bible of modern cinema: you\'ll find something new each time you watch it.\n\nOrson Welles\' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman\'s wizardry. Welles\' Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast.\n\nThe expertly produced documentary, "The Battle over Citizen Kane," recounts the factors that nearly prevented Welles\' film from seeing the light of day. But it belabors the comparison between Welles and Hearst. Both were certainly ambitious men, and Charles Foster Kane is based as much on Welles as on Hearst, but the similarities end shortly thereafter. By repeating the popular wisdom that Welles\' career tanked after "Kane," the documentary glosses over Welles\' achievements. Welles went on to make several great films, two of which ("Touch of Evil" and "Chimes at Midnight") are often cited by Welles scholars as superior to "Kane."\n\nWhile the documentary overdoes the comparisons between Welles and Hearst, "RKO 281" distorts the relationship between Welles (Liev Schrieber) and "Kane" co-writer Herman Mankiewicz (John Malkovich). Mankiewicz was holed up with Welles\' Mercury Theatre partner John Houseman - not Welles - at Victorville, and Houseman was Welles\' confidant throughout the "Kane" controversy, not Mankiewicz.  If the film simplifies real-life relationships, it remains an enjoyable - if somewhat lightweight - re-enactment of the controversy, with great performances by James Cromwell as the imperious Hearst and Melanie Griffith as the ditsy Marion Davies.\n\nBack to the inevitable question: is "Citizen Kane" the greatest movie of all time? Quite possibly, though "Touch of Evil" might be even better among Welles\' own films. But "Kane" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. "Citizen Kane" has topped the highly regarded "Sight and Sound" polls since 1962, and the American Film Institute reinforced "Kane\'s" #1 status with its 1998 Top 100 list. Can all the critics, experts, and film buffs all be wrong? Watch "Citizen Kane" - not once, but twice or more - and decide for yourself\n'

aS'\tOne of the Best Films Ever Made\n \tThe Great Dictator is a film that took such courage from the star and director, Charlie Chaplin. The movie was filmed and released at the beginnings of World War 2 and at the rise of the Nazi party. The similarities between dictator Adolf Hitler and the comedic genius that is Charlie Chaplin is quite interesting: both sported the small mustache and were born in the same year, same month, in the same week. Chaplin took a serious approach when spoofing Hitler for this film; he viewed many news reels and studied his technique before making it funny on film. \nThe Great Dictator has the ability to tug at your heart and make you laugh until you cry. The music is gorgeous and the writing is superb. Though some scenes do drag a bit, most of it flows smoothly. \nPerhaps the most famous scene in the movie is the final speech given by Chaplin. It is just him staring at the camera, and nothing stops him from saying what he feels.\nMovie buffs have to see this film. The Great Dictator is a beautiful presentation that showcases the cinema genius of Charlie Chaplin\n'

aS'\tNow This Is Suspense\n \tThere isn\'t one wasted second in this film.  Not one!!!  You\'ll be sucked in, and surprised, within the first two minutes, and there\'s very little dialogue so you need not worry about too much subtitle reading.  You can tell there\'s a lot of influence from American film noir in this film, but "Le Samourai" takes it to a level of perfection.  I wish some of the folks that throw their good money towards bad modern action flicks would take the time to watch "Le Samourai" they just might discover a thing or two about how it could really be done.  Brilliant\n'

aS"\tSoMe LIkE it HoT\n \tIn the movie Some Like It Hot its a great movie and its genre is comic and lovely.It takes place in Chicago and in Forida.This movie is about two musicians that accidentallywitness a gangland shooting and then they the other people wanted to killed them. Morover they two musicians Joe(Tony Curtis) and Jerry(Jack Lemmon)decide to go to Florida to participate to a girl jazz band. The problem is that they cannot go as boys so they decide to dress themselves as girls and to present themselves as JOsephine and Daphne. in they way to Forida they meet a lverlorn singer that is Marilyn MOnroe.Their plan is perfect until  Josephine falls in love with Marilyn Monroe. Then at the same time a old man falls in love with daphne and wants to engage her.\n\nOne conflict that the movie has is when the old man tries to engage daphne but she told hin that they can't marrie and she gievs a lot of excuses to him and he says that it doesn't matter that he would forgive her. in addition at the end she says to him that she is a man and he asnwers him that is ok that nobody is perfect. I think that was a good conflict because eventhough she try to get away with it he accepts her without having a problem.The usual is that he wouldn't accept her bor being a man, but that didnt matter to him.\n\nThe character in this movie are really good actors all of them had a great actuation.The only thing that was different is that the gangster got killed and i think they didnt have a good acting. all the sets wre good except for the one that i just talk about. The lightning in the movie was very creative it was very good, the costumes wre really nice and everyone dressed great in the movie.\n\nThe music the movie has was ok too because it goes with the type of the movie. I had never seem a movie like this and i think it may relationate with the real life where people does this kind of things. I recomend this film to all the people that want to have some fun and entertain themselves with something good like this movie.\n"

aS'\tReview of 3 Games to Glory III\n \tIntroduction\n\n3 Games to Glory III is a two-disc video compilation of the 2004 New England Patriots playoffs, including their Super Bowl victory over the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 in Super Bowl XXXIX.  This Super Bowl victory was the Patriots third in four years, marking them as the team of `00s.  For New England Patriots fans it\'s a chance to relive the glory of back-to-back Super Bowl victories and three championships in four years.  Non-New England Patriots fans probably would not particularly enjoy this in-depth video. \n\nMain Features\n\n3 Games to Glory III provides extensive highlights of both New England Patriots\' playoff wins and Super Bowl victory after the 2004 season.  \n\nThese playoffs found New England once again schooling the Indianapolis Colts in yet another year where Peyton Manning and the vaunted Colts offensive choke under playoff pressure.  The high flying Colts offense was throttled by the superior schemes and tough play of the Patriots in a 20-3 AFC Divisional Playoff win at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. \n\nThis is followed by New England\'s dramatic defeat of the Pittsburgh Steelers, 41-27, in the AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh.  The Patriots entered this game as decided underdogs to the 15-1 Steelers after being throttled by Pittsburgh earlier in the season.\n\nFinally, you get to enjoy the extensive highlights of New England\'s impressive 24-21 win over the NFC Champion Philadelphia Eagles.  This is yet another game where New England\'s superior execution and stamina in the later stages of the game brought them ultimate glory.  The Super Bowl was played in Jacksonville, Florida on February 6, 2005.\n\nThe highlights of each game are very extensive and seem to cover nearly every play.  They are also mostly well done, but frankly the highlights often fail to capture the real drama of the game.  Of course no highlight reel can match the excitement and drama of a live contest, but there are times when key turning points of the game really just become another quick hit in the video.  \n\nThere are a few disappointments in this video though and it\'s not quite as well done as the preceding 3 Games to Glory II (covering the Patriots playoff run and Super Bowl victory after the 2003 season).  First, there is not as much pre-game drama and preparation presented in these videos compared to last year.  Secondly, there are not as many close up, on the field shots that bring the game right into your living room.  It\'s much more distant and not as close up as previous editions in this series.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, it\'s still great to relive a great season through these videos.\n\nBonus Features\n\nThe bonus features on this edition of 3 Games to Glory are not nearly as good as the ones on 3 Games to Glory II.  The bonus features are nice they just didn\'t live up the standard in the previous edition.  Following is a brief rundown of what you\'ll get on the DVD.\n\nThere are some "Bill Belichick" breakdowns of key plays for each game but there are very few of them and really leaves the viewer wanting more.  \n\nThere\'s also a "Points After: Sounds of the Game" which shows post-Super Bowl press conference features, but again, it\'s really short and leaves you wanting more.\n\nThe "Patriot\'s All Access" which appears along with each of the playoff and Super Bowl wins shows locker room scenes and practices, team meetings, and other shots of players as they prepare for games.  These are pretty well done short features that add a great deal to the video.  \n\nThe "All Access" section for the Super Bowl of course included pre-game plane trip, post game party and the parade.  I find these a bit boring frankly, but I guess it\'s nice to see the players up close on their daily routines.\n\nThe Super Bowl Highlights are shown twice, once with the regular commentary and once with commentary from Rosevelt Colvin (LB), Ted Johnson (LB), and Matt Light (T).  Matt Light is a funny guy and this was more entertaining than the one last year.\n\nI thought the best bonus feature was one on Disc Two called "Views from the Past" with interviews with three great players from previous decades - Gino Cappelletti of the 1960\'s, Michael Haynes of the 1970\'s, and Andre Tippett of the 1980\'s and 1990\'s.  This conversation was mostly about comparing this current Patriots\' team with teams of the past and how the game has changed over the decades.\n\nFinally, the video has the 2005 playoff roster, Super Bowl stats, and 2005 game by game results - just like you can get in any book, it just shows it printed on the screen.\n\nOverall, while all these bonus features are nice, 3 Games to Glory III is not nearly as good as 3 Games to Glory II.  It did not include an extensive behind the scenes segment on the Super Bowl, which I found fascinating on the previous edition, nor did it have highlights for each game of the regular season like the previous edition.  I found the lack of these too items very disappointing as I thought they were outstanding editions to last year\'s disc.  \n\nNevertheless, the bonus features overall are nice, just nice as nice as last time.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAll New England fans should enjoy reliving a third Super Bowl win through this highlights package.  It\'s mostly well done and certainly brings back great memories of a great season.  Those who are not Patriots fans I am sure would find the video quite boring.\n\nDisclaimer:  I am a die hard New England Patriots fan and am totally biased in this review\n'

aS'\tWow. Still, Wow\n \tI was reading some reviews of "The Quiet Man" earlier this year. And a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time, entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children, grandchildren and I imagine great grandchildren.\n\nIn that league of the timeless you have to put Ben-Hur, a story of love, redemtion, compassion, revenge, retribution, foregiveness and tranquility, in an epic truly larger than life. If we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago, then certainly William Wyler\'s third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view.\n\nFor me, seeing it again and again, I am always startled by Mr. Heston\'s skills as an actor, often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence. Here the antagonist is Stephen Boyd, Judah Ben-Hur\'s best friend from childhood, now addicted to the narcotic of power. The two will clash; this is the time of Christ\'s ministry. Christ is seen as a rabble rouser and Rome, an international giant the world had never seen, seeks to thwart that message by girding up Jerusalem. So they send the now goal oriented and vicious Messala to the home of Ben-Hur.\n\nHeston is also supported ably by Jack Hawkins, a brilliant actor in his prime, as the Roman Counsel Quintus Arrius. Judah Ben-Hur, sentenced to virtual death on the Roman Galleys, survives a battle with the Macedonians to only save Quintus Arius. \n\nI say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene, the arrival of Quintus Arrius in Rome, a hero, with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman, Judah Ben-Hur. William Wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as Jack Hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before Ceasar there must be 100 steps! And the camera back away to see Hawkins in his magenta robe, draped over the pure white stairs, climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire. In "Spartacus," also a fine movie a few years later, the script tells you about the size of the Roman empire. Here in this one scene, Wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word.\n\nAt the same time, Judah Ben-Hur, remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs, looks around and in that one expression on Heston\'s face of awe and the size and the power of 1st century Rome, he amplifies the scene of Hawkins climbing the staircase.\n\nA great, great move. Well worth your time if you have never seen it. Well worth your time again if you have. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur\n'

aS"\tSCARY!!!\n \tThis is a really scary movie.  I've always put Ju-On on the top mantle as being the scariest horror movie ever, but this movie surpasses that movie.  I didn't expect much, seeing the title of the movie which doesn't sound scary at all, but was I wrong, dead wrong.  If you are a horror fan, you got to see this movie.  The terror one feels stays with you even after the movie ends.  Cold chills ran through my bones and the hair never stopped standing at the back of my neck.  Asian horror movies don't rely on gore, but suspense and an ever so thickening creepiness that never stops.  Contemporary American horror movies don't scare me much anymore and it often relies on the same old tricks.  Asian horror movies like this one, which is Korean, is not an original idea, but the craft of scaring the living daylights out of you is getting stronger and better.  Other Asian titles I recommend are Ju-On, Dark Water, and The Red Shoes\n"

aS"\tGetting my feet wet.\n \tThis is a sad little gem of a movie.  I really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love. The story had as much to do with issues of identity, community, and fidelity.  In my opinion, there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved, especially when considering the quality of the performances.  The slight quiver in Weisz's voice was right on target as was Perez's accent. The rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable. Considering the type of story and the setting, I can't help but think that a three-part mini-series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film.  I emerged from watching the movie with a feeling  that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character\n"

aS'\tTONS of useful instruction - I love it!\n \tI\'m the kind of guy who takes out large clumps of grass with every swing no matter what club I use.

And after only a few rounds I could finally start to understand what\'s going on with each drive, approach and putt I hit and that\'s helped me improve enough that my friends are playing with me again. \nIn my opinion anyone would find these DVDs helpful. Even my local "golf pro" would benefit from this collection. However, I\'m not sure I\'ll give away my new edge to all my "friends". At least until I can cut a few more strokes and they have to play catch up.\n'

aS"\tHOORAY for SCTV!\n \tMartin Short joins the cast in this volume, securing this show's enduring genius and originality. The cast, brilliant as always, never fail to deliver. \nI grew up watching this show--- and what a thrill to have it on DVD. I feel like they have finally come home!!! woo hoo!!\n"
p364
aS"\tA great twist on a well-used plot\n \tTrapping a group of unsuspecting strangers in a house with no exits is not a new concept. They did it in Saw II, House on Haunted Hill, And Then There Were None, and I'm sure quite a few others. But that plot seems to always work. It does for me. House of 9 is no exception. It doesn't follow a storyline that's predictable, even though the plot is not unknown. There are surprises, suspense, thrills and tense moments. Believe me, you won't predict the ending. I was very satisfied with the movement of this film. It's an interesting watch\n"
p365
aS"\tThelonious!\n \tAn absolutely wonderful film by Clint Eastwood. Thelonious was an amazing man. He said things on the piano that we wordsmiths aren't able to communicate. His unusual character made for an interesting subplot. This film is footage of the man himself, usually playing his music. I'm just sitting here being stunned.\n"
p366
aS'\tGreat Acting, Great Movie\n \tGreat acting and development in the multi-linear plot movie. Very heavy movie however, that may be out of some people\'s "reach" as to understanding and appreciation. Strisand and Nolte were both brilliant\n'
p367
aS"\tMind trip  and  sensual candy!  Intelligent metaphors  and  character analogies!  Stunning, vibrant colors!\n \tI don't usually like romance films, but 2046 is brilliant!  \n\nA mind trip AND sensual candy!\n\nIf you have a short attention span, you will not appreciate this work of art.  But if the first half draws you in, the second half will BLOW YOUR MIND!\n\nWong Kar Wai sets up analogies between the relationships of each character.  By comparing characters in this way, we are given infinite perspectives on the characters and their emotions.\n\nThis is genius!\n\nThis is art!\n\nFull of colorful symbolism\n"
p368
aS"\tIn the 5 best movies ...\n \ti have ever seen.What to say for this film.Great acting,great story and great music.Don't hesitate go get it.This will be one of the gems in your movie collection.\nAnd please guys when you come to movies like this masterpiece don't give them a 3 star rate.Not beacuse it didn't have many extras or something like this.The movie is that counts\n"
p369
aS'\tVery Good\n \tFirst, off, if it has Pauly Shore it is pretty much guaranteed to be funny.  In this comedy, Pauly Shore and his buddy sign up to be in the reserves because they need the money, little does he know when he picks their area of expertise, water clarifacation, that it is something that will actually be needed and they get called into active duty.  Watch this movie\n'
p370
aS"\tIf we would be taking life as seriously as you....\n \t... then this would be a really serious detective. As it's executed now, it's a superbly relaxed copper-gets-the-villain with serious undertones. Cool\n"
p371
aS'\tDragonslayer\n \tGood movie with a unique storyline.  Special effects were very\ngood for the time of filming\n'
p372
aS'\tGood supplement to my regular routine\n \tI bought a balance ball kit from another location, but wanted a more complete workout than the sampler that came with the kit.  I like the workout a lot and I think it will be a good strengthening and toning tool.  I like that there is a separate relaxation workout for stress relief and I like that the workout cycles through the different body parts\n'
p373
aS'\tUnpretentious fun!\n \tThe great thing about the Naruto series is it has an involved, ongoing storyline without taking itself too seriously. The episodes are well translated and the actors well chosen. It has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams.\n\nMy small gripes are that for some reason Naruto has the catch phrase of "Believe it!", and it gets dropped into places that it doesn\'t make any sense, but it\'s a small problem.\n\nAlso the extras you get are really fun and high quality. This is a great package for the hardcore fan and newcomer alike\n'
p374
aS"\tOverhyped cult film finally makes good.\n \tI'd seen this film before, in a lesser unrestored edition, and wasn't that impressed. Sure there's some over-the-top moments worth a chuckle or two, but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull. Hardly the unintentional laugh riot it's reputed to be.\n\nThanks to Mike Nelson's biting commentary, however, now the film really is funny. Damn funny. Which is why I demand we pass legislation, the sooner the better, requiring Mike Nelson commentaries on every major DVD release from here on out. He may be Hollywood's last best hope, the only man who can save excrement like Mission Impossible 3 and Lady in the Water from heading straight to the bargain racks.\n\n(Okay, maybe I'm overrating Mike's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an Old Testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of Lady in the Water - but if Lucas gave him a crack at Episodes 1-3, I think we'd be looking at pure marketing gold. C'mon Lucas, you know you can't resist any excuse to re-release yet another DVD version of your little sci-fi sextology. Give the man a call.\n"
p375
aS"\tWell done, don't miss it!\n \tThis is one of the best movies I have ever seen, it has it all; suspense, good acting, good story line, and without much violence.\nThe plot is interesting, it keeps you guessing, and the suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nGreat job Hollywood, to all involved with this film, especially\nJodi Foster\n"
p376
aS'\tCool Movie Deserving of Better DVD\n \tCary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and a marvelous supporting cast that includes James Coburn (and a "killer" soundtrack by Henry Mancini) deserve much better treatment than they get in this no-frills DVD with absolutely no special features.\n\nThis comic murder mystery shows off its stars to their finest --in spite of a less than admirable film transfer.  It\'s all thanks to the great performances, tongue in cheek direction and witty screenplay.  Hopefully a better quality and enhanced DVD version will replace this one in your film library.  Nonetheless, "Charade" remains a charming and timeless classic\n'
p377
aS'\tWish Shania Would Stick With The Music She Does Best - Country!\n \tThis dvd shows Shania\'s potential as a serious musician. With Alison Krauss and Union Station as her back up here, she is simply riveting. Too bad she is more interested in making a quick buck these days marketing herself as a pop star and making purely pop albums like "Up!" instead of making enduring popular country classics like "The Woman In Me" and "Come On Over". Maybe she\'s living too well nowadays to make soulful music. Get this dvd if you want to hear Shania doing something good.\n\n4 Stars is for the short length of this dvd. We need at least 2 hours of this awesome music. Not the 50 minutes which is on this dvd. That\'s only enough time to drink 5 beers\n'
p378
aS'\t1975 World Series DVD Review\n \tThe product produced a clear picture good sound it was like being back in 1975 and experiencing that World Series for the first time. I enjoyed every minute of the games and interviews\n'
p379
aS"\tAWESOME!!!\n \tIf you are a Dale Jr fan,this dvd is for you!! I'm a hardcore fan and I loved this.It shows the other side of Dale off the track,him with his buddies and just hangin out.He lets you into his life which it pretty neat considering not many other drivers have done that.In the hidden footage you even get to see his cat Bud which adorable!!!He shows off his new home and the shop\n"
p380
aS'\tThere\'s something about repression.....\n \tRead between the lines, Stephane is nuts about her, and totally paralyzed.  This reminds me of Remains of the Day. Everything is inside, screaming to get out.  But there we are, tension city, with  nothing to do but yell at the screen, "Do something!!! Kiss her!! .."  THe emotional tension is as tight as the violin strings in the background!   Vive la repressione!\n'
p381
aS'\tHold onto your memories\n \tThat special team is gone, those players have mostly moved on, but "we\'ll always have 2004".  Great way to relive the fun, the hope and the victories.  For every diehard fan.\n'
p382
aS'\tThoughtful with interesting, sympathetic characters\n \tWhat happens when you title a movie "Mind the Gap" and lead the credits with Alan King? Few people under seventy become interested. But this is a great movie about life, relationships, and "the gap".\nJill Souble is darn cute, and the overall acting good to great. King did his usual pro job too\n'
p383
aS'\tThe Music Man\n \tRobert Preston is the best Professor Hill. This is definitely a classic keeper you want in your collectio\n'
p384
aS'\tContents of the set\n \tBefore anything else, I agree with those who say that Keaton\'s shorts are all good; but I strongly disagree with those who say that they are better than his better features. What usually happens with comedy is that people sit down before the screen and just say: OK, make me laugh. Keaton\'s features are funny -but they are also, and more important, beautifully shot, superbly acted and perfectly structured -which is something only the best actors/directors can put all together. There are no cheap sets like in most movies of the 20\'s. Keaton\'s characters move in the real world, with real things, and that\'s part of what makes them lasting and unique. \n\nIn your shelves, Keaton shouldn\'t share his place with the Marx Brothers, but with Orson Welles (who called The General the best movie ever made about the Civil War) and Martin Scorsese (who said he watched over and over the final fight in Battling Butter -which, by the way, is not supposed to make you laugh, but to surprise you with it\'s realism)\n\nNow, this are the complete contents of this DVD set. Aside from it, you should check out The Buster Keaton Collection, which includes THE CAMERAMAN, SPITE MARRIAGE and FREE AND EASY - and then you are done. Well, you could also read the only book he wrote -My Wonderful World of Slapstick. (June \'06 Update: "Industrial Strength Keaton"(DVD) just came out. The set includes rare industrial films, promotional films, commercials, TV appearances and outtakes.)\n \nThe Saphead: 1920\nIncludes the shorts ONE WEEK (1920) and THE HIGH SIGN (1920)\n\nThe Three Ages\nYear: 1923\nIncluding THE GOAT (1921) and MY WIFE\'S RELATION (1922).\n\nOur Hospitality / Sherlock, Jr.\nYear: 1923/1924\n\nThe Navigator\nYear: 1924\n Includes shorts The Boat (1921) and The Love Nest (1923).\n\nGo West\nYear: 1925\nIncludes THE SCARECROW (1920) and THE PALEFACE (1921).  \n\nSeven Chances\nYear: 1925\nShorts: Neighbors (1920)  and  The Balloonatic (1923)\n\nBattling Butler\nYear: 1926\nIncludes THE HAUNTED HOUSE (1921) and FROZEN NORTH (1922).  \n\nThe General\nYear: 1926\nshorts: The Playhouse (1921) and Cops (1922)\n\nCollege\nYear: 1927\n Includes THE ELECTRIC HOUSE (1922), HARD LUCK (in this version the ending is missing; but the complete version is found in the disc called Keaton Plus) (1921) and THE BLACKSMITH (1922). \n\nSteamboat Bill, Jr.\nYear: 1928\nshorts: Convict 13 (1920) and Daydreams (1922)\n\nKeaton Plus\nYear: 1920-2001\nColor home movies, complete short HARD LUCK, two Shorts from the 30\'s, commercials, TV shows and appearances. But best of all, Orson Welles talking about Keaton and The General\n'

aS'\tKathy Smith - Functionally Fit - Peak Fat Burning DVD\n \tI really enjoy this workout, with the DVD I can do over the workout phase without having to rewind like with the VHS.\nI originally wore out about 3 of her VHS workouts from rewinding and using again.  That makes it twice as much as you would just rewinding them once\n'
p386
aS"\tThe Best of the Bounties\n \tEven though it tends to drag and the abuse gets a bit repetitive, this is by far the best adaptation of the famous British Navy story. Gable and Laughton are perfect for their respective roles and the period is brilliantly displayed.  I'm not a huge Gable fan.  This and Gone W/ the Wind are abt all I like him in\n"
p387
aS'\tA classic\n \tIf you loved this movie, try 50 First Dates.  The surprising chemisty from Drew and Adam continues in that movie.  I love the humor and the 80s clothes!! :-\n'
p388
aS'\tafter the still birth of the last movie"jason goes to hell" jason comes back in the best of the series\n \tafter the worst "friday" movie of all time(and thats saying a lot) the series bounces back (nine years later) with this fun and nice change of pace for the series is just what the doctor ordered.having been caught and chained by the goverment, jason escapes killls everyone but one fine looking doctor who "buck rogers" like freezes jason and her self in the underground lab they are at.\n     flash foward to 2455 and earth,now unliveable, is visited by a group of students who free jason and the doctor from the lab. before you can say "CEH CEH CEH"( the best way i can spell the theme song) jason is loose on the starship and cutting apart the crew.\n     like i said the novel setting and the use of some great f/x make this one of the best of the series\n'
p389
aS"\tA sheep in wolf's clothing.\n \tBoy, did this movie suck at the beginning! And boy, did it just get better and better from there on in. Even the Oriental humor, which is usually so awful, was actually funny at times. The action sequences, while a little too often fanciful, were very impressive, even innovative. Chow is a talented guy. Having seen this I'm interested to see what his earlier work is like. If you like martial arts/action/weird comedy, you'll love this\n"
p390
aS'\tROURKE, ROBERTS, SINATRA SINGS "SUMMER WIND"\n \tWhat more can you ask for (Lou Monte doing LUNA LUNA LUNA, it\'s here). POPE is Vincent Patrick\'s best written work and his screenplay works with Rourke and Roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles.  The inside buzz is Michael Cimino sat in the directors chair, but evidence to the contrary is offered:  The film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors.  Instead, POPE is a raucous and likeable tale of NYC bottom feeders whose only place in Trump Tower would be behind a broom.  Geraldine Page gives an Oscar nominated supporting turn one year before her Best Actress win for TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL.  She\'s more enjoyable here\n'
p391
aS'\tThe Best Movie Adaptation I\'ve Seen to Date\n \tI\'m the biggest "Wuthering Heights" fan I know (ask anyone who knows me, and they\'ll tell you I borderline annoying with the subject). Having money left over from my birthday, I decided "Hey, why not buy yet another Wuthering Heights DVD?". I was a little skeptical about how it would be, seeing as all the adaptations I\'ve seen thus far haven\'t really taken the whole story into account. Of course, to do so would be a hard task for a movie. The story is complex and not a very average-movie-goer sort of plot. I was disappointed in the 1992 version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, although it\'s a good enough movie (as long as it didn\'t have Emily Bronte\'s Wuthering Heights as the title...). Other versions were all right, and although the 1939 version didn\'t showcase the second generation of the story, I found it better than \'92. \n\nNeedless to say, when I popped in the DVD, I was hooked by the first five minutes. Sure, the movie isn\'t EXACTLY like the story (I want you to show me a movie that is. And, as I said, this story is complex for the movies). Some of the things that are different/changed/added/etc., are the fact that, once again (as in many of the movie adaptations) Nelly is old from the start. Also, Heathcliff and Cathy are older than when most of the scenes in the story take place (such as when they visit the Lintons). Most "Wuthering Heights" fanatics know that Heathcliff and Cathy never consemate their relationship. However, there\'s many a kiss in the movie. \n\nThere are some other details of the movie that are different than the story, but I, a crazy "Wuthering Heights" and Bronte admirer, give this movie a bravo and would recommend to any other fan\n'
p392
aS"\tA Chris Farley classic\n \tJoseph Campbell would be proud of this coming of age hero story.\n\nHaru (Chris Farley) is a ninja school dropout. He still maintains a positive attitude. He gets an opportunity to help a Sally, a lady in distress (Nicollette Sheridan). His mission will eventually take him to the hills of Beverly. Sensei (Soon Tek Oh) is like a father to him. Sensei realizing he can not sway Haru from his mission sends another ninja Gobei (Robin Shou) who is Haru's spiritual brother to quietly help.\n\nOn this mission Haru, Gobei, and Sensei learn more about themselves.\n"
p393
aS'\tMonty Python and the Holy Grail\n \tAll Monty Python movies are a must-see. I think my generation has seen them all. I hope the younger generation (less than 40) watch at least one. The humor is at many levels, so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in. This just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing. Like all good humor, it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general, as well as, politics and religion (without getting nasty)\n'
p394
aS"\tCREEPY, EXISTENTIAL AND ULTRA-VIOLENT\n \tRevenge, it's said, is a meal best served cold. The creepy, existential, ultra-violent OLDBOY (Tartan) takes that dish and smashes it in your face with raging.\n\nWithout explanation, Oh Dae-Su, a businessman with a family, is kidnapped and imprisoned in a dank, dirty room for 15 years.  Suddenly he's released, given money, a cell phone and nice clothes.  On his way to revenge, he discovers his kidnapper still has plans for him, and it's something worse than what's already happened.  Now he's got five days to find him and balance the books.  \n\nRated R.  Genre: Asian Noir/Thriller.  2 Hours.  Actors: Min-sik Choi, Ji-tae Yu, Hye-jeong Kang, Dae-han Ji, Dal-su Oh.  Director: Chan-wook Par\n"

aS'\tGreat movie for Pre-teens!\n \tThis movie is really good for the pre-teen who is struggling to make the right choices.  I thought this movie was great! Im hearing that now girls as young as 8 are having oral sex because they want to be popular/cool and I like this movie because it shows the consequences of doing the wrong thing just to be popular.  Every young girl needs to see this one\n'
p396
aS"\tBetter than I was expecting\n \tWaiting was a pleasant surprise.\n\nIt's certainly filled with crude humor, but it manages to be funny anyhow. My first job was in a restaurant much like Shenaniganz and perhaps that's why I found the movie so worth watching.\n\nThe game the employees play is over the top, but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on. If you're a rude anus of a customer, don't think for a second that the wait staff and cooks won't mess with your food - they will. It pays to be polite and tip well, especially if you are a regular.\n\nChi McBride's character as the dishwasher who also dispenses free psychological advice was great, and I thought Luis Guzman did a great job as Raddimus.\n\nAll in all, based on personal experience, the movie wasn't that far off of what really does happen behind the scenes in a typical Golden Corral or Ryan's Steak House. Sure, the characters are over the top, but they are based on people just like some I've known.\n\nIf you're offended by frontal male and female nudity or crass sex jokes you won't want to see this movie\n"
p397
aS"\tVerhoeven Never Ceases To Amaze\n \tYet another amazing film from Paul Verhoeven with so much depth and weight I can't even tell you.  Stays with you a long time after the film is over which many of his films have a tendency to do.  Jeroen Krabbe gives an excellent performance as does Rutger Hauer in the leading role.  Everything in this film is top notch particularly if you are in any way a fan of war films.  So many great scenes (i.e. Alex and Eric's tango towards the end,  and quot;april fools day and quot;, vengeance on a bicycle, the beach scene and many many more.)  See this as soon as possible.  It would make a terrific double feature with the Young Lions\n"
p398
aS'\tYip, Yip, Yip...\n \tLove it...love them all.  Disagree about the pace of this one.  Heart of the Jungle is great even though it is slower and you have to own this one just to get the Tea Party show.\n\nIt is a must have.  Even if it is just for Polka Palace which is great unto itself.\n'
p399
aS"\tPokemon the Movie 7: Visitor From The Space Fissure\n \t(Just as a note, that's the Japanese title)\n\nThere's something about this movie that I've always liked. I'm not sure what it is, but being a Pokemon fan, of course I like it. The movie have always been great, and this one has something that I really like about it. \n\nThe movie starts out in the North Pole, with a scientist named Dr. Lund, his friend Yuko, and his son, Tory. There is suddenly an explosion, and Tory is trampled by a frightened pack of Walrein. And, as they say, after that, all heck broke looks.\n\nA meteor is the reason for the explosion, and the creature inside the meteor is more than your average Pokemon. Deoxys, a rare Pokemon from another planet (woah, more than one Poke-Planet? Niiice.) The strange creature, carrying a rock with a gem inside, is suddenly attacked by the large, dragon-esque Rayquaza, a frequenter of the Ozone Layer. So, what the heck is he here for?\n\nAh, So Rayquaza feels threatened by Deoxys, and so, both pokemon break out in a rather spectacular pokemon battle. (With some pretty cool background music, might I add.) So, professor Lund flees with his colleages, and son.\n\nFour years later, a young Pokemon trainer named Ash Ketchum, along with some friends, enter the high tech city of La Rousse, and as fate would have it, Tory's hometown. And, well, I won't spoil it from there. The plot is good, and Deoxys' 'destructive' intentions are less cruel than one would think. Don't worry, folks, no angsty Mewtwo-copy here.\n\nAlso, Rayquaza brings some nice battles into the movie. His fights against Deoxys are totally awesome. The soundtrack is also great. I really love the music played during The opening scenes of the movie, and the fights between Rayquaza and Deoxys. The animation is very spiffy, shiny bright and new :P. \n\nI haven't had the pleasure of watching the original Japanese version of the movie, but when I do, I'll tell you all about it, 'kay?\n\nWell, I guess that pretty much wraps things up. Oh yes, Tory's afraid of pokemon, due to the whole 'get attacked by a herd of walrein' thing. Heh. Okay then, Sayanora, faithful readers!\n"
