S"Don't buy Nike sneakers if you want to return or exchange them.. I've bought many from them. I went this week  and bought 2 pairs of Nike SB's that were already over retail price as it is.. I tried on one side then bought them... When I got home I realized that one of the shoes were damaged.. It's only been 2 days and they said they can't take it back.. I've bought many shoes there and this will be the last time... I'm from Nor Cal and people are crazy about sneakers out there and all the shops will accept a return or exchanged within 14- 30 days.. This was the first place that does not do that.. Why? Because sneakers and SB's are not big in AZ... They don't sell here.. I wouldn't buy them there if I were you.\n"

aS"We don't have this fast food restaurant in Canada so I had to come back here after a stop in Montana three years ago. I remembered the burger to be delicious. I know its fast food but that doesn't mean it can't taste good. \\nI had the original burger and the onion rings. I can say that while I ate every last ring, they were good but certainly not great. I had the burger the way it came and maybe I added bacon last time. It was good, I suppose even really good considering we are at a fast food joint. Its not going to unseat the Big Mac or even the Quarter Pounder in my mind but it was good. I think maybe i could eat here once a month, tops. \\nMy wife had the Guacamole and Bacon burger. She really loved it. I don't know, not my thing but she insisted I try it. After saying no thank you at least six times I finally graciously accepted a bite. Like I said, not my thing. \\nShe also had a creamsicle milkshake which tasted just like a creamsicle. Again she enjoyed it.\n"

I went today and it was definitely below average.  \\n\\nThe House Fried Rice is really the only thing I've ever eaten here that was legitimately good.  Everything else is utility.\n"

From quality of \'management\' to condition of the rooms, Motel 6 Scottsdale is truly a dump of a hotel in every sense of the word. Not only was my bed infested with living bugs, but the shower was broken, and green mold was all over the baseboard. When I asked the \'manager on duty\' (heavy set, tattooed gentlemen named Michael) if he was aware that his rooms were infested with insects, he started laughing and accused me of making the whole thing up. I proceeded to return to my hotel room to photograph the bugs to prove I was being truthful. Michael continued to giggle and said \\Sorry, nothing I can do.\\"""" I then demanded my money back, which Michael initially refused to offer. He finally refunded my money after I threatened to take Motel 6 to small claims court. All I can say is, whoever the \'real\' GM of this particular Motel 6 is - you need to take a long hard look at the quality of employees you hire. This experience will keep me from staying at any Motel 6 ever again."""""""\n'

No gun fights (the nearby shooting range gave us a false hope when we had gotten out of the car), no demos, no people in costume, NOTHING. Even the pigs and chickens near the Northern House were out of sight. \\n\\nThe buildings were fairly dilapidated, which isn\'t surprising. But bees and wasps were living in the dried mud of the structures. BEWARE.  \\n\\nComparing this place to Rawhide isn\'t quite fair considering the fact that Rawhide\'s pretty much a set and it\'s designed for kids. Goldfield would be a closer comparison since it actually looks like a ghosttown with people in costume. At least with those locations you didn\'t pay anything to pretty much wander around an empty town. At both Goldfield and Rawhide, most things are all in one area with many shops, vendors, activities, people to interact with, and things to see. \\n\\nNOT SO with Pioneer Village. I might be biased because I also had an injured leg, but everything was spread out. You would walk for 10-15 minutes to a far off building just to stare in the windows at pretty much nothing.  \\n\\nI really wanted my $7 back.

By strange I mean not good....what is this???? and why would this taste this way??? I am not sure how one could mess up penne pasta with Greek dressing or orzo pasta but they managed to make it inedible. Many things looked pretty dry and maybe not from today. The cook staff loading things in using their fingers is a little unappetizing too. Like another review said, maybe they could make it if they took out two buffets and just had two. Then they could focus on the better dishes. The straw that made them get 1 instead of 2 stars was that they charge you $1 for each tap water they serve your table.... Really? $6 for tap water for our table. I admit I am very picky but my husband is not. His motto is quantity over quality. And he said we will not go back. I would rather have one dish cost $10 or more and have it be really good than have 70 ok or inedible dishes. I hope to hear that they shorten the buffet and focus on quality.

It happens to be in a convenient location (in chain restaurant hell off of Stapley and the 60) and we've had drinks there a couple of times.  It's really a pretty restaurant inside....too bad the food doesn't live up to the atmosphere.  They've been advertising $5.99 lunch specials via their email list, so I thought it might be worth a try.  \\n\\nThe large  menu seems fairly impressive and includes fresh seafood, fried specialties, pasta, salads and a long list of sandwiches and wraps.  We opted to share the Calamari Salad and the fried  Alaskan Cod/Shrimp/Chicken lunch.  We should have been forewarned when the food suddenly appears within five minutes of ordering.  To put it nicely, the salad just plain sucked.  The menu describes it as a Greek salad....NOT.  Wilted romaine lettuce tossed with some sort of sickeningly sweet poppyseed dressing (WTH?) and a few pieces of calamari on top.  I will say, however, that the tender, non-greasy pieces of calamari are the reason why I'm NOT giving this place one star.  The fried platter was OK...she ate the fish and I ate the shrimp and chicken.  The fries weren't bad...just nothing to write home about and the cole slaw was barely passable.    \\n\\nThe service wasn't much better than two stars as well....I mean just because we're drinking H2O with lemon and not having cocktails doesn't mean you can ignore our need for refills. On our last visit we sat at the bar and ordered martinis...I guess that doesn't count.\\n\\nAnyway, we didn't pay for the salad (thank God) and I left starving..it really wasn't even the equivalent of sharing two appetizers since the portions are small to begin with and we weren't inclined to finish either dish.  I'm embarressed to say it, but I'm sure Red Lobster would have been a better option, or, even Long John Silvers for that matter :(\n"

aS'"""I booked my birthday party here, mostly because of it\'s close proximity to The Duce. I was in contact with someone who said she was the Manager, Daron Harvey. She was great and said she would extend happy hour for my party. However, upon arrival, the night of my party, the manager on duty had no idea my party was coming. When I told him that I had spoken to a manager about having my party there and he snidely remarked, \\that\'s weird, I\'m the manager.\\"""" Wow, way to be nice about the amount of business I am about to bring your bar. To top it off, we got there at 9pm, which is what I told the Manager I was e-mailing, just to find out they normally close at 10pm on non-Suns game nights, unless they have 20+ people. So, now I feel awkward \'cause we\'re keeping these servers past the time that they probably thought they were going home. \\n\\nThe only reason I am not giving them one star is that they were still able to accommodate my party and give us the specials. Except after 1.5 hours of being there, the server asks me if we\'re all on separate checks. I don\'t understand how you just assume these things and we had to wait a bit longer to get our tabs. Lastly, I get the rule to add gratuity for such a big party, but the gratuity added was 22%. Random. \\n\\nSuch a terrible experience."""""""\n'

aS"Totally forgot to Yelp about the fat chick behind the bar that apparently is pretty bitter about not being let on stage. Opened up a tab (She also required my ID) and when I went back for round two she didn't remember me and had lost my credit card and my driver's license. Obviously not wanting to be wrong she calls over her trusty meathead who kicks me out of the club without discussion. So I stand outside refusing to leave until I get my stuff back and eventually a bouncer comes out, doesn't apologize, and hands me my cards. I realize these people deal with scumbags all the time but I had barely finished my first drink before they booted me out for demanding that someone return to me what was mine. I'll probably go back but I'll definitely need to bring some Taco Bell in a horse feed bag to bribe/distract that thing behind the bar while I enjoy my night.\n"

aS'"""Went here for a quick bite with family before a play at Phoenix Theater.  I was hesitant based on the reviews here about cleanliness and mediocre food, but the place is a local legend and we had to give it a try.  On the way to our booth, we passed a large empty table that still had the messy remains of previous diners and wondered why the not-busy-at-all waitstaff hadn\'t cleaned it up yet. The food was on the high side of \\just OK.\\""""  The malt, ice-cream soda, and phosphates we ordered with dinner were fantastic.  But, before the final curtain of the show, the cramping began for what would be a 24-hour bout of food poisoning traced back - by process of elimination - to McAlpines chicken salad.

aS"This was my first visit to this new location of OSF in the chandler mall, and I'll tell you right now, I don't know if the other locations are this bad, but I will not be returning... If you're wondering why, read on, you'll see.\\n\\n\\n---Service---\\nWe had a table of 10, which i understand can be difficult, but in a restaurant this big that seats probably 150 people or so, they shouldn't have trouble with a table of 10. We were seated promptly enough, and our waitress took drink orders while we were still waiting for half of our crew. Once everyone else showed up she took their orders, but completely forgot my friend. He eventually got a water, but by that time we were about half way done with our meal. When the food that we ordered arrived, my friend who didn't get a drink also didn't get his entr\\u00e9e. It came out about 5 minutes after everyone elses. My wife and I ordered garlic cheese bread as an appetizer and we didn't get it until 10 minutes after we were done eating dinner. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, which I don't buy at all. She simply forgot to place the order until i mentioned it was missing, plain and simple. When the bill came we noticed that the two drinks we ordered were missing from the tab and we notified the waitress of her mistake. What she should have done was apologize for the poor service and numerous mistakes she made and comp'd the drinks and the garlic bread, but instead she corrected her mistake and she threw away an opportunity win some brownies points and any kind of a reasonable tip. Sadly, this had to be some of the worst service I've received at a restaurant in recent history.\\n\\n\\n---Atmosphere----\\nAs far as the restaurant itself is concerned, they did a really good job converting a rather eclectic Mexican place into a nicely furnished and modern feeling Italian joint. Our party was seated closer to the front of the restaurant, and because they left the outer doors of the two doored entry way wide open, whenever anybody would come inside there was a giant gush of cold air that would sweep in, making everyone at my table cold while trying to enjoy out no-longer-hot food. What's the point of having two entry doors if you leave the outside doors wide open!! Seriously people. It was pretty noisy and chaotic inside as well. All the waiters and waitresses seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The nature of the building also lends itself to being acoustically boisterous, that is to say, this isn't the place to come if you're in the mood for a quiet dinner with your loved one. \\n\\n\\n----Quality----\\nNone of this even speaks to the quality of the food, which is to say, quite sub par considering the prices on the menu. My wife and I ordered the whole wheat spaghetti with mushrooms and marinara sauce. The portion size was smaller than average for a $10 plate, and the sauce was way to wet and there was way to much of it. My spaghetti was drowning in a thin red soup. I've made better at home! My brother in law ordered the chicken parm and his meal was just as bland and boring. The serving of spaghetti he got was tiny, and the chicken breast wasn't even breaded, which may be healthier for you, but it's not chicken parm unless that chicken is deep fried and crispy. The salad we got before the meal was sub standard by any means, low quality ice berg with a few tiny croutons. The creamy pesto sauce that came with it was good, but not so good that it warrants drowning your lettuce in it (which is was). The cheesy garlic bread that we received ten minutes too late was actually pretty decent although a bit greasy for my taste. The sourdough bread was fresh and warm, however, don't expect to get a fresh loaf if the kitchen is out of knives, apparently they won't bring you one unless they have a fresh knife to give you as well. The ice cream we got after the meal was decent enough, I enjoyed the flavor of the spumoni, however, there were ice crystals in it, which leads me to conclude the ice cream tub had been left out and refrozen after a while, ruining the smooth texture it should have. There's no excuse for that. \\n\\n\\n---Summary----\\nI don't give out 1 star reviews very often, as I'm usually easier to please, but last night it seemed like it was consistently one thing after another that just piled on top of each other. Eating here made me long for olive garden, which at the very least is quieter and as far as I can tell, has much better food. I can only imagine what the lease is costing them for that location, and I'm sad to say it, but I actually hope they go out of business to save anyone else from the experience of dining there. Maybe they can turn things around, maybe they can't. From the other reviews I've seen so far, it appears as though they're making a habit of pissing off their customers. So there's nothing left to say but good riddance, I hope whoever takes over that space next actually puts some thought into how to run a restaurant.\n"

aS'After several good meals at FnB, last nights experience came up very short.  We had a 6:45 reservation and when we made the reservation were told that the next reservation for the table was at 9:00 so we would need to be finished by then.  The waiter was terrific but the food came up very short.  The food was piled in in small plates and looked very unappetizing.  While the fried green tomatoes were good there were smothered in a sauce and covered with a large handful of greens.  The waiter went to great lengths to describe the special orange appetizer with various exotic spices.  It looked and tasted like orange slices with some kind of cheese.  The ribeye looked unappetizing and was very tough.  The pink grouper was piled on a small plate with cauliflower, broccoli and confusing spices - smelled fishy and was undercooked.\\n\\nAt 8:40 we had paid and were finishing up a conversation when the hostess very rudely informed us that we had to leave as the next reservation had arrived, apparently 20 minutes early.\\n\\nAll in all an expensive and very unsatisfactory evening.  They seemed more interested in turning the tables than providing a pleasant dining experience.\n'

aS"We used to order from NYPD quite often, but this place has gone straight downhill in the last few years.\\n\\nWe called for pick-up tonight and were put on hold. No problem, it's dinnertime and they're busy. Someone comes on the line and asks if we're ordering pickup or delivery. We tell them... and get put on hold again. Okay.\\n\\nThe guy taking our order seemed totally clueless - probably another new high schooler they hired. He required long pauses between each item of our huge order of 3 dishes and 2 sides. Not terribly difficult, we thought.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, they tried to tell us that the olive oil that goes on their pasta is plain. Um, seriously? I'm paying for plain olive oil on my plain pasta? I can do that myself! I know for a fact they usually season their olive oil, as do ALL decent Italian restaurants. The fact that I had to argue with them about it was ridiculous. We had to ASK for some garlic and seasoning to be mixed in for us. Thanks.\\n\\nNext, we specifically ordered garlic CHEESE knots - confirmed two times over the phone - only to arrive home and discover we had plain garlic knots. If we'd known, we would've saved the money and just had the ones that came with the entrees. Most upsetting was the fact that we were, indeed, charged for the CHEESE knots, not the plain ones. How complex IS this?\\n\\nFinally, we had to actually request a side of sauce for our cheesecake, when this was never explained over the phone. Funny, since the website menu specifically states the dessert comes with raspberry topping. If there were options, maybe we should have been informed when ordering. If we hadn't caught the mistake, we would've left with... a slice of plain cheesecake. Fantastic. For nearly 5 bucks? I can get two slices for half that at Walmart, strawberry swirl included.\\n\\nAll this for overpriced, bland food, an enormous wait time, an incompetent staff, and one huge headache. The pizza is good, sure, but the hassle is NOT worth it anymore. If this is how they run the show now, then I'll take my business somewhere tastier and cheaper.\n"

aS"Not sure what ladies the other raters were working with but the one that was there when I went in was borderline hostile towards me.  She reluctantly offered to help me and then gave me repeated dirty looks as I browsed through the store.   I mentioned having problems breastfeeding and she just stared at me then walked away.  Come to find out later they have classes and a lactation consultant.  Never were either of these things mentioned while I was there which I find weird, wouldn't one want to advertise these services?  Isn't making money the object of owning a business?\\nI was put off by her crap attitude and the elitist feel of the store.  Pretty much everything she had could be found other places for about half to 70% less money.  Tea for 14 dollars?  Yeah. I found that same tea for 4 dollars elsewhere.  I guess it's tough for me to believe that any normal person would want a duponi silk baby sling for an annoyingly high price.  Anyone who does breastfeed knows that milk pretty much as a way of getting everywhere, even silk baby slings.  \\nNot sure, maybe it was an off day for them but I would not recommend them to anyone if that is how they treat customers.  I guess I would recommend them if you like to be pretentious and spend way too much on stuff just because you can.  There are people like that in Scottsdale and this would be the place for them.\n"

aS'For a restaurant that supposedly prides itself on its five star service I was very disappointed. First off the waitress looked completely disheveled, messy hair too small faded black shirt and cheap looking black pants. Then when we placed out order for the mussels we were advised by her that they are very fishy this time of year. My husband had never tried them so we took a chance. We also ordered the Kobe beef sliders and the tomato salad. The Kobe sliders were so well done you could call them burnt, the salad was tiny with wilted lettuce and the mussels(surprisingly) were good. By the time we saw our waitress again we were finished with our meal. I asked her about the Kobe sliders and commented that they are always prepared well done and she quickly brushed off my comment and walked off.So much for the customer is always right. Needless to say my husband and I were very disappointed to spend a hefty amount of money for so-so food and terrible service. Needless to say we will not go to Different Pointe of View again and will NOT recommend it to our family and friends.\n'

The sandwich counter is good although it says sandwich in 3 minutes or its free and it always takes longer. (I never say anything because I don\'t care, I just don\'t see the point of the sign.) Their meat section is a joke lacking any real selection. The produce is almost always below my quality standards and is also lacking in selection.

aS'"""I would give this Capital Grille location no stars if possible. I don\'t mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn\'t even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \\corporate recipe\\"""", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn\'t it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \\""""signature\\"""" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I\'m not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn\'t the best and it wasn\'t the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire."""""""\n'

From the complaining checkers, the 3 girls that are busy sharing facebook photos and talking about dates while attempting to check me out, the terrible produce selection (I now buy all my produce at Sprouts)... ugh. My biggest complaint is how my groceries are bagged. I admit, I can be a tad ocd about things but when I unload my groceries and find soap with my eggs, it is incredibly annnoying. This store also employs 3 or 4 people with handicaps, which is fine other than when I come through with $150 worth of groceries, I expect them to come home with me in the same manner I picked them from the shelves...unharmed. I always try to avoid those lines. There is one guy that talks the entire time instead of bagging and then people behind me have to wait longer because he's so slow. I know that might sound mean but if an employee (whether handicapped or not) can't keep up, move to a line with less groceries. I don't spend $500/mo at this store to hang out and be patient with their mostly inadequate employees. I was so angry when I got home the other week, I actually took $50 worth of groceries back to make my point. Not surprising though, they don't really give a crap. Maybe it's the manager change, I'm not sure.\\nLike I said before, the only reason I don't go elsewhere is because I cannot afford the other stores.

It's little more than a neighborhood quick-e-mart. It's family owned I think, but the owner was a bit bristly with me when I was in there recently. \\n\\nI think this place could pile up bags of garbage in one of the aisles and people would still come here - there's nothing else close by for people in the neighborhood except for the grocery store on 48th.

aS'I have had similar issues like Jenny R. and Sara B. I am enrolling into CGCC Fall 2011 and I was a MCC student last year so I assumed everything would be updated across both schools, which is how they make it seem. CGCC was charging me out of county/state tuition, so I called and was put on hold for 15 mins, I was told that my account would be updated. Class started a few days later and I was able to log in with no issues. When I logged in on day two, I found out my class was dropped. So I spent another 13 mins on hold trying to resolve this issue, the rep said she watched her coworker update my file with the correct in county/state tuition. I am now showing as enrolled, but it is going to take up to 72 hours before I can access the online course through blackboard. I am so tired of people that cannot do their job. If the second rep could put me on hold for 5 mins to resolve this issue, why did I have to go through this at all?? I am going to take my class and hope December comes fast.

aS"I don't get why everyone loves this restaurant. Maybe the drinks are strong for a reason??? The food is ordinary, although reasonably priced. However, I have been to the restaurant twice and both times had shoddy service. The first time, the restaurant was extremely busy, so I could understand. The last time I was there with 4 colleagues for lunch. Two of us shared entrees. Two of my friends discussed with each other that they would also order a salad and share it, but asked the server not to split the salad, as there is a $5 fee for doing so, and they didn't need two plates. Instead the server did split the salad, so they were charged $10 for splitting both the entree and the salad. Then we found a hair in the hamburger we had split after almost eating all of it. By that time, the server was so slow, that we had run out of time for deserrt, had to return to work, and didn't even have time to discuss the hair in our food. It took forever for the server to come and pick up the payment for our check, so I took it up to the bartender, explaining that we were late getting to work and wanted to take care of it. I was rebuffed, and told that the server had to take it. He did not try to help me locate the server, so I waited some more. I will not return to this restaurant again.\n"

aS'"""My senior prom was held here some years ago and - much like the amalgammation of events that led up to my high school graduation - the Arizona Center still makes me feel socially awkward, unwanted, and uncomfortable.\\n\\nI don\'t even know the names of kitschy tourist shops here, but they definitely boast \\I\'ll Give up Breathing Before I Give Up Beer\\"""" shirts in their window displays. Ugh, really? Yeah, I so want to advertise to all the crackheads and hobos on Van Buren that I\'m 100% tore up in the middle of the day. Maybe I will buy some Kachina bobbleheads and flower-printed cardstock and call it a day. Not before I stop at Hooters on my lunch break, of course.\\n\\nI wish this place retained some of its former charm, or at least a viable destination for my too-short weekday lunches. Unfortunately it\'s chock full of douchebag midday Mill-rejects who jaywalk across Van Buren just to stop in the middle of a high-traffic area and look around stupidly for the best chain bar. And not that I bother with the upper level (what the hell is even up there? anything?), but has anyone noticed the broke-ass escalator that has been chained off for two years? Am I making this up? This place really can\'t be that bad, right?\\n\\nThe movie theater is decent if you\'re comparing it to the massacred, always full of the guy that thinks obvious foreshadowing in movies is  a profound revelation environment at the AZ Mills Harkins, but my only faint recollection of this place was watching the ATHF movie here while day-drunk, passing out a quarter of the way through. Maybe I shouldn\'t advertise that here. At least no one kicked me out, which is a plus, because I snore.\\n\\nThis place is way more fun at night when you\'re 17 and no one likes you.

I thought it was a real stuffed horse at first glance.\\n\\nOn a nice summer night, we weren\'t able to get a seat outside because there was a graduation party going on. Instead we sat inside and listened to the Michael Buble-ish croonster and his homeless sidekick. I\'m not sure if he was homeless but he was rocking on the bass guitar and would add in his \\oh yeahs\\"""" and \\""""uh huhs\\"""" during an intense jam session.

It was interesting but way too strong for my tastes.\\n\\nI started with an Oak Creek Hefe which was warm so the server brought me frosty mug but that didn\'t help either. I ordered the Spicy Cajun Sausage appetizer and it was nothing more than a bowl of sliced sausage links floating in a cold hot sauce. It was disgusting. I had to ask the server if the appetizer was meant to be cold. I\'m just not a fan of cold sausage. The best part of my meal was the sourdough bread- and it was damn good because I was starving!\\n\\nOh yeah- the bathroom was pretty scary.

aS"I have been to this place a few times because friends were already there and talked me into meeting them there. I have never really thought much of the food but it was not bad enough to write a review about. How bad can you mess up mexican food? But recently I dined at Julio G's and the experience was enough to inspire me to share.  First of all the decor has always bothered me there.  Pink Neon reminds me of some 50's diner.   I always expect to see a Milk Shake on the Menu when I sit down.  Also on this must recent visit I had really poor service. It was only slightly busy but it took an inordinate about of time to get a simple combo dish out.  \\n\\nThey thing that stuck me most about Julio G's was how expensive it was.  Nothing on the menu was less then $11 for a combo dish.  Actually I think a 2 item combo was like $10.95 and a 3 Item was like $11.95.  Man, $12 bucks for some marginal Mexican Food? I realize prices have gone up on food and produce.  I am sort of expecting to see some price increases across the board at some of my favorite spots.  But this was what I consider to be way out of line with the quality of food, service and overall dining experience.\n"

We noticed that the chicken tikka was sweeter than usual, when we asked the chef if it had ketchup or bbq sauce, he mentioned that they did use some ketchup.  \\n\\nWe ordered 3 other dishes, biryani, lamb chili, and chicken karahi.  The biryani was not fresh - the chicken was sub-par, the lamb chili was OK - a little bland, and the chicken karahi was relatively the better dish of the night.  Again, there was only one other table that was occupied, so maybe they weren't prepared?\\n\\nWe went there because we were at an event where they catered food from there, and that catered food was much better than what we had at the restaurant.   \\n\\nNot going back there.\n"

We asked for a HH menu and she came back several minutes later with one. Errrr.. OK, I guess the 3 of us can share... not that big of a deal I suppose. \\n\\n10 minutes later, she came back and we ordered our drinks and appetizers.

As for our drinks, she was OK if we flagged her down to take our (alcoholic) drink orders, but she was really scatterbrained when it came to refilling our waters! I asked several times for a refill, but she would walk away after refilling other people\'s half full glasses and ignore my completely empty glass. She did this to a few other people too that asked for water.\\n\\nThere were a few other servers that were helping her out w/ our table.

Oh, and the service is 5 stars. I've never had so many people say hi to me - I felt as popular as my facebook page. And my water was always filled, so I do appreciate that. But when it comes down to the nitty gritty, the food tasted like boo boo. I had the portabello chicken and I ate half of it. It just tasted like I was swallowing fat and grease. The cesear salad side was pretty tasty, but you aren't coming here for a salad. My girlfriend had the sirloin steak, and that was mediocre at best. I didnt think there was enough taste to the meat.

I chose my color, the guy kept wiping the brush off so that he would use only the most minimal of color on my nails (not what I wanted as I have had this color before and it should look better than clear polish on my nails).  He did not coat down to the cuticle either, he left a huge gap.  When I informed him that my nails needed to stay under the light longer than 30 seconds he argued with me.  I know that they have to be under the light for a minimum of 2 minutes (experience).  And when I told him he will have to put on a 3rd coat, he called to the female (who was helping him before) to come over and talk to me.  She did, and she ended up putting on the additional coats of polish, fixing his mistakes and being frustrated with me. When I paid, the femaile did give me a card and printed on the back that I would get $5.00 off my next visit.  I don't think going back and having a discount is worth the next visit.

The char siu bao is just gross.  The burger is decent and comes with some sweet potato fries.  had some duck cubes that were just cubes of protein that looked like they were dipped in hoisin sauce.  the desserts and tiki drinks fared better.  Stick with Maitais or hot buttered rum.  All of the drinks are sweet concoctions, but they claim to have invented the Mai Tai, and the hot buttered rum comes in a fun tiki glass. the desserts however were great.  Pineapple upside down cake, Snowall (vailla icecream, coconut shavings and chocolate sauce) and bread pudding were all top notch.  Took us $60.00 bucks to get out of there for two for happy hour so it still adds up.  hit or miss, better off going to Hulas.\n'

aS"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!\\n\\nThe nurse practitioner on duty was completely incompetent!  She was asking the assistant general procedure questions.  After 15 min. I picked up my baby and walked out.  How can a nurse practitioner not know how to answer general questions?   She actually guessed and then tried to verify with the assistant.  The assistant was very knowledgable and corrected her mistakes.  I left 4 messages and emails for the manager.  After 5 weeks was given a return call to tell me she had passed my messages on to the Doctor in charge.  I never received a call from him and it's now been 2 months.  This facility is horrible.  Go to PCH urgent care instead.  They are great!\n"

aS"This was the WORST Mexican food I have ever had, by far. I would give it a minus star or two if that was possible. Had to pay $2.75 extra for a beef machaca option on my chimichanga, and I expected shredded beef with no fillers. There was huge pieces of piping hot tomato and bell pepper inside, and the meat was flavorless and watery. My wife was asked if the would like sour cream  and  guacamole with her dish (which was also not meaty and very watery). She said OK- they brought two tiny containers. We also were charged an extra $2.50, and were not informed of that. I am from California, and am almost 50 years old, so I have eaten a lot of authentic Mexican food. This was garbage in it's highest form. The place also didn't smell good, and was dirty. Amazing they have been in business this long. The prices are also very high for any restaurant, especially one with this poor quality.\n"

aS'"""Some chicas and I were heading down to Phoenix to see a play on a Friday night, and needed a place close by the theater for some food and drinks prior (it is a play!)  I found District online and it looked promising and right across from the Herberger.  It is situated in the bottom of the Sheraton hotel, but is very large for a hotel bar/restaurant.  Online I learned they had a good looking happy hour with comfort type food and reasonable drinks - score!  They had a nice patio, so we asked the hostess if we could sit outside for happy hour, but she informed us we could not, only for dinner.  Hmmm, ok?  She said we could sit in the bar, but the bar was packed, not a seat to be had.  My friends and I joked that we could sit what looked like a rolling banquet cart - and try to find chairs.  I went to the bar to atleast get some cocktails while we hovered for a table.  I ordered 3 of the White Peach Sangria\'s, which were on happy hour for $3.75.  As great as they sound, they were not good.  It tasted like they had dumped the whole \\can\\"""" of cling peaches in the drink, because all I could taste was syrup.  We found a table and proceeded to order some food.  We shared the All American Cheeseburger, a huge burger a la carte, for only $6, the Sloppy Joe Sliders, 3 small sliders for $5 (manwich?.)  The Spiced Sweet Potato Fries, which were great at $3 and came in a little brown bag with a moroccan type yogurt sauce for dipping, and the Mac N Cheez with Beer Hots.  I loved the Mac N Cheez, but my friend wasn\'t crazy about the hot dogs in it.  The burger was by far the best deal, a huge burger and only $1 more than the 3 tiny little sloppy joe sliders.  We then ordered a round of Vodka/Sodas, and they didn\'t dissapoint.  Our total tab for 3 was around $46 before tip, so a pretty good deal.  DO get the burger and the sweet potato fries, but get a beer or a mixed drink instead of the white peach sangria."""""""\n'

aS"If you actually look at my reviews you will find that I have reviewed many local places and given them high marks.  This place is the exception.  Walking in and the bartender was coughing into his hands and touching pizza boxes with pizzas already in them and pouring drinks and touching receipts.  Disgusting.  The pizza itself was below average.  Decent crust but very few toppings and the sauce is done in their signature way where they put round dollops of sauce every so often on the crust instead of everywhere.  I'll take everywhere.  There was nothing but crust in several spots, bland as hell, and lame.  We were grossed out by the bartender and couldn't hardly eat anyways but we actually gave it a try.  I will never spend another dime in this location.\n"

aS"We were so excited to have another choice restaurant in North Central.  It has a great bar and patio, but I found the menu lacking.  I so wanted to love this place.  The hamburger I had was good, not great.  Did enjoy the fried okra, but found the mac and cheese dry and tasteless.   The wait staff was nonchalant and seemed to be more interested in each other than in waiting on tables.  Also, my daughter and her friends went there for a late dinner (they are all 24-26 years old).  They were carded but the waitress didn't believe them.  She sent the manager over who actually sat down at the table and had them each produce three more cards, which I thought was above and beyond.  After they had emptied their wallets, they did get their drinks, but the waitress, having been shown up, was rude to the girls after that.  It is a shame that this group of young women, who are all med students and law students, were subjected to this treatment and all have vowed never to return.\n"

Just like Titanic, we knew only half the passengers were going to make it. So we got as close to the front of the line as possible. We made it inside and grabbed a couple seats. The poor people opposite us had seats but couldn\'t sit down because plastic stacking chairs were stored there. They shouldn\'t use precious AC space for storage!\\nSoon after we shoved off they opened the front doors and hot, 107 degree air blasted through the cabin. Everyone was complaining but the crew said they had to circulate fresh air through because of the sterno candles used to keep the buffet food warm. There was nothing fresh about that air! \\nWe had punch cards, wrist bands, and tickets for drinks and food control. God forbid someone got an extra cup of soda.

aS"After reading all the reviews, I really expected more from this place.  Their pulled pork sandwich was not very good.  The meat was tough, and there was no smokey flavor whatsoever from the meat, just an incredibly sweet sauce with ketchup consistency that overpowered everything.  The other sauces on the table were just as bad.  The sides were pretty good, however.  I liked the blue cheese slaw and the cowboy beans, but sides are not enough for a BBQ place to stand on.  Normally, I like to visit a place several times and try multiple things from the menu before I can say whether I like it or not.  Because the pork was so bad, I'm reluctant to give this place another shot.  I'm from the South, and I haven't really found any place in AZ that can cook pulled pork properly (only Pork on a Fork comes close).  However, the pulled pork I had to day at the BBQ Co. was some of the worst I've had in the Phoenix area.\n"

aS"I'm trying the places close by my temporary Tempe home... it's tough to give more than two stars after my experience here.\\n\\nI walked by on my way to Food Town, and I picked up a menu.  In  perusing the offerings, I was struck by the Thai Basil Chicken combination. I figured with egg roll and Lo Mein, the combination would probably work.  After picking up the Food Town items, I walked toward Gourmet Wok.\\n\\nOn opening the door and walking in, I was the only customer in the restaurant.  When I passed by earlier, picking up the menu, there were no customers in the restaurant.  The only people in the restaurant were a waitress, her child and another lady at the same table.  The tables and chairs...Goodwill Industries.  The menu board...with lots of prices that have not been updated, even though the prices in the paper menu have...I thought I might have found the proverbial 'hole in the wall' for take-away Chinese cuisine.\\n\\nI compared prices between the picture board, the written menu on the wall and the paper menu in my hands.  The prices on certain items varied based on which source you ordered from.  My Thai Basil Chicken combination cost $6.55 based on the paper menu.  With tax, I paid $7.14.  The person who took my order advised I would wait 5 minutes and my order would be ready.\\n\\nI walked to the local literature distribution near the front door, where I picked up the coffee-time news.  After reading my horoscope and several articles about truffles, I was called to pick up my order.  3:20 on my watch.  This was either an extremely coordinated cook or certain items were cooked before being commingled with all the ingredients.  \\n\\nThe person who took my order brought the bag to the counter, handles looped through one-another.  I opened the bag, took a peek and everything looked appropriate.  I asked for some pepper oil, and was provided with a container.  Out the door and 2 blocks to the homestead...I walked in, unburdened from the trip, washed my hands and prepared to open the box for dinner.  \\n\\nThe egg roll...it had been sitting under a heat lamp...there were no grease spots on the envelope.  Cabbage, carrots, but no seasoning...frozen, not prepared fresh.  No Lo Mein...but rice cooked in yellow broth, and it was a little hard, like it could have cooked for 2 or 3 more minutes.  As hard as I tried, I just could not enjoy the rice, either.  \\n\\nLast but not least, the Thai Basil Chicken with no basil.  I'm betting the cook did not read the order, or chickie who took the order wrote down chicken with broccoli, because while there was no basil, the broccoli was in large quantity and cooked to perfection.  The chicken...no.  It must have been cut and then steamed and left in a tray in the preparation area.  The pieces were very uniform, very soft (beyond tender) and flavorless.  While I could not see what the cook was doing in preparation, my bet is that he took already prepared broccoli, carrots and onion and tossed 'em with the chicken pieces, then slathered the whole thing in sauce.  \\n\\nFirst time, not very impressed.  I will give them one more try, because every time I go by, the place is always empty.  Maybe if they get the chance to impress, and succeed, they could grow.\n"

Complete and \\Total\\"""" absence of anything even resembling Customer Service \\n2. Frustration at the a$$ backwards way the items are organized. \\n\\nTo the first point, I have NEVER been asked by ANY member of the staff \\""""Can I help you find anything today?\\"""" Even when I was shopping toward the front of the store, within sight of the cashiers who were just standing at their registers chatting to each other, and I was making a point of trying to flag someone down to answer a question, was I only met with a passing glance and a look of utter inconvenience. There were three cashiers, no on in-line, yet no one stepped forward or even acknowledged my existence. This was at the Desert Ridge location. \\n\\nAt the Camelback location just this passed weekend, I called ahead and spoke to Eric, inquiring as to whether they carried and had Abita or Dixie beer in-stock (it\'s the weekend before Mardi Gras and a week or so after the Super Bowl, so I figured Louisiana beer might be a bit slim on the ground, which is why I called ahead rather than drive all over town.) \\""""Oh yeah! I\'ve got several kinds of Abita in-stock\\"""" confirmed Eric. \\""""Great!\\"""" But what did I behold upon arriving not an hour later? No Abita. None. Only itty bitty \\""""Temporarily Out of Stock\\"""" slips on the shelf label. (You may want to make those signs a tad bigger, guys. Amongst the vast sea of labels that is the entire store, a Post-It-sized afterthought of an \\""""Out of Stock\\"""" sticker isn\'t exactly an eye-catcher). So I turned to the guy stocking shelves on the other side of the aisle (who had not acknowledged my existence) and asked him about the Abita. \\""""Um, uh, I dunno...I\'ll go check.\\"""" And so he disappeared, never to return or be heard from again.  Apparently he got distracted by the inconspicuous Post-its. \\n\\nThe other issue I have with Total Wine is it\'s lay-out. I was taught to read from Left to Right. Usually the Alphabet is also presented Left to Right. However, Total Wine has decided to turn the English-speaking world on it\'s ear and present it\'s stock \\""""Alphabetically\\"""" from Right to Left. W...T...F? Now, I understand that the customer, when walking through the store, starts at the front of the aisle and walks backward. This is the only reason I can see for putting the A\'s toward the front of the store and the Z\'s toward the back. Sure...I get it. But here\'s the thing: not only is it counter-intuitive to any customer who has been schooled in English grammar and the rules of Alphabetization, but it also allows your customers to walk only the front of the store if they are looking for any brand that starts with the first few letters of the alphabet. Why not put the A\'s all the way at the back where, not only will the customer be visually organize the selection reading from Left to Right, but also force the customer to walk past all the entire selection to get to products whose name starts with an \\""""A\\""""? I\'ll bet my Seghesio Zin that there are more breweries and vineyards whose names start with \\""""A\\"""" or \\""""B\\"""" than those that start with \\""""Y\\"""" or \\""""Z.\\"""" \\n\\nThere\'s a reason Costco puts the soda and the toilet paper at the very back of the store: it\'s so you have to walk past all the other product to get to it, thereby increasing the customer\'s likelihood of purchasing more than just the required toilet paper and soda pop."""""""\n'

So, I ran over to this shop, and instead of getting one or maybe even two tires I was told I needed ALL FOUR replaced!  I was in shock, as my son is a certified mechanic, and was at work, so I didn't have time to have him verify, but he would have warned his mother of this, if needed.  I agreed to this, feeling like I had no choice, and asked them to put one of the tires, which still had plenty of tread as my spare.  After all was said and done, I had paid a ridiculous amount, extra fees added to my quote, felt completely preyed upon as a woman there alone, and my spare had NOT been replaced as I asked.  I had been completely ripped off.  When I got home, my son was furious, as he said there is NO way all four of those tires needed to be replaced.  As I was on my way to a celebration of my grandchild, I did not have the energy or time to spend going back to fight this negative situation - rather, I will make sure and NOT EVER go there again, nor refer anyone!

As bad as the BBQ in Arizona usually is, this takes it to a new low ...  I wouldn't eat there for free ... Go yourself and notice that it is dripping grease from the moment they hand it to you .... Realize that once you eat that stuff you have no idea what kind of pain you can feel afterwords ....   Note: the service was better than expected ... very polite-nice girls ...

I guess a place that consistently has between an hour and 2 hour wait on a Saturday and doesn't take reservations has got to be beyond fabulous and worth waiting for right? You think? Wow..I am actually embarrased I fell for this. This must be what the people who bought Charlie Sheen tickets felt like...  Sucker! That is what I felt like last night for sure. First off, we had swung by here a couple of different Saturdays but (smartly) decided the wait wasn't worth it...my bf really wanted to try it ( be careful what you wish for)..so we got there (early for us) around 6:45 pm last night to put our name down and do the CRAZY hour and 30 minute waiting game...did I mention the bar area and patio are tiny and you get the added experience of being packed in like cows in an unorganic dairy farm....\\n\\nOk..so the food portion of the review...two words...mediocre and overrated...the guacamole was salty...i didn't get to see it prepared tableside because the restaurant was so crowded and small the server (who gets 4 personal stars because she was sweet)...literally couldn't fit the preparation cart anywhere near our table...our main dishes...were just ok.....nothing tasted particulary fantastic and the dining room felt hot with no air circulation...thank goodness for the wine....\\n\\nThis is probably one of the loudest restaurants I have ever been to...I was thinking no way will I be returning..that idea was more than cemented when we saw the glass damage...wtf?

Never in my life have I seen a line for a wave pool.  I typically think of the wave pool as a retreat from the lines.  Not at Sunsplash. The lazy river was so packed I could hardly see the \\river\\"""" part.  Not exactly a relaxing experience.  \\n\\nNot only that, but the water park seemed less than sanitary.  I saw several people with bloody noses, and I couldn\'t help but wonder when the last time they thoroughly sanitized the place.

If you plan to go on the big slides, be sure to bring your friends!  Expect to carry a massive raft up several flights of stairs.  There are no mechanisms that bring the empty rafts up to the slide entrance for customers.  I got a workout just by hauling our raft around!\\n\\nWhatever you do, do NOT open your water bottles prior to entering the park.  They will throw them out.  Bring a few gigantic bottles and rent a locker; a large cup of ice can be purchased at the concession stand for 25 cents.  Bring cash too.  A locker is $11, but you receive $5 back when you present your receipt with the locker key.  Also, I recommend bringing some plastic flip-flops.  There\'s nothing worse than tromping around dirty grounds covered with strangers\' hairs and other disgusting debris.  \\n\\nFood is quite pricey (no surprise here).

The waitress even apologized for the excessive wait time.\\n\\nThe food itself was ok.  I had chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, fruit and a muffin.  The muffin was applesauce something and was really good and huge.  The gravy was sort of thin.  None of the flavors stood out.

It was quick, the portions were extremely generous, and the Asian family that ran it was always friendly and acted like they were old friends whenever I'd drop by. \\n\\nUnfortunately the family that ran it is gone and the food has suffered for it. \\n\\nWhat was once a delectably spicy Cajun flavor on the blackened chicken, is now scaled back severely and is mild by comparision.  The garlic noodles were once actually garlicky are now just slippery and greasy. The Honey Lemon chicken is now overcooked and has lost nearly all of it's unique sweetness. The most egregious difference is that the new ownership has entirely removed the Cajun potatoes from the selection of sides available.\\n\\nIf I were to write this review a year ago, I would have agreed with the other review by W. It was a hidden gem in Arizona Mills mall. It's now just meh. I'm now looking for another spot to get my Cajun fix. Any suggestions?\n"

That being said today\'s experience was not a good one!  We arrived just before noon and there were few people there.  The employees were apparently  filling an order that seemed to be causing them some trouble and our food, once started, sat on the prep line for longer that it should have before they finished it.  I took two bites of my taco and the meat was refrigerator cold, not lukewarm from sitting on the counter too long.  I informed the manager and suggested that perhaps their warming trays were not operating properly and she checked and said everything was at targeted temperature.  I had her touch the meat in my taco to demonstrate that the meat was cold.  She agreed with me and said she would make me another.  15 minutes later, since my husband had finished his meal, I approached her and asked that my money be refunded.  She said she had totally forgotten about my taco and she couldn\'t refund my money because the cash register had frozen and she was trying to get someone on the phone.  Only after I stood there a moment did she offer a \\card\\"""" for the next time we visit.  I told her there wouldn\'t be a next time.

There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to \\stop harassing the fish.\\"""" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to \\""""harass\\"""" any fish.

I was really hungry and started out with the bruschetta and a watermelon agua. The drink was light and refreshing, not too sweet, and you can tell that they use fresh watermelon juice instead of that pucker crap. The bruschetta mix had a sweet taste to it that I didn't like but nothing that salt and pepper couldn't fix. My sister ordered the grinder and I ordered the pepperoni pizza because our waiter suggested it. I took a bite out of my sisters sandwich and it was very plain but the french fries were awesome.

I just knew this place replaced Julio too's (dating myself) and checked it out.  \\n\\nPretty much everything about my meal was poor.  All of the sides are either really bad impersonations of Korean sides, or corn straight out of the Del Monte can.  The seaweed used white vinegar, the cabbage was bland, and the clear noodle things were just not tasty.  \\n\\nI got a combo plate with BBQ chicken and the short ribs.  The short ribs were chewy with very tough fat on them.  They were not that good.  The BBQ chicken was not that good either and resembled slimy dark meat chicken that you find in a Panda Express rice bowl.  I guess the white rice was... white... and made of rice.  At least they didn't screw that part up.\\n\\nfor $10 I expect a much better meal.  I ate about half of it and threw the rest away.  I will never go back, and if you are someone that wants a lot of these flavors, go check out Cho Dang in Chandler.  It seems a lot of Paradise's (horribly ironic name) food is highly influenced by Korean food but poorly done.  You can get a better meal at a sit down place for less money at Cho Dang.  \\n\\n If you want food that rivals Samurai Sam's, Kyoto Bowl, or Panda Express than this is your place.  If you want decent food I suggest looking elsewhere.  I will be checking out the other Hawaiian joint around the corner to see if it is any better.  I am clueless on how this place averages 4 stars.

However it was very greasy and soaked the bread and made it slick...not good. The bread itself wasn\'t bad just generic rye you would buy on the shelf at any grocery. There also wasn\'t enough mustard on it or much meat probably double the bread to meat on a $9 sandwich. Compared to Chompies where its a nice thin slice of rye and piles of meat. Overall edible but not that enjoyable.\\n\\nNow the sides where I decided this place struck out like A-rod in the playoff\'s. I have never had potato salad that was so bland. I am normally not a huge fan of white potato salad but i do enjoy it. This was probably less exciting to my taste buds than a baked potato with no toppings. I tried dumping on pepper to no avail.

aS"The BF and I went here this morning after thinking about trying this place for awhile. Let me start by saying that in order to look at their menu online you need to download adobe reader and even then, no prices are listed. That was my first semi complaint, but I figured it would be good, so I shouldn't worry too much about that. So we got there at around noon and the place is cute, big patio and all. We were seated and got water from the very nice bus boy who works there. Our waiter came by and we both ordered coffee, I got the fire island eggs and the BF got the biscuits and gravy. When we got our coffee we were assured that the food would be out shortly. Well...I don't know what shortly means to them, but we waited a good 20 minutes or so for our food. Not so awesome. The BF's coffee was empty for about 10 minutes of this time with no offer to refill and no one around to ask. We get our food and mine was alright...it's chicken in a cream cheese semi spicy sauce on 'pizza' bread (kind of thick...not really crusty, but whatever). The flavor was just very one dimensional and the dish got boring after the first few bites....it was kind of too rich, which isn't something I would generally say. The BF's biscuits and gravy were not good. He said they tasted like a pizza hut meat lover's pizza. The biscuits were not light or flaky and the gravy was just one note...spicy. Plus, the gravy tasted the same as the potatoes that came with it (kind of like peppers)....so it was a big plate of one flavor, and not even a very good flavor. Additionally, and not necessarily the restaurant's fault, there were tons of flies around....they kept landing on our cups and it was somewhat annoying...maybe the trash needs to be taken out more often? Or maybe it's because people had their dogs at this restaurant, which I think is somewhat gross...I don't know, just not so pleasant. So the waiter comes by and takes the plates away and then we sit and wait...and wait...and wait for our check. I don't really understand this because I would think that he would have wanted the check as soon as possible, but maybe he knew he did a poor job and had given up on our table. Either way, after ten more minutes or so we got the check and paid cash to avoid the inevitable long wait if paying with a credit card. The total was 27$...that's pretty pricey considering the quality of this meal...feels like a waste of money to me. So if you like having all of your food taste like peppers and that's it and over paying for that experience....this is the place for you, otherwise, I'd say skip this place.\n"

So I recommend it for a business outing, which gets everyone excited. Drinks are fine, orders are taken and the guacamole begins to get prepared table side. As soon as we begin to dive into the guac, the soup arrives. One of our guests was in the restroom, and his soup was served while he was away. BAD, BAD waiter. Hot, cold, warm dish... whatever, you do not serve an empty seat. \\n\\nWhile enjoying our soup, entrees come out and were placed right next to our arms on sizzling hot plates. No one was even half way through their soup. I was furious and felt obligated to quickly shovel my soup so I could bring the dinner plate to my front and eat. \\n\\nOur waiter came over to clear the soup bowls and asked how dinner was and if he could bring anything. \\How about desert right now\\"""" I remarked, and unfortunately, he did not get the sarcasm. \\n\\nFood = 4 stars \\nService = 0 stars"""""""\n'

aS'How do I give NO stars? Ok, I get that it is Walmart and to some degree you have to just buck up and deal because it is going to be dirty, everyone who works there is going to by unhappy, etc. However, this Walmart hit a new Walmart low for me this week when I ordered a camera and storage card online to pick it up on this store. \\n\\nThe card was ready immediately, but the camera would not be ready for pickup for one week. No problem, except I received an e-mail that if I did not pickup the card with 48 hours the card would be put back on the shelf and I would be credited. So I called the store and politely explained that I would like to make only ONE trip to Walmart and asked if they could hold the card a few more days. Before I could finish, I was interrupted by a teenage boy manager and was told there was NO WAY they could hold it and that was policy, no exceptions. When I pressed him he told me I could not speak to the store manager and instead I should call walmart.com. Which I did, and they hung up on me. Awesome.\\n\\nBottom line: they were unhelpful and because I need the camera for work I kept the order. But that will be the last time I ever deal with Walmart.\n'

One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I\'ve had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn\'t believe that!\\nOn another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I\'ve ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn\'t allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me \\a very inhumane person\\"""" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn\'t let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).\\nBetween the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I\'m very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.\\nI have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!"""""""\n'

WOO HOO! 7 years later, that is... \\n\\nAlright, so the MAJOR issue I had with TMobile is either their phones or network suck! I don\'t care at this point to find out which one it was as I am happily back with Verizon. I got mislead a million times by customer service because they wanted me to stay with a windows based operating phone for some reason. Either way, something was not right and they couldn\'t resolve my issue over a 2 year span worth of my patience! That\'s ridiculous in itself! \\n\\nSo If you have a few minutes, I\'ll tell you all a little story. Go ahead, grab a snack and an ice cold refreshment and take a seat. I\'ll wait for you to get back... \\n\\n2 years ago I had a phone that was giving me problems. I had had that phone for about a year. After a couple of replacement phones, they recommended I upgrade; especially for what I mainly needed my phone for (I do Real Estate, need web access, etc.) and I needed to catch up with the times anyhow so I was cool with that. I ended up getting the most expensive phone they had at the time (HTC Touch Pro 2). Cool phone when it worked but I ended up going thru 5 master resets and 8 (YES, I SAID EIGHT!) replacement phones in one year! And the crappy part is, they had just come out with the HTC HD2 a month after I bought that phone and it was a million times better AND about $100 cheaper!!! Were they gonna tell me this?! NO! Would they let me swap phones because I was an awesome, very patient and one of their coolest customers? HELL NO!! I was stuck with a crappy phone and all the problems it had for over a year before I had to threaten to leave! FINALLY, they upgraded me to the HD2. And guess what??? Yep, again, you guessed it... After a month of trying it out, it started up again. The problems were continuing and they wanted to do the replacement thing. All the customer service people were astonished by the encyclopedia size notes that were noted on my account for the past 2+ years yet they can never manage to satisfy my cellular needs :( The Loyalty Dept (aka: Retention Dept) was the worst! Supposedly they have magical powers and can make things all better so that everyone\'s happy again! Nope, they would insult me with crappy offers that would make the average person wanna strangle their necks thru the phone! Not to mention that for the last few months I was with them, it would take (and this is no exaggeration) a minimal of 45 minutes on hold before I could get to someone! DID THEY KNOW I WAS CALLING AGAIN?!?!?! 45 effin minutes!!! MINIMUM!!! \\n\\nThe best solution they had was for me to upgrade AGAIN to a Android operating system (thanks for the late recommendation, 2 years later!) phone with a 2 year contract when I was on a month to month plan. With all the issues I was having and problems I went thru and inconveniences, etc, I voted against that thought. If I was to sign another contract, it was not going to be thru them!

aS'"""Gross. I-mart has now expanded to include a restaurant just a few doors down from the market. Wise decision, because the market part smells whack. It is pretty obvious and common knowledge that they cut their meat in the back of the store. I suppose the market and restaurant deserve their own review, but I think its the same rating, I\'ll just merge them.\\n\\nThe market has your basic Indo-Pak foods. Don\'t confuse the owner for an Indian or Paki though, he\'s from Bangladesh. He\'s an extremely nice guy, but I feel like every since he moved from Tempe, near ASU, his store has just lost substance. If you need to buy substantial amounts of halal meat I suggest you go elsewhere, probably Baiz Market would be a good idea. The meat here is very inconsistent. He\'s got your basic Shan masala amongst other odd brands. Of course he has asian rice and everything else you\'d really expect from this type of store. The mango juices he stocks are weird, but he has some Pakistani soda, Pakola. That\'s pretty cool.\\n\\nThe restaurant should be avoided. My fellow Indo-Pak friends rave about this place all the time, but I don\'t think they know any better. I walked in and the owner was taking orders... I was slightly confused and surprised (today was the first time I went to the restaurant). I thought to myself, \\Hey man, he\'s usually at the store cuttin\' my meat, what the heck is he doing here?\\"""" He must have made the food, because when he disappeared again he didn\'t reappear until my food was ready. My friends had bought me a tandoori chicken wrap, I\'m being very ungrateful, but it was not enjoyable at all. The naan was obviously microwaved a few seconds too long, because by the time I got to it it was like chewing on plastic. Taking bites out my \'wrap\' was just painful. I\'m sad because the filling was actually pretty good, but how can you overmicrowave naan to that point? It\'s like overmicrowaving your hotpocket (just follow the damn directions).\\n\\nThe owner clearly wants to retire soon, he first moved from the ASU location to a much smaller store, and now he is barely focusing on the store. To make things worse, he decided to open up a restaurant. If you could compare this place to a legit Indo-pak restaurant, it\'d be something like comparing Filiberto\'s to Chipotle.

I ordered a sausage, onion and greenpepper thin crust. My first clue that this experience was taking a turn for the worse was when the pizza arrived with the toppings on top of the cheese. Maybe that's why there was no taste. Not even the seasoned pepper's flakes could bring this pie to life. The sausage was nasty. In summary, Nello's was brutal.\n"

aS"Like all Fox restaurants (except the new Culinary Dropout at Scottsdale Waterfront), this resturant is just ok, but not great. Starting with the decor, the restaurant is light and airy, with huge windows and lots of patio seating, which is nice. However, the decor reminded me more of a yacht club in the Hamptons than a spot in Mexico. Another big plus is that the hostess (who was friendly and upbeat) gives you a white or black napkins, depending on what you're wearing. I know this seems like a small thing, but if you've ever been given a white napkin while wearing black pants, you'll know the anguish it causes.\\nTo the food: As I said above, the food is good not great, but like all Sam Fox restaurants, its overpriced. Its not offensively bad, but its not Arizona mexican. There is just no excuse for serving mediocre Mexican food in Arizona, and this is the reason why I would not recommend Blanco. There are tons of great places in this city to try for upscale Mexican food- Barrio Cafe, and Gallo Blanco are my favorites. The salsa was the worst offender. Serving salsa that tastes like Pace Picante canned salsa is not only unforgiveable, but sets the meal off on a bad foot.\\nTry again Sam Fox.\n"

Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\\n\\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\\n\\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\\n\\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\\n\\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \\n\\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.\n"

It is steaks and seafoods which are ok. with side dishes that are completely insulting.  They combine a bunch of fancy sounding stuff but the outcome is a barely palatable failure.  Their corn side dish was served semi cold and tastes like it has lemon in it.  Actually I think lemon is probably the secret in everything.  I have had cilantro lime roasted corn before and that was spectacular.  This lukewarm, not really roasted corn with lemon juice and maybe some olive oil or something on it was mediocre at best.  The flat iron steak was fine but not spectacular.  The kale side was sour and not good, also served fairly cool.  Their rolls were served hot and those were tasty though they would have been better off making the butter salted butter rather than sweet butter with huge salt chunks which were again just awkward.  \\n\\nI'm not trying to nit pick but truly when I say awkward, I'm trying to highlight how this combination of awkwardness makes the dining experience less than spectacular and came across as almost insulting.  As if the kind of people who stay at this kind of resort are so stupid that you can throw anything with a fancy name at them and they are supposed to rave about it.\n"

aS"I won't ever go back to this place!\\n\\nI was looking for a steakhouse to take my friend out for her birthday.  I wanted to take her to some place nice with good food.  My friend let me pick a spot so I said lets go to the Keg at Tempe Marketplace because we both drove by so many time but never tried it out.  \\n\\nWhy two stars? The first one is for the setting!  I love the look because it is soooo cozy- i felt warm right when i first got in.  The second star is for the clean/smell really good bathroom!  \\n\\nThe food:  besides the bread and butter- I got a New York and my friend got a Top Sirloin-  the New York was very salty and the Top Sirloin- well I can get a better steak at Apple Bee's.  \\n\\nThe service was ok- it was not bad nor superb.\n"

aS'I would never visit this location again. \\n\\nThere meat portions are horrible. It is like they are being paid to skimp on the meat serving. Each time I have gone, you have to order double meat just to get a full scoop. \\n\\nI like Chipotle, and this is convenient for me which is why I have gone, but after this most recent visit I will drive to a different location even if it is further for more quality.\\n\\nAlso, they are always backed up with a long line.\\n\\nI would recommend the Alma School location.

aS'"""So, I have been to Pearl a few times now. The first time, it was ok, nothing spectacular but I liked the prices. The 2nd time- horrible. The spicy tuna roll tasted very strong, like fish that was NOT fresh at all. The other rolls we got were falling apart. The service was crappy.\\nWelllll, I decided to give it another try because I had a certificate from restaurants.com for there. So, I grab 2 of my friends and we head that way. We sit down, one friend goes to the restroom. I am sitting with a friend from Chicago who has never been there so she has no idea what they are about. A girl walks over with the 3 menus they have (sushi, appetizers, and drink menus). This girl HAS TO BE either drunk or stoned... She asks if we have been there before and I let her know I had but my friend was new. She then says that she is just helping, not our waitress, and if our waitress doesn\'t explain the menu, I can....what???! So, she wants ME to explain the menu to my friend??? Weird. Anyway, finally our server comes, we order 2 miso soups and an edaname. The stoned girl who is \\helping\\"""" brings 1 soup and the edaname. I politely say that we had an extra soup when she had a chance...She then looks at me strangely and asks \\""""Did you order it with your server?\\""""....Really??? So, we order our food, one friend orders a beer. The beer comes out with ice in it?? The food comes....horrible. The fish is very strong again. I got yellowtail and it was very mushy and tasted suuuper fishy. My friend had a shrimp tempura roll that fell apart everytime she dipped in soy. I couldn\'t even eat mine... finally we want the bill. Server is no where to be found until we see her chatting with another table. Fine, thats her job to be friendly...15 minutes later we ask the bartender if we can get our tab and he acts like we are being jerks. Moral of the story...Pearl Sushi, I gave u 3 chances... thats enough. Get some fresh fish... I know your menu is cheap, but I\'d rather pay more for good fish. Also, get some servers who are a little more professional and experienced. And do some drug tests while you are at it."""""""\n'

aS"I walked in and I was immediately digusted by this place. Want a crap load of peanuts? No seriously, when you walk in there is a huge bushel of peanuts, and you can get as much as you want! Done with the shells? Just leave them on the table then brush them aside. The end result? A restaurant with peanut shells all over the place. Actually, to be quite honest, I'm being a little harsh here. I thought it was cool that they did this unlimited free peanuts thing, but it was like they were trying to compensate for something else.\\n\\nWell, when I got my food I figured out what they were trying to compensate for. The salad and 'breadsticks' were just plain bad. However, I didn't really expect much. I was actually hoping my wings would be good and that the salad was just a side. The wings are nothing special at all. I thought the 'El Hefe' wings were somewhat decent, but I don't think I could have more than a half-dozen of those. Hot wings? What hot wings? I thought I ordered some, but maybe the waiter got confused. I got some cold wings with red sauce on them, they tasted 'vinegary' and that's about all.\\n\\nTo be fair, the service was pretty good and the server was friendly. She was helping us make decisions since it was our first time, but the food was cold on multiple occasions. A previous reviewer mentioned gorgeous staff... Not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food, go to a strip club? Maybe if the food was hot it could be different, but I really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark.\\n\\nThere is really nothing special about this place. The wings are over priced for what you get, and there is better stuff available 5 minutes away from here. I love wings, and I've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in Phoenix, but I think my search continues for the time being.\n"

aS'"""This store is not very good. The only positive is that they have everything out for you to test and play with, and not locked behind glass. So, if you\'re in the market for a Sony product, you can go here and get the hands-on experience.\\n\\nHowever, the staff is completely inept. They do try to be nice, but they know nothing about computers. My wife was in the market for a Vaio laptop and had some basic questions to start, a couple of which the manager was able to answer, and most of which I had to find out myself by inspecting the laptops. We targeted the F series because my wife likes to play video games and to be portable. Once the manager got wind that she plays video games, he just kept repeating that they were running Starcraft 2 on one of the F series in the store, as if that\'s all we needed to hear to fork over $1300.\\n\\nWe decided to head up to the Microsoft Store to do some comparison shopping. They are very nice up there. They had the previous iteration of the F series in stock for $1000, and the specs appeared to be the same except for having 4 GB RAM compared to 6 GB on the newer model down in the Sony store.\\n\\nWe went back to Sony to verify what made up the $300 difference on their model, and the manager could not explain the price difference. It appears the newer one had only been redesigned, and had the aforementioned higher RAM. That\'s not worth $300 though. The manager referred me to another associate he referred to as \\the Vaio expert\\"""" and drifted away. I guess he\'d had enough of us and probably doesn\'t work on commission. I asked \\""""the Vaio guy\\"""" if the newer model had faster RAM or a faster RPM hard drive, and his eyes glazed over with ignorance. He said he would Google it for me, and I watched the painful process of someone Googling when they don\'t actually know what they\'re looking for. I finally thanked him for his time and asked some follow-up questions I thought he should know: Do they offer an educator discount? He doesn\'t know. He thinks maybe a student discount, but he doesn\'t know if and how much. Are any accessories included? He doesn\'t know. He doesn\'t think so. I fish for a free laptop case or free mouse or SOMETHING, practically coming right out and saying, \\""""I\'m giving you plenty of opportunities to sell me but you\'re not taking any of them, dipstick.\\""""\\n\\nNo dice.

Today my friend and I received neither. \\n\\nUpon arrival we sat immediately since we arrived before 8. We were \\greeted\\"""" by a server In about 1 min and asked if we were ready to order.  I stated we were not but drinks would be great.  We got our coffee within a few mins (which tasted fine). After that no sign of our server for 10 mins or so.  The table next to us was also looking to order from our MIA waitress.  She finally came over and took our order in a fast and courteous manner. The food arrived in about 15 mins but there was a problem......my friend\'s biscuits n gravy were barely room temperature.  After attempting to flag down the waitress for a few mins she walked by holding up her finger to let me know to wait min.  I don\'t know if she was being rude but it came across that way. After telling her the problem there was no apology and she walked away with his plate returning about 10 mins later with a hot plate of food. The food itself was good, but not great in any way. Our coffee cups went empty for long stretches of time and our waffle dogs had no crunch to them whatsoever.  After all that they give me the wrong bill which was about 5 bucks short of what we spent. After running my card they came back and asked for my card again and took about 15 mins to redo the bill and charge us 5 buck more. After the poor quality service I would figure they just let it slide since they made the mistake anyway and it was 5 bucks and not 20. \\n\\nI feel that there are many places that match the quality of the food at Over Easy and have much better service.  I will no longer eat there."""""""\n'

As far as my meal the corned beef beef hash was OK nothing special, the hash browns went from burnt on the edges to barely cooked in the middle, sausage gravy and biscuits were good but would of been a lot better had they been served hot. Everything else was just OK. Don\'t order the \\Almost World Famous Apple Pancakes\\"""" don\'t even call ahead (as they suggest) we ordered them knowing that they would take 30 minutes to prepare, so we all ate breakfast and sampled them after our meal.

aS"I will start by saying that I normally LOVE Pita Jungle, so it disappoints me to only give this Downtown location 2 stars.\\n\\nWith 2 kids (under 3) in tow, I was meeting my best friend for a quick lunch downtown. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and keep my kids happy. It took almost 15 minutes for a server to even acknowledge me - despite my telling the hostess after 10 minutes, and trying the flag down the server who kept going out of his way to ignore me. Finally I was able to flag down another waitress, and give her our full order, so that it would arrive by the time my friend got off work.\\n\\nThe lunch rush was over, so I didn't expect our food  to take longer than 15 minutes. We ordered a fruit salad (the Carribean), a Lavosh Chicken Schwarma Wrap, and a kids meal. THIRTY minutes had passed and our food was still not out. My friend literally had 10  minutes to eat before she had to be back in court.\\n\\nThe only thing they were quick about was taking my friend's credit card.\\n\\nThe 2 stars was because the food was delicious as usual, but this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant for lunch.

aS"I really hate giving places 1 star reviews, but in this case, it was very well deserved.  We came here around 10 or so and the place was pretty much full, and by full, I mean all 10 or so of their tables were occupied.  Fortunately, there were tables outside, so we grabbed one despite the clouds looming overhead.  \\n\\nWe sat there for a little while and enjoyed the cooler weather and perused the menus.  I was immediately turned off after noticing that almost everything on the menu contains onions.  Of course you can just ask for them to be removed, but for many people, they simply won't order something because of that.  We sat there for a while and the waitress finally came back to take our drink order, but specifically said we couldn't order our meal yet.  WTF, we're ready, and this is already taking long enough.  When she comes back out, entirely too much later, I ordered the starter which is two eggs, toast, and hashbrowns.  \\n\\nOnce our order was put in, we didn't see the waitress for another 30 minutes.  This is unacceptable for breakfast.  I was watching the window like a hawk and noticing the awfully slow rate at which food was going out to tables who were there well before we were.  The clouds decided to have some fun with us and began raining.  It got progressively worse until two of the outside tables went inside and stood, waiting for their food.  You'd think they would maybe expedite the food or something.  We stuck it out for about 5 more minutes and then gave up, realizing our food was never coming out.  We paid for the chocolate milk, and left.  The sad thing was, they didn't even do anything to rectify the situation.\\n\\nThis place is an absolute joke.  If you cannot handle the business you are receiving with the staff you have on hand, you need to hire more.  Not only that, but they need better servers.  The couldn't care less attitude of this place is pathetic.  I don't blame them one bit for the raining, and I certainly don't blame them one bit for being busy.  I do blame them for being careless and quite frankly, terrible at their jobs.\\n\\nI kid you not, we went next door to the Filiberto's and got breakfast in less time than it took for us to even get our drinks.

After talking to them specifically about the type of dog we have (a Pitbull) and that many management companies don't accept them, we were assured that was not an issue with the property we were looking at. Even their own website said on that property listing (and others) there were no breed restrictions. However after turning in our non refundable app fee, they stated that due to the breed of our dog we were not able to obtain the house...They refused to refund the app fee (due to it not being refundable) even though they were in the wrong here...they told us before we applied that the dog was no issue..Also not only did they refuse to refund the app fee they didn't even offer to use the files or app fee we paid towards another property application.

aS'"""Rather disappointed. Was looking forward to going here on a Saturday Night as we were meeting a group old friends and had never been. Heard good things about the joint and had watched the review on PBS some time ago. \\n\\nFirst off, the bartender needs to learn some social skills, as well as, a refresher on some of the basics. Sat down and took over 5 minutes to greet us - there were total of 5 people at the bar. Gave us a drink menu then took a full 10 minutes to come back. Really? Wasn\'t like he was doing anything important, just casually chatting with some customers while we wait dry and parched. Sorry to interrupt your conversation but Alcohol sales are waiting over here sir! He wasn\'t fully knowledgeable about the liquors the establishment offers either. How about a cocktail napkin for the sweaty beer - they were 6 inches from where he set the glass down. In fact no one had cocktail napkins; just plain lazy. He never checked back with us either or asked for food sales. I had to flag him down to order appetizers. Never came back either, we ended up just leaving and going to the table. I hate that \\Scottsdale Bartender\\"""" mentality of it seemingly being a favor to serve you. Don\'t flatter yourself lazy bar-keep. \\n\\nThe wait staff is mature and knowledgeable. Out gal was quirky and funny - we liked her personality. She dropped the ball a few times on beverage service though. Thirsty 12-top of people waiting for drinks decreases your sales and inevitably your tip as the check is smaller. Big hint: Six chicks at the table, you might want to suggest desserts as they WILL order them, but won\'t if not asked. \\n\\nFOOD:\\n\\nStarted with Hummus app and pot-stickers. Nothing to write home about and presentation was plain generic. Pot-stickers were on the cold side too. \\n\\nI ordered a Caesar salad sans the croutons with extra dressing and extra cheese. Came out w/o the extras and was quite dry. Had to ask for more dressing which was brought out. This might be picky but I like my Caesar tossed so it\'s even and not dressing poured over the top. The big kicker for me was the abundance of giant leafy romaine tops. A Caesar should be the hearts of romaine and chopped - not the other end of the leafy bush as it\'s too bitter. It was not enjoyed. \\n\\nI ordered prime rib since we\'re in a steak house right. Ordered it MEDIUM RARE. MR should be red with some blood. The server dropped my plate and ran before comment so I sat there looking at a piece of Medium Well shoe leather. With that said, the 12 dinners came out wildly staggered and auctioned off at the table - real bush league. How difficult are table/seat numbers. \\""""Who has the Sole? Who has the Steak?\\"""" is so unrefined. Some of the guys at the table were served before their wives and then were patiently waiting to eat until their partner\'s meal arrived - result cold food. Others were finished with their meal before others even got their entrees. The table service as a whole was disconnected and awkward.  \\n\\nAnyhow, I had to send back the prime rib as I don\'t eat shoe leather; especially for like $30 something bucks. It came back and it was MEDIUM not MEDIUM RARE. I\'m not one for the double send back as you don\'t know what might be brought back the third time if you know what I mean. So I pained through it, and pained I did as this Prime Rib was super bland - really disappointing. In fact all of the food was rather bland and in need of seasoning. One other item was a side of this couscous thingy that sounded interesting. It wasn\'t - it was awful. Crunchy and tasted odd. Now with that said, it very well may be the correct way to prepare this, I don\'t know, but it tasted like eating raw rice to me. \\n\\nNo coffee or dessert were offered. I would have ordered a Grand Marnier or a Sambucca if asked as well. \\n\\nWhat a tasteless train-wreck. I can think of a ton of other places to drop $140.00 in this part of town."""""""\n'

Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.  \\n\\nOnce you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.  \\n\\nFinally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.  \\n\\nThey feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.

I asked for the burger itself to be cooked well, no pink.  Well, it wasn't.  It arrived medium well.  The special requests I made were followed except for the cooking temperature.  No fast food burger should be served pink unless requested.  Blech.\\n\\nThe fries that I have heard folks rave about were just awful for me.  Mine were served room temperature, barely warm.  Greasy, flavorless, and soggy.  Yuk and double yuk.  \\n\\nMy granddaughter ordered a strawberry shake.  Something happened to the shake machine and they had a terrible time making that little cup of ice cream and milk for her.  When it was finally served, there was way too much strawberry sauce in the drink.  It was horrid.  \\n\\nI won't go back again because the food was not impressive and neither was the service, despite the many many people working.  The prices were very fair.\n"

aS"We came here on a Friday night with high hopes with great recommendations from friends. Can we say very limited menu? Looking at the prices, I was expecting a more seasonal selection. Our server took forever to greet us. She barely even knew what the daily specials were! We heard the server at the next table list a couple of specials that our server had no idea about. Umm yeah had to pass on the 32 dollar strip steak special. Had the french dip (17 dollars), which was pretty good. The string like fries were tasty, just a bit salty. For the price and poor service, won't be going back.\n"

Thanks for these steps. The thing is I turn all my devices off regularly - probably 2 or 3 times a day - so they\'re constantly resetting like what you\'re saying to do in these instructions. And since I have ethernet, only the first 2 steps apply to me, and like I said, they\'re done on a regular basis, so...although you guys are quick with an answer, I still don\'t believe it\'s an adequate one to explain why I, with a premium package from my ISP, 13 mbps download speed, and comparatively little trouble streaming video on most other sites, e.g. YouTube, Digg, Hulu, etc., still continue to have problems loading content on your site.\\n\\nSince May, I can only successfully watch an entire movie without major interruption approx. 25% of the time. Maybe I should be paying 25% of my monthly bill? Perhaps you guys think we pay relatively little for the great service - and, in essence it is great, or was, for my first few months as a customer. And now, to hear you guys are jacking up your rates, when I\'m DEFINITELY not getting what I pay for, I think sucks the big one. I\'ve also had several DVDs that have skipped and been unwatchable also, so here\'s an idea coming from someone in business development and marketing:\\n\\n - Skip raising your rates and focus on customer satisfaction first\\n-  Hire more (or better) people for DVD inspection/quality control/tech support\\n-  Use the billions you must be raking in and get more servers/DVDs to ensure the quality you purport to have\\n\\nThen you won\'t take a huge tumble when rate jacking and thumbing your nose at customers causes them to jump ship by the millions in the months and years to come.

If you want , Skip to the last paragraph to spoil the story and find out what to expect when dealing with them.\\n\\nMy Experience\\n\\nI had brought my scooter in for a new intake , as mine had just fallen off while driving around town. I didn\'t think it was a big deal because I knew Performance Scooter was just down the road. \\nI putted in and explained my situation to them.  I wanted to know my options. The guy working there told me my scooter was just a pile of crap , and I should buy one of his. And there was really only one option , a cheap knock off K and N filter that they will connect to a piece of rubber they chopped off some other intake that was laying around. For $80.00 installed. I thought this was a good deal , considering any mechanic knows if you change an intake on a motor you will have affected the air fuel mixture , and thus will need to jet the carburetor. I didn\'t want to spend the time jetting the carb my self , as it would be my first time for this carb/motor and I didn\'t have a good baseline to start. Also I had to be to work in about 1.5 hours. I accepted the deal.\\n  The guy working there told me he had just crashed pretty hard on a scooter and had broken some ribs. So he needed me to install the intake , because he could hardly move. I bolted on the parts he had given me.\\n\\There! Its going to run much better , and way faster now!\\""""  The man said.\\n\\""""What about all these disconnected , lose , vacuum lines that are just dangling now? What about the jetting?

I used to be able to reach 70mph , and now its topping out at 35 , and its taking forever to even get to 35. I got to work late. That evening after work the scooter would not start.\\nI called a friend and trucked the scooter home. In the morning the scooter still would not start. I trucked the scooter back to Performance Scooter. They told me they would look at it and get back to me. \\n5 days later they called and said \\n\\""""I don\'t know how much money you wanna put into this thing, but you can just buy a new one from me. Otherwise you are looking at $400.00 and I don\'t even know if that is going to fix it.\\"""" \\nI told him screw it. Leave it outside and ill pick it up when i get off work.

aS"Let's just say I felt a little mislead with the business description. We were looking for a hookah lounge that offered a full bar and a patio, when we got there we saw they had a nice patio with comfortable looking chairs however, as for the bar......they did in fact have one.... in the restaurant next door!!! We ended up sitting on the patio of the restaurant (which was very small and lacking any sort of ambience we hoped for) since that was the only place where we could both smoke hookah and enjoy drinks from the bar. The drinks were very over priced at $9 for a Vodka/Cran ( I mean I would expect this from a Scottsdale club). The one brightside to this experience was we found out the restaurant we were sitting at served excellent hummus... We definitely won't be going back for hookah anytime soon however it is possible we will come back to try more of the food.\n"

aS"This is a very cute place--it's clearly not a chain-restaurant type of place that seems to be so frequent here in Scottsdale.  My wife and I sat outside for dinner this past Saturday night, and with the heat lamp, it was perfectly comfortable.    We really liked the environment--the faux candles (which seriously looked really nice), the flowers, the fire, etc.  \\n\\nThe food, however, leaves much to be desired.  \\n\\nI had the mussels, which I found to be not very fresh. Sure, we're miles from the coast, but even in California, we get mussels in from Prince Edward Island, so I just think these were a bit old or worse, not even live.  The broth was tasty, but a bit ruined by the really fishy taste that comes from less than highly fresh seafood.   My wife had the foie gras--overall, it was quite good, but slightly overcooked.  \\n\\nFor the main course, i had the lamb. I had requested medium rare, and it came back well done--there wasn't a bit of pink in the center anywhere...this was a bit disappointing--a french restaurant that had the temperature way off.  So, i sent it back, and this time, just to be safe, i asked for it to be RARE.  And the second time, there were two pieces of lamb--one piece was cooked rare, but still cold in the middle (so i suspect it was from the fridge before they cooked it), and the other piece was well done again!   It was a bit bizarre and straight out of a Gordon Ramsey Kitchen Nightmares episode.  I mean, seriously, if you've blown it in the kitchen the first time, wouldn't you show a bit more care the 2nd round?!  Use a thermometer like the rest of us!  And to top it off, they didn't even take the lamb off the bill.  Granted, they gave us a free dessert, but in retrospect, a much classier move would have been to take it off the bill, ensure the manager personally apologized AND offer free dessert.  \\n\\nThis is one of the first times that Yelp has let me down--an average of 4.5 stars usually guarantees something great.  In this case, it wasn't even close.  \\n\\nDon't even get me started about the wine...and the server's recommendation.\n"

The dough tasted like play-dough....salty as hell, undercooked and kinda slimy/sludgy in the middle.The toppings (wife had cinnamon and I had green chili chicken) and the mild salsa were the only reasons I could eat a few bites. I ended up scraping it off and throwing out the fry bread. The price was about avg but still not worth the taste. I dont think we will try it again. Sad day.\n'

aS"I had heard good things about this place in passing and so purchased a Groupon to try it out. So the 5 wine tasting and an appetizer for two.  We arrive aroung 5:30 on a Thursday night and again the place is empty, so you'd think we'd have no trouble getting good service. Wrong!  Three people working and no eye contact. Our server didn't offer any comments on the wines we chose- like what it might pair with, where the grapes were sourced, any charecteristics it had... I'm not a wine snob but I have done many a wine tasting and you usually get some sort of interaction from the person pouring and some information on what your tasting. She did mention how much she liked the goat chesse and cinnamon stuffed dates but that ended our conversation except for one word answers to our questions.  She even left before we were through our tasting and didn't tell us or the next server...ugh.\\n\\nWe ended up purchasing an additional appetizer, (warm brie served with Triscuts, seriously?) so we planned on spending money...might have even bought a glass of wine after the tasting had the service or atmosphere been inviting. I will not be back for any reason.  If they can't serve 2 people at the bar properly how can they do big wine making parties right?\n"

The meat tasted like it was just taken out of the freezer and nuked in the microwave. The Pita bread was stale and when I attempted to fold it and take a bite it broke and everything fell out (goody gum drops).  \\n\\nI understand that a Gyro is not a common dish that every restaurant can prepare with perfection, but don't put it on your menu if you can't make it. It's like an auto repair shop that also does manicures, just don't do it! \\n\\n2nd time: \\n\\nI decided to give this place another chance and the end result was I me being out 20 bucks and extremely disappointed yet again. I ordered a simple chicken sandwich and it tasted like cardboard. I was certain that they could not mess up a chicken sandwich and they did.

aS"I feel kind of bad giving out my first 1-star review, but hopefully I'll go back and give it another review.  I got a menu from this place in some flier and it's been on my fridge taunting me for the past week or so.  I finally got the pizza craving, and it was conveniently on a Friday when Rosati's offers double coupons, turning a $5 off an order of $20 or more into $10 off.  Definitely not bad, because I think they're a little over-priced and without the coupon/double coupon incentive wouldn't go back.\\nAnyway, I wasn't surprised that we weren't the only ones wanting pizza on a Friday and had no problem with the 1 hour delivery time quoted for my pizza and salad.  An hour and a half later, the guy shows up with the pizza and no salad.  He won't just say screw it to the salad and adjust the bill because then we're under the necessary $20 mark for the coupon, but he says he'll be right back and it won't take nearly as long as the pizza did.  We settled into the pizza, which turned out to be cold around the edges and lukewarm in the middle, and really soggy.  Not soggy like the thin crust was buckling under the weight of the toppings (though probably that too), but soggy like the crust was sitting under wet toppings for way too long and it just turned into mush.  Still, it was fairly tasty for cold and soggy and I could see the potential for a decent pizza.  After 45 minutes there's no salad so we call and ask if it could just be canceled.  She says he's already on the way, so no, but offers us coupons.  I'm guessing more coupons that just came with the pizza.  we explain the shiteous experience and she doesn't sound surprised but doesn't offer to right the situation in anyway either.  Finally the guy came with the salad a little over an hour after his first visit and just under 3 hours after we ordered.  We weren't hungry at that point, but I had the salad the next day for lunch, with leftover pizza crisped up in the oven.  Both were decent.\\nI emailed Rosati's with what I wrote here because I'm honestly not used to this crappy of service.  If they contact me, I'll try them again and redo this review.  If you're reading this, I guess they haven't yet.\\nBottom line:  Probably good pizza, but there's a catch-22 of being overpriced without coupons and overly busy when coupons are offered.  My advice would be to order in or carry out.\n"

The food is always.... uneventful.  It's not one of those specifically great or specifically bad ones.  It's just..... fine?  The only really good thing I got there once was their big breakfast.

Mine was almost sent back (now that I think about it I should have) because it was very tough and that after being served sliced. My wife said hers was tender.

aS"I dig hitting farmers markets once in a while to get some great locally grown produce and other stuff that's good for you but then also other crap which I probably don't really need to eat but I go to these things all starving and end up eating anyway, because I'm a growing boy. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I hadn't been to a farmers market in Phoenix until last week, even though I live close to the Town  and  Country Shopping Center (with the Trader Joe's, Bookstar, Chili's, etc.).

There were 10 tables at most, with only one guy selling a handful of produce (the tomatoes here weren't looking so hot). The other tables were selling anything from handicrafts to healing workshops to homemade jars of salsa and jalapeno jelly. Which is totally cool, but I thought the main anchoring businesses of a farmers market were the produce growers, of which there were barely any in sight. And there were only  a small handful of other people milling around. Not a lot of foot traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, pretty underwhelming. I'm not knocking the sellers at all who were there (all really nice) or the goods they were selling, but I was expecting way more out of it. Maybe I was there on an off-week, because I barely saw anything that resembled this farmers market in the video on the link.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'd say check out this farmers market if you happen to be in the area during midday on Wednesdays, but don't go out of your way to be there.

One that also comes with chip and a side dish (I opted for the fruit salad.) for a reasonable $6.95. The limeade also looked yummy, so I got that, too. While I did have to drive about 20 minutes back to my office, I still believe that this meal would have stunk even if I sat down and ate it on the spot. The bread was burnt, the cheese was American - blech! (even though I see now, I get a choice of cheese instead of all the cheese listed, I wasn't asked.), and the fruit salad was all green apples. Excuse me, one piece of pineapple. The only thing that saves this place from one star is the limeade. And even that could have been less sweet. Skip this place.

aS'"""When Trusty Pal Mikey mentioned that this place had won Best Fish in Chips in the Valley at some point in the recent past, it was time to jump into the car and head on downtown for sustenance. \\n\\nArriving at the restaurant was kind of anti-climatic as on a Monday night during football there didn\'t seem to be a lot going on (except for a pretty cool DirecTV trailer showing the game which was a nice touch)\\n\\nThere were several tables of mostly intoxicated patrons, to be expected of a bar/pub during a sporting event but the guy sitting ON the table next to ours stretched out in Cincinnati Bengals gear should probably have been asked to call it a night.\\n\\nIt took a while to get a server to clean some unidentified stickiness off of our table, bring menus and take a drink order and about then the table next to ours got LOUDER w/the addition of an off-duty server (confirmed by asking our server) wearing a Rose  and  Crown shirt and another woman identified as \\the girlfriend of one of the owners.\\""""\\n\\nLoud, rowdy, employees enthusiastically dropping F-bombs didn\'t make for the best dining atmosphere.  Fail there.\\n\\nThen the starters arrived...The Sausage roll was mostly cold, the puff pastry which should have been light and flakey was gooey and undercooked although the pickle relish condiment was delicious.\\n\\nThe Scotch egg was served cold (the server confirmed this was as intended) which seemed odd to me as I\'ve always had them hot (the British version), the flavor was good but the texture of cold sausage just didn\'t work for me (this is a personal preference not a knock on their version).\\n\\nThe Fish  and  Chips Main arrived and I must say, the Chips were superb, well cooked and just the right size.  Then things went a bit pear shaped.  The fish, while piping hot was EXTREMELY greasy and devoid of seasoning.  Luckily the homemade tartar sauce was tasty (though the size of the pickles prevented dipping). \\n\\nI LOVE a good order of Fish and Chips but was sadly underwhelmed by the offering here and was forced to grab something on the way home to satisfy my hunger.\\n\\n(note:  The table next to us was joined by a patrons Dalmatian and even though we were on the patio, there are just some places that just aren\'t appropriate for the little furry people.

They are always really, really smelly and warm.\\n\\nI like that there are outlet stores, so you can save a lot of money, but at the same time some of the stores they have are really ghetto and a lot of the outlets have ghetto items.\\n\\nThe mall is always really packed and there are a ton of kids running around. People walk on the wrong side of the mall, or walk in large groups that prevent people from getting by.\\n\\nAnd the worst part: there are at least ten different cell phone kiosks and you get badgered every time you walk by.

Now imagine that you get home with this treat, only to pull it out of the bag and realize that they have given you blueberry donuts instead.  Now I'm not a donut specialist like the employees at DD are, I'm an average gal with no donut training but I knew immediately upon seeing this donut that it was blueberry.  How did I do this you ask?  The donut was blue and blue = blueberry, blue does not = plain.  Sadly, todays disappointment sums up this DD location.  I'd like a latte please, here's your regular coffee miss.  1 biscuit please, here's your bagel lady.  I'm tolerant when it comes to the occasional mistake but this location always manages to screw up at least one thing with every order.  The food is generally pretty good, you just may not get what you ordered.  Today was the last straw for me, I caught todays coffee mistake but failed to look in the donut bag.  I have no personal vendetta against blueberries but a blueberry donut is like a raisin bagel - wrong.\n"

aS"Good pizza places that deliver are hard to come by, or maybe I've become a Pizza snob, I'll have to check my wallet for a membership card.  Well this was a recommendation from a friend and we were in the mood for pizza, so we ordered up a House Special.  We were told that it would be 45 minutes before we'd have it, pretty standard and generally this is an under-promise over deliver type thing.  This is where we started off on the wrong foot.  I called an hour later to get a status of the pizza, it was out for delivery.  An hour and 10 minutes after placing the order we had it in our hands.  And I have to say, even if they did deliver on time, I don't think I would be ordering from them anytime soon, it just wasn't all that great, everything was pretty bland.

We were tired and starving so we sat down anyway after they promised to have it cleaned straight away.\\n\\n20 minutes later, nobody had offered to take our drink order, but we managed to get someone to take most of the disgusting plates off of our table. We had asked a few people to send someone out to take our order and the table next to us that had been seated after us had gotten menus and drinks. \\n\\nThey must've not understood that we were new customers even though the hostess knew, the waiter whos section it was new, and the bus boy and bartender both knew as well because we told them.

We said no and that we were leaving and he flipped out. He said he wasn't on the clock so he couldn't help us, but he would try to flag someone down immediately.\\n\\nIn the end, the place smelled very fishy (which you should know is a bad sign when eating at a fish restaurant - especially sushi) and we decided to just split and get food elsewhere. Between the fishy smell and the non service, there wasn't much keeping us there.\\n\\nThe place looked kinda nice and I'm sure we just had an isolated experience - but until I actually try again and get some food and service, this will have to be my review - one star.

We were celebrating a birthday, so the menus had the birthday girl's name printed on them, and we appreciated the nice touch. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in our decision-making. \\n\\nThe only problem was the food! We got the mussels, scallops, and hamachi for starters, and the mussels were so fishy to me. I loved the scallops, and the hamachi was just average - not the wow factor I was hoping for with such a pricy dish. Then the entrees came, and I was really disappointed with my pan-seared turbot. The spaghetti squash was drowning in this uber-rich cream sauce, and the fish was greasy and overcooked. My family also complained about their orders - all of them said their food was really (really!) salty, and my dad even had trouble finishing his because his tongue was burning from the salt. He has a high tolerance for salt, so I was really surprised! For the prices we paid, I expected much more delicate, thoughtfully seasoned food.\\n\\nThen we ordered dessert - banana creme pie, black and white (flourless chocolate cake), and creme brulee to share. The brulee was good, but the pie and cake were nothing to write home about and definitely not worth the price.\\n\\nOverall, I'm glad I went to Cork to experience the atmosphere and get the special occasion vibe, but I probably wouldn't go back for the food unless the prices go down!\n"

In fact I was put off the restaurant as a whole due to a recent experience. The last time I ordered the Nicoise salad with Salmon the potatoes were stale! And by stale I mean noticably shriveled and inside/to taste 100% stale. Given they are a main component of the salad I mentioned it to the waiter when he asked how my meal was. He seemed surprised that I would say anything other than, 'yes it's good thanks' and my response literally caught him off balance... 'I'll mention it to the chef', he said. A few minutes later the waiter returned and thanked me. Erm for what? Telling you the potatoes were stale? There was no offer to replace or sub the  potatoes. In all honesty I didn't really care - I was on a lunch break and it was more important for me to eat within the time I had available... About 5 minutes passed and a lady sitting at the bar ordered the same Nicoise salad. I watched with interest as it was placed in front of her curious as to whether they had subbed the stale potatoes. A few minutes later on a return run to the kitchen I overheard the waiter remark to the chef, 'we've got to dump those potatoes, she's the third person we've had today picking them out and leaving them aside...' So they knew about the issue before I reported it and served me, then after I complained they served them to another customer. My check arrive - there was no mention of the potatoes or any adjustment to the check. I'm done going to Petite Mason - but I'm not done telling this story to everyone I meet!!!\n"

We started with a special that was calamari fritters and the Calamari should have been chopped because they were incredibly tough.  We then had another small plate with eggplant, bacon and can't remember what else...OK... but not something we would rave about.  Then we moved on to the warm duck salad.  It was bland, with the exception of the duck.  The duck breast did have a nice flavor, but that didn't compensate for the lack of flavor of the grilled lettuce leaves.  It had interesting ingredients, but didn't feel they melded together.  The white fish with the variety of mushrooms was the best thing we had.  The mushrooms were outstanding.  We did have the clams with bok choy or cabbage and bacon.  I thought it was good, but my husband ate just one clam and it was not as fresh as we anticipated, so I had the remaining  clams and thought they were o.k.  All in all, we have eaten at other Japanese restaurants,  and for us, this was not a stand out and the likelihood  that we would return for  a second chance seem improbable.  Sorry! \\n By the way, the servers were very good at explaining everything and brought our dishes out timely, not rushing us, but not taking forever, either.

aS'"""Okay, I wasn\'t too crazy about this place.  I read some reviews on here saying that it was a great place to take out-of-town guests so I went ahead and took a visitor there a few days ago.  The day we went up there happened to be very chilly, with quite the bracing wind.  So when we first sat down to lunch at the \\Mammoth Steakhouse,\\"""" we were expecting a nice, heated area to enjoy our good eats.  Well, there was to be no heat whatsoever.  All they had to keep the place warm was human body heat and tiny, tiny space heaters.  It also seemed like the place was understaffed, with one waiter to serve a large room of customers.  I ordered the Mammoth burger, which was tasty, but unfortunately it and the fries got cold a little too prematurely, on account of the FRIGID environs.\\n\\nWe then made our way over to a few shops here and there.  I was impressed with one or two, but the rest was very overdone and kitschy (I think that\'s how that\'s spelled).  One store had a bunch of clay magnets, pottery, and figurines you could buy from a lady who was making them only for fun and not money (all the money you gave her went to the \\""""town\\"""").  After we bought a few magnets, we got crazy at a store called \\""""Cactus Flats.\\""""  Now, if you\'re into cultivating plants, but are shitty at watering them enough, this is the place for you!  The lady there sells both cacti and succulents.  The succulents can be \\""""sprinkled\\"""" once a week and the cacti need only a tbsp of water a month!  And the plants sold there are really gorgeous.  Never did I realize how many species of cacti and succulents there were!  I went a little crazy and bought six plants.  However, most of them are affordable at only $4 each.  \\n\\nThen, we decided to buy a \\""""train\\"""" ticket.  \\""""Train\\"""" tickets cost 12 bucks for an adult and this thing only goes around the town once while some tour-guide (who probably despises his job) tells you random facts about the town, mining, and the lives of the surrounding Saguaro cacti.  Big freakin\' whoop.  Twelve bucks down the drain.  \\n\\nNext was the \\""""mine\\"""" tour.  This consisted of an over-dramatized elevator ride down a \\""""shaft\\"""" and a walk-through of a FAKE mine.  You know it\'s fake as soon as you see that the rocks in there are made of PLASTIC.  There I was thinking I was going to take a trip down a real-live, historic mine.  It could have been redeemed if the tour guide was a decent-enough speaker.  If I didn\'t know any better, I would have been convinced our poor tour guide was drunk.  His pauses were long and way overdone and you could tell that he, too, probably despised his job.  I could have sworn I sensed a drunken slur here and there, but he didn\'t smell like alcohol, so I trusted he was okay.  Either way, he was a shitty orator.  \\n\\nOnce we got outta there, we went to a \\""""Cantina\\"""" in order to get a good hot chocolate.  That was also a bust.  I was expecting a good, genuine mug of hot chocolate.  Nope.  Alls we got for 3 bucks each were tiny styrofoam cups and shitty machine-generated hot chocolate (the kind that comes out right next to the French Vanilla cappucino flavor).  \\n\\nMy friend was a doll and said she loved it, but I knew that place could have been way better.  They advertise it as a ghost town, but all it is is just a bunch of reconstructed buildings put up to resemble the previous town that was located there.

aS"I would love to give a sterling 5-star review for Carly's - I love the atmosphere, the dcor (hand-drawn cartoons on the tables were awesome), the artsy vibe and the location - but I just can't. \\n\\nThe first time I came, it was off an extended happy hour at the Roosevelt - which is conveniently within walking distance. A friend ordered the hummus and flatbread, which to my starved being were the most delicious I had ever tasted. I also drunkenly ordered an organic-vodka martini - the last thing I needed was a martini! - that tasted, as I recall, OK.\\n\\n it was after another happy hour visit to the Roosevelt that I returned to Carly's with visions of that luscious hummus and Plaid-like vibe dancing in my head, and making my mouth drool. Of a much more sober disposition, I actually studied the menu and was severely shocked. \\n\\nFirst, the prices. $7+ for a Stella? What the hell? And that dubious organic martini - it wasn't on the menu...did I imagine that? - Well, any martini was $10-12 ?! Is this Durant's? It definitely wasn't THAT good of a martini. \\n\\nI quickly found my hummus/pita app. and ordered a large portion, growing decidedly more disappointed/heartbroken with the entre options. Nothing, and I mean nothing, sounded even remotely appetizing. It was all very rich yet bland-sounding. Does that make sense? Like brie and turkey on Panini bread... Eh, ok. I was hoping it would be like Roosevelt, where you order the grilled cheese and tomato soup with reservation, and then are blown away. Sad to report - not so.\\n\\nHowever, I was a huge fan of the veggie chips that came with our hummus and flatbread (which, thank god, was as delicious as I kind-of-remembered). No problems with the service, but from the rest of the reviews, it sounds EXACTLY like Plaid, except downtown...and with a way less-tasty menu.\\n\\nSo, $50 later, we'd had a mediocre couple of entrees, an appetizer, no buzz and some leftovers that are still sitting in my fridge a week later. Do'h! \\n\\nthat really sucks, because I think they have the foundation for a restaurant I would adore and go out of my way to go to and want to support - extensive beer selection, great ambiance, perfect location, local ownership - Please Carly's, can I petition for some better quality/more adventurous food options? I'll even then pay for the overpriced beer without complaint.\\n\\n*Editor's Note : Seriously, does anyone else think the beer purchased at Tops is always about 7 degrees too warm? It's cool enough to drink, but warm enough to not be refreshing, and it drives me crazy. \\n\\nAnd, hang on, I'm not done: What the hell makes a martini organic anyway? Non-pesticide-infused, no-hormones-added-potatoes for the vodka?   ...Highly dubious, indeed.\n"

To begin my dining experience, I found the darkness in the pub to be overwhelming (a word I\'d rather use in this context is \\oppressing,\\"""" but I\'m trying to lighten up!).  I wouldn\'t have minded so much (as I could\'ve sat closer to the door left ajar, which allowed light to come in), but then the music blaring out of the speakers overhead was just too much!  To compound the situation, the song selections were either U2 (which I liked) or jarring Irish punk rock (which I don\'t), most of which were of the latter.  :(  Perhaps I should\'ve walked away after making these observations, but I\'ve had FM bookmarked for at least six years now, and I wanted to get it over with.\\n\\nAfter many inquiries about food preparation, the bread used (which company?  specific ingredients used?), etc., I decided I\'d go w/ the crabcakes and the braised rib sliders.  The crabcakes (topped w/ roasted red peppers and garnished w/ wasabi and mustard mayo, the latter I opted out) also came w/ a side mixed greens salad and a citrus vinaigrette. While this dish wasn\'t the best-looking of all the dishes I had that afternoon- don\'t let the pic of the bread pudding fool you, it was the best-tasting, but this isn\'t saying much.  I didn\'t care for the watered-down flavor of the citrus vinaigrette, and frankly, the crabcakes had enough flavor, so the lack of dressing wasn\'t a big deal.  I don\'t know if I\'d order them again, though...  What was a big let-down was the braised shortrib sliders\' dish.  Now these sliders looked fantastic, but the shortrib pieces were so sinewy and/or fatty, that, as much as I tried, I couldn\'t chew through any!  I really wanted to like these, bec. of those gorgeous-looking fried onion strings that sat on top of each slider.  Thankfully, my server offered to swap them for something else, and it was w/ a little sadness that I said goodbye to those onion strings :\'(\\n\\nLately, mussels haven\'t appealed to me, so my server\'s suggestion to try FM\'s wasn\'t giving me much hope.   Surprisingly, these mussels tasted OK, and the price is right (for happy hour), and if I weren\'t already not disappointed in the darkness of the pub; the loudness of the music\'s volume; and the sub-par quality of the shortribs, I may have enjoyed them more.  With the hope of finding something good to write about, I ordered the bread pudding.  (At this point, I should\'ve just given up.)\\n\\nThe bread pudding dish, which you\'d think, looking at the pics I took, would taste good,  was a disaster!  It was dark in the pub, yes, but the dish looked like they just placed slices of bread down, showered them w/ dried cranberries, and poured some white chocolate sauce.  Something was amiss- was it even baked?  How was it prepared?  There wasn\'t enough cream sauce to cover most of the bread.  I was told that the bread was indeed soaked in the cream, and then baked, but this bread pudding had to be the worst I\'ve ever tried.  The pics looked great, but don\'t be fooled...  \\n\\nThe server was friendly, and most of the stars reflect her attempts to appease me, but I didn\'t enjoy my experience there, and would never recommend this place to anyone."""""""\n'

aS"There were several things wrong with my recent visit to this restaurant.  I showed up wearing all black and was seated by a manager.  They use white linen and having worked in restaurants forever, I knew my napkin was going to leave white lint all over me.  I also knew that the manager knew, or should have.  I had to ask two people for a black napkin before one was delivered.  I ordered an Iced tea and the server brought me a mango Iced tea.  I asked her when she came back if they only had flavored tea and she said they did.  Why would you not tell me this when I ordered it you crazy beoch? Is what went through my head but I was celebrating my mother's birthday and didn't feel that would've been appropriate.  We ordered oysters and I ate two of them.  The first tasted like the ocean, not the nice clean blue waters of Hawaii type ocean, but the barnacle covered madness that smells like nasty ocean, you know what I mean.  The second one tasted better but I couldn't get the image of barnacles out of my head after that first one and I ate no more.  I then had the wedge salad which was fantastic and finished with Blacked Chicken Linguine in a cajun cream sauce.  It was also quite tasty.  Aside from the oysters the food was good, unfortunately the service calls for a two star rating.  Maybe this place is better during dinner.\n"

However, everything from\\n Service to food to drinks to pricing was a huge disappointment. Spending over $100 pp without drinks we expected to be wowed. Sadly we left hungry and irritated. Of all the nicer restaurants we dined In around Phoenix I.e. Mastros, sassi, roka, nobuo, ocean prime, etc.. This was by far the worst. Each Of the 7 portions came as a tiny bite leaving us underwhelmed and hungry. Food took Forever to come as did drinks. The servers were many but irritable and not very effective.. Overall of the 7 courses  not One left us satiated and pleasantly surprised. After a $300 meal we went out to eat and I was so annoyed I wanted to call the  owner and complain. Overrated, overpriced and completely Not worth it!!! Ps we do appreciate smaller, mOre meaningful entrees but a single scallop and a small forfull of fish should be considered a course when there is no main course.. The shrimp course consisted of 2 tiny shrimp In some pur\\u00e9e and he server had no clue where they came from Or if they were wild or farm raised. Embarrassing !!\n'

When our buzzer buzzed, I took it up and the gentleman at the front said it must have malfunctioned.  My BS meter went to 10 as we waited for another 10 minutes for a seat.  Once seated, the waitress took a ton of time to get our order, and then for some inexplicable reason didn't enter our order until the first kids meal came out to the table - spanning at least 45 minutes from sitting to serving.  Maybe it was a bad night, I could hear constant service and kitchen screw-ups from the party of 10 behind us.

BUT...there was a table in the bar so we opted for that instead.  We sat down and ordered and were very excited about the atmosphere.  We ordered the ravioli for an appetizer, OMG delicious!  Superb!  Amazing!!!  We then moved on to the Italian wedding soup- Yikes- something went wrong.  The orzo looked like rice and was in clumps on the bottom of the bowl.  It was so salty I could not even eat it.  I had to return it.  There didn't seem to be a problem with that and our waitress did take it off the bill.  Oh by the way, I had to ask 3 times for more butter for the lovely flat bread and sourdough they place on the table.  Also, my friend had to ask twice for hot water for her tea.  The service was slow, forgetful, and not so friendly.  So, let's get back to the food.   I had ordered a flatbread which was basically a totinos pizza. yuck!

In summary, the food was bland, the food was cold, the service wasn\'t that great, and the salsa and the guacamole were just plain WEIRD.  No need to overexplain bland and boring food (I had a chicken burrito, and I added cheese, rice, and sour cream), but I do want to point out that I ate GRISTLE in my chicken... which is what finally made me stop trying.  Other items to note:\\n\\n1.  The server would barely glance at us, and when she came to ask for our order, she hadn\'t even asked for a drink order first.  Also, we had to ask twice for more tortilla chips.  I will say, though, that our main dishes came out fast... but mine was ice cold.\\n\\n2.  The flavor of the salsa was okay, but the texture was-- as another Yelper has described-- exactly like ketchup.  Bizarre.\\n\\n3.  The guac.  Oh the guac.  Horrific.  The first question was the pale green color.  My friend and I spent at least 4 full minutes trying to figure out what one would mix with avocados to get that exact Lawrence Welk-era seafoam color.  There was no onion, no peppers, no lime, NO flavor.  After a few additional samplings (more out of morbid curiosity than anything), I came up with EGG.  Yes, like hard-boiled egg whites.  Color and texture.  Bweck.\\n\\nTo my food-loving compatriots out there:  don\'t do it.  Not worth your time or money."""""""\n'

No manager at the credit company would even believe us, and we've spent the last 5 months having them screw us over again and again charging these piddly late fees for what reason I have no clue, considering we paid it off in full once we found out they were a bunch of liars.

From the moment I stepped into this burger joint, I just couldn\'t feel the good vibe in the air. Three friends and I went here on our way to our grand road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles to Las Vegas and back. The consequences of not coming here were that (1) we could have eaten some steak at Big Texan Ranch at Amarillo, TX and/or (2) we could have visited the Grand Canyon. Let\'s just say at the end, we would have rather done the other options instead. Although we still saw the giant chasm on our way home, we still missed out on some potentially good steak in Amarillo.

From the segment, the place looked like a party. It was quite the opposite when my friends and I went. It seemed dead, although to HAG\'s defense, we came there on a Tuesday at 6:30, 2 hours before the restaurant closes. There were only two young nurses working as well as the head (older) nurse. The two young nurses were attractive but one of them was quite snobby. \\n\\nOK now to the burger. It was cooked real well and full of calories, lard, fat, and did I mention calories? I must say it was an \\""""okay\\"""" burger but not in the \\""""Got to have again!\\"""" category. With the unlimited fries that swam in lard, it\'s the same concept. I wasn\'t a big fan of getting my own condiments in the condiments bar. The same \\""""CNN Heart Attack Grill portion\\"""" clips was being played over and over on a loop throughout their big screens, rather than them showing sports. The aroma of a real hospital and the smell of lard also didn\'t help the cause. \\n\\nI had the Triple Bypass Burger and I was only able to eat it halfway. Overall, I can try to justify my 2-star rating because in my opinion, these burgers were not that great to me. My three other friends would definitely agree with me. Let me explain: Keep in mind that we were driving from Chicago to pass by Chandler non-stop. I don\'t know about my friends but I came through HAG\'s doors after being in a car for over 24 hours on a lightly filled stomach. Maybe it was the lard fries or the sugar Coke filling me up a little, but I didn\'t get the satisfaction from eating half of my burger. I actually got a better satisfaction from eating a Big Mac throughout the years. When it comes down to it, you eat here once and you\'ll probably not come back again, unless (1) you weigh over 350 lbs. and can eat for free, (2) You have paid the $500 annual membership fee to have 3 daily paid meals, or (3) you just want to check out the \\""""nurses.\\"""" \\n\\nI think my friends still have not forgiven me for taking them here.

Could not explain why he did not have an answer but he sure wanted to sell me a phone. That was the answer just buy a new phone we will give you a deal. I already had an iphone and I was unable to get the device turned on and it is because of some red tape no one had any paper work on that would produce a decision. every one said it was illegal to have possession of the phone but when I produced a police report I bought the phone they shut up. I also went to a different store where they printed off a duplicate recite and they were not happy because for every answer they had I had a point they were wrong.I also had them lookk in the records and see I purchased the iphone. He then began quoting me the law I said thats not whats in the report unless you have law enforcement degree you should not quote the law. I reminded him he could not even quote the liability clause he was so sure to stand by but could not prove he was right. I asked if while I was in the store could I call the customer service line they said yeah. He cut me off from the call. I have no idea why. the manager had to come over an reconnect the call. I told Erich I felt like i was in a circle jerk and he said first of all that language is not allowed. I said what language. He said I do not like your language I am offended. I looked right at him and said is it Erich (wanting to make sure I pronounced his name correct) What are your referring to when you say language. Because I call customer service they tell me to come here I come here you tell me to call customer service to me that is a circle jerk. he said I was offending him I said this whole situation is offensive to me!  Your lack of customer service is offensive. I paid good money for a phone i cannot turn on because of a legality which is really just an ethical decision that no one wants to make because there is no clarification on the liability clause you have just surfaced. I realize that is a new thing for this company but it is well defined your employees both front and back office as they were termed to me would not and could not produce any paper work substantiating the fact I could not get a new number linked to my device. But they were all too happy to allow me to purchase a new phone. Is this how Verizon does business this seems like a close fine line to extortion to me.\\nAre managers or store owners  like Erich the new faces of sell sell sell. Why was someone allowed to procure a line from my plan when they were not financially sound to do so. Isn\'t that how the housing market got in this fix. Now that the person ha had a change in heart and will no longer make payments on his line and hasn\'t for some time I am locked out of a device. i offered to take back over the line and resume liability of the line in question. I just wanted to use my phone. I was told over the phone by customer service on more than one occasion that it is a simple switch of the number he continues to pay on the number and a new number is put on my device. this old number is put on \\blank device\\"""".  Or in Mr. Motts case the number is not being paid on and you guys can deal with that. \\nHe was a former Verizon wireless service manager and manipulated the system. I realize he is not employed there any more and I realize you may never employ him again but why must i suffer in the after math. is that the plan sell phones to people and not allow them to use them. There was no clause saying I resend my permission. I did it with in the allowed 60 days as I was quoted on the phone. This should of been a easy reversal. once I said that, Erich said it was 30 days once I said fine the original request to resend was now 7 days ago I have been doing this all week well with in the 30 days allowed and not all the notes have made it in the system. Erich then told me 14 days. Really!???!

Since I notice most reviews of this place are very positive and extremely long I'll try to be direct and to the point. \\nService was incredibly slow. We waited a long time for food and to pay our bill. I noticed everyone waiting a long time for their food and when stuff came out it was in odd bursts. \\nAtmosphere was some what pretentious and for the food I ate not at all warranted.\\nFood was uninteresting and mediocre. I ordered the grass fed burger medium rare on a gluten free bun. The burger was preformed and nowhere near medium rare.  They way this place markets itself I was expecting something fresh and well prepared. Instead I got something I'm pretty sure had been frozen in the shape in which it was cooked and brought to me. I wouldn't be surprised if the whole meal was cooked in a microwave. The bun was gluten free bread which is okay someplace that doesn't use the word bun on their menu. My friend's pizza we also compared to frozen pizza cooked in a microwave.\\n\\nI love food and have eaten at amazing gluten free and other health conscious restaurants  in many cities so I think I can be a good judge.

It\'s definitely an event, but apart from security, port-a-pottys, \\""""beer gardens,\\"""" and wrist bands - it\'s just some boring food and drink. \\n\\nMy biggest problem with it is that you have to pay to get in, then you have to buy tickets so you can buy food and drink. They should just raise the price of admission, and have the food be free plus a drink ticket or two. I mean, this should be about restaurants showing off what they can do to get people interested in eating there. \\n\\nThe vendors at these booths all paid to be here. People pay to get in, and I\'m sure the promoter makes a portion of the overall ticket sales. Whoever runs this thing is probably making bank off it. It\'s a huge sham when you think about it. Red Bull paid a ton to be there and have a premium spot - they weren\'t even giving their drinks away (which they often do at events like this).\\n\\nOverall, it was a big joke - but we managed to have fun.

aS'"""As someone who has had working experience in the airline industry on the scheduling and pricing end, I feel I can\'t gripe about the usual boohoos everyone else has about the airline industry. To clear up a few things to express my point: \\n\\n-Long lines: this is a part of going to the airport. Get over it or deal with the several-times-longer method of surface transit\\n-Delays: this is another part of the airport experience. So what if it\'s sunny and gorgeous outside. Your flight began in Atlanta, where there are thunderstorms and tornadoes. \\n-Cranky people: air travel may not be as easy as you think. In the year 2009, the questions people still ask surprise me. *Fun Fact: Did you know an E-ticket is exactly that? An ELECTRONIC ticket. Yeah, you can book travel and go to the airport with nothing but your government-issued ID and you\'ll get a boarding pass. You REALLY don\'t need anything else. Little kinks in the grand system and little things happening in people\'s lives can make them a bit cranky\\n-Uncomfortable seats: airplanes are metal tubes run by people who want to cram as many people in as possible in order to make a profit. This is a capitalist society and that\'s just part of it. Lower-quality seats are cheaper to purchase than plush velvet.\\n\\nThat and more make up the curse of air travel. Now, I will focus specifically on Southwest. They are a \\closet hub-and-spoke\\"""" airline, as in they consider themselves point-to-point. I will admit that they do offer a fair selection of some point-to-point routes. However like all airlines they have hubs and focus cities, Phoenix being one of their hubs. This means that it is likely that if you live here, or visit here frequently, you will use it for a domestic flight. They are decent for Vegas or Southern California cities, but aren\'t a great option for many large cities east of Arizona, especially those with two or more commercial airports, as they typically service the most inconvenient ones for vacations, such as BWI, Dallas Love, Chicago Midway or MacArthur Islip on Long Island. \\n\\nTheir flight attendants remind me of preschool teachers and it seems they get end-of-the-year bonuses for acting like clowns. They\'re nice and friendly, but a bit overly perky and bubbly. The unassigned seating is a fiasco and this airline more than any other American carrier seems to be the de facto family carrier. I haven\'t been on any other carrier that attracts as many children, and I\'ve been on a long list from American to Continental, from Cathay Pacific to Thai, from Asiana to AirFrance. Southwest  does offer competitive rates, but you will get what you pay for, including a flying day care and mystery seat. The whole A,B,C boarding process is ridiculous, as you really have no say in where you sit. For a weekend trip to Vegas or Southern California, from Phoenix, your options are US Airways, Southwest or United Express (LAX only) and in my opinion, unless Southwest offered an unbeatable deal, I would pay a little more to take either of the other two.\\n\\nI could prattle on about specific experiences, though those could happen on any airline. In short, the structure and policies of Southwest are its weakest points. I will say that it isn\'t the worst airline I\'ve ever been on (Aeroflot is the absolute worst and most likely will always be the absolute worst) but I would definitely look at other options, even choosing a layover on a different carrier though Southwest might offer a non-stop option. As I said before, I would fly it again, but only if the difference in fare between it and its competition was significantly lower."""""""\n'

Now I do think that the previous reviewers rating of one star was a bit extreme, because it's not that bad, but it's not good either. Something about the place is just off. The food court setting isn't bad really, it's just the way things were done. First off, they asked if I wanted iced tea or something else when I had already asked for tea, just the regular tea that every dim sum place across the country gives you usually without even asking. The tea itself was a bit off too. As for the carts it was just the same three carts for the duration of our thirty minute stay. I got the baked char siu bun and the siu mai. Everything looked pretty unappetizing except for the pastries and these noodles the ladies at the table behind us had. The bun I had was alright, but the pork filling was totally sub-par. The siu mai was not very good either. Also, the chile oil on the table had an off consistency too. Like I said before I really wanted to like this place but I just can't.

aS'Three of us went to Fresh Mint today for lunch.  We did not like it.  We started with an order of Summer Rolls.  Yuck, they were a piece of tofu and shredded cabbage rolled in rice paper, served with a thick, unappealing peanut sauce studded with raw peanuts. Presentation was nice, but it did not taste like anything except cabbage wrapped in rice paper.  My companions each ordered Pad Thai and I had the Five Spice Pho.  The Pad Thai arrived first. I looked at it and was very happy I did not order it.  It looked like a plate of gummy sauce-covered glop.  Tasted as bad as it looked. My Five Spice Pho looked delicious, but did not have any flavor.  Adding the hot sauce that is served on the side, only added heat, but no flavor.  The broth tasted like water.  We did like the Mint Lemonade, but at $3.95 a glass, it was pretty pricey.  Our lunch bill came to $44.  Very expensive for what we were served.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I am crossing Fresh Mint off my list.  No reason to go back.  I gave it 2 stars out of respect for the Yelpers that think it is so great, but actually, I would rather give it one.  Vegetarian does not have to be bland and tasteless.\n'

aS"This place has great decor and some smokin servers from time to time, but the food and prices have been a disappointment on every occasion.\\n\\nI can't tell you how many times I have given this place a chance over the past 4 or more years. On some occasions we were there for a birthday, and on other occasions just to grab a quick bite.\\n\\nThe dishes which contain chicken breast have always been overcooked and very dry. As for the Sushi rolls, they are far from the best, and certainly nothing special. On occasion they have a rendition of ceviche or a squid salad which both sound promising. Once again on each occasion, the presentation was there, but the portions were very small, certainly didn't taste like anything that was satisfying, and the price tag was insulting for what we had.\\n\\nThe only reason that I go to this place at all now, is to grab a quick drink if I'm walking around the area.\\n\\nThis is one of those places that creates the stereotypical Scottsdale image, just as RA does just up the street. It's a place to say that you ate at if you want to be a stereotypical, brain dead, Scottsdale doucher. The fact that you consider it to be the best means one of the following:\\n\\n1.) You were extremely fortunate and your food was prepared and presented to perfection.\\n\\n2.) You have no idea what good sushi consists of, and are probably a huge fan of California, Las Vegas, or Godzilla rolls.\\n\\nor\\n\\n3.) You are a young blonde bombshell with no brain who thinks that it's cool to eat Sushi because you are a sheep and think that everything that you see on 'Keeping up with the Kardashian's' is what real life is all about. (or because you watch some other BS show on MTV and are influenced by the complete ass hats with no brains).\\n\\nEither way, this place is typically a terrible place to go and eat if you want to enjoy good Sushi, Sashimi, etc.\\n\\nThey do have a nicely decorated interior and sit at a nice location in old town.\\n\\nIf you're dating a younger girl with her head in the clouds she will love this place! =)\\n\\nSorry for the rant and ill painted picture, you can see that I'm over the Scottsdale illusion and have no tolerance for it...\\n\\nIf you are in the area, I would hit Kyoto or Pearl before this place, but a quick drive to Missouri and 7th ave will get you the best Sushi experience with a decent price tag.\\n\\nCheers and much luv! =)\\n\\nFYI...I'm certainly not hating on blonde females, I love them to death as long as they don't fit into that superficial stereotype.\n"

aS"Aunt Chilada's at the Pointe is more about atmosphere than food.  It has a good happy hour, but the food is pretty pedestrian.  I was forced to edit and downgrade my rating because of my most recent visit.  Though the service was quite good, the food was horrific. \\n\\nWas there again recently with some folks from work. It was chosen since it was close to the hotel our corporate visitors were staying. I decided to forgo the usual safe burro and try the chile relleno and the spinach enchilada. O...M...G...what a mistake.  The spinach enchilada consisted of a limp tortilla filled with frozen spinach and covered in a sauce that if it wasn't from a can was seasoned with tin...ha...ha. The relleno was stuffed with queso, breaded, deepfried, covered with the same tin flavored sauce, which in turn was then covered again with rubbery white cheese. Oh boy!  What a treat!  After this meal I have made a vow to never to stray from a burro here again. \\n\\nSo, if you plan on getting together with a big group for Happy Hour, Aunt Chilada's is an OK choice.  If you are looking for truly top flight Mexican food, there are other places that may be more appropriate.\n"

Decor is Flintstones meets Happy Days on the Oregon Trail. Or something.  Which would be fun....if the food was edible.

aS"The first thing I noticed was its nice patio area.  The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.\\n\\nMy wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.\\n\\nI was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.\\n\\nWhile we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.\\n\\nMy cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.\\n\\nThe cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.\\n\\nThe saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.\\n\\nTheir dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?  Where's the allure?\\n\\nSorry Liberty Market.  Our first trip was very disappointing, which means it will probably be our last.\n"

It was when I drove down the street that I noticed the car hadn't even been washed!

In general, they don't embue trust to me and don't really seem to know what they're doing. \\n\\nThe manager explained that I needed to sign the waiver PRIOR to them washing my car.

Ah, because it\'s been consistently below average.\\n\\nFirst off, the hotel is open-air and the rooms open to nature, as opposed to an interior corridor.  During the winter, it\'s not too bad, but when I go during the summer, it sucks - especially right after checking in and having to trek across the sprawling property (nicely manicured, though it may be) in 120 degree weather.  \\n\\nI also hate the wifi service.  I tend to scoff when a hotel says they have \\high speed\\"""" Internet because it\'s usually akin to dial up.  Granted, it\'s speedier than the 14.4kbs (yes, I\'m dating myself), but it doesn\'t feel a whole lot better.  I\'m exaggerating, but if you\'ve ever watched Yelp load over a slow connection, you know my frustration.\\n\\nAnother issue I have had is the pool.  Well, not the pool in and of itself.  It\'s the bands that play until midnight or later.  Priceline must hate me, because I\'m always stuck with a room by the pool, and always on a night they have a band.  Wouldn\'t be so bad, except for the fact I\'m always there for business and usually have to wake up at 5am the next day.  \\n\\nNow, I will give this place credit for being a nice plate to rest your head (when the music dies down) and, if you use Priceline, you can end up with a great rate.

aS"Montelucia Resort in Scottsdale, AZ recommended ExecuCar to take my family and I from Phoenix Airport to the resort. I booked a week in advance as I was flying my mother and sisters in from PA and I was flying in from CA. The morning of travel I received a call from ExecuCar as I was on my way to the airport that they would not be able to fit our bags (which I indicated the total when I made the reservations) and my options were to cancel or pay double and they would accommodate us. I cancelled and booked a midsize car which cost me over $400 for the days wer were at the resort. I was stuck as I was already in route to the airport and booked 8 min before boarding my flight. I can not believe they waited to contact me about this on my way to the airport when i booked days before. I called the resort and said they need to stop recommending this service. When I get to the airport they were there to pick me up because the resort was ready to pay the double fee for me, however at this point I had already pre-paid $400+ for the rental car. This service (ExecuCar) is horrible and did not even ask the size of our bags. We were able to get all of us and our bags into a mid size car. I am a Director of Sales and was excited to use them in the future and was treated so badly and put in a terrible situation by them and under a lot of stress on a holiday weekend.\\n\\nUse any other service than ExecuCar.

Thinking he was just being difficult, I said he had to eat it.  I watched him gag through another bite and realized something was wrong.  My husband then looked at it and smelled it and the ham was BAD.  I mean really BAD like off color and smelled rotten.  I was in shock.  That could make someone really sick.  We told the waiter who was not surprised at all.  Just offered to take it back and take it off the bill and replace it??   I was shocked and really worried about my son getting sick.  The manager was not concerned and acted like I was overreacting.  \\nMy family has never gone back but I was talking with my neighbor the other day and he said the same thing happen to him.

Waiter was attentive and immediately brought us menus and took our drink order. I ordered the Shrimp Po\'Boy and my b/f ordered the Gyro. As we were waiting on our food I glanced/looked around the restaurant. Taking it all in. Poorly decorated. Could use a deep cleaning. The condiment bottles greasy/sticky with fingerprints. Most of the ketchup bottles on the tables were empty. Also had me wondering if they keep the squeeze ketchup bottles refrigerated at night since they were all dirty and empty. Our food came. Our plates looked appetizing. French fries were soggy and cold. Not crispy whatsoever. The shrimp on my Po\'Boy were big. The cornmeal coating on the shrimp was tasty. The hoagie bun was dried out completely. It fell apart or you could say crumbled apart. I ended up just eating the shrimp and leaving the bread  and  fries. Very disappointed. My b/f said his gyro was \\just okay\\"""". It had pieces of chicken, turkey bacon,  and  beef in it. Not your traditional gyro. His fries, too, were soggy and cold.

We sat there for another 10 minutes before our order was taken.

At that point, the server asked if we wanted desert and mumbled something about padding his tip before dropping the bill off. \\n\\nThis was my first experience at this restaurant and I have to say that it didn't live up to the expectations.

I don't know if you can ask for grilled.  They don't ask.  I don't eat beef so that kind of limits me.  the beef could be awesome and chicken great.  Better than taco bell, but i would have to go back and try it again for a solid grade.  but if you are hungry and you will eat anything they seem to have a lot of specials.\n"

aS'"""Looking for a romantic dining experience with below average food?  Here it is.\\n\\nWe were excited to try this place because we\'d heard about the patio seating overlooking a lake, romantic lighting, and even an outdoor fire pit.  \\n\\nBut as we were being seated, we noticed the restaurant was almost empty.  Not a good sign.  It took a while for a server to approach our table.  When we asked to see the prix fixe menu, he seemed annoyed.   We decided against ordering from the prix fixe menu anyway, because it was solely Irish food designed to commemorate St. Patrick\'s Day, even though we were there a week or so after the holiday.  It took another long while to actually place our food order.   I also asked for an ice tea refill, which never came.  This is not the kind of service you\'d expect for a \\fine dining\\"""" experience.\\n\\nAs for the food, after our salad course, we were presented with a complimentary amuse bouche which was a little bit of olive oil, cheese, and a cherry tomato, served stylishly in a shot glass (see pic).  This seemed like a promising way to start our meal.  My husband had the filet and he said it was good.  I had the pork chop and it was awful.  Most of it was grizzled fat, and when I could find a pocket of lean meat, it was dry and flavorless.  I\'m usually not one to complain, but the meat was so tough, I had difficulty cutting it, even with a big steak knife.  I should have returned it, but I didn\'t want to make a scene in such a beautiful environment.  I regret that decision.\\n\\nYes, the patio setting is lovely, but given the poor service and sub-standard food, we won\'t be returning"""""""\n'

A group of workers, including who we found out was the manager later, was sitting at the bar chattin it up. I had to pardon myself to be rude enough to interrupt their convo about justin bieber to please wipe down a table for us. Poor guy stands up slowly and wipes it down until its... uhhh... smeared with the ketchup from the prior visitor. thanks. so im already swallowing my complaints because my kids love those flippen hats. Thats when I see Mr. Cook with his gloves on by the rest of the group of workers eating his friends fries, then goes over to cook some poor customers food with those same gloves. Done.

aS'"""First, I\'ll start by saying that the food, once I was served, was good. Nowhere near worth the price. Certainly not worth the wait.\\n\\nThe only reason I came by here was that they have a sign proclaiming that they are mostly gluten-free. I walked in, the place is empty, and I waited quite a while before anyone bothered to come out and seat me, without a menu. Eventually the waitress brought me out pita bread with onions. I asked her if the pita bread was gluten-free and she told me of course it wasn\'t.\\n\\nNow, I figured this, however, if your restaurant is proud to be gluten free, and hangs a sign outside to encourage customers seeking gluten-free foods then a) you should ask first before you bring out (not counting desserts) the main item of food that ISN\'T gluten-free out to your customer and b) don\'t be rude to your customer. Look, you just basically waved something delicious that I miss in front of me and in effect said \\too bad you can\'t have this.\\""""\\n\\nGetting past that, I was finally given a menu, and PLENTY of time to decide what I wanted. I ordered the Chicken Filet Sultani, which is chicken kabob with a ground meat koobideh kabob.\\n\\nThe koobideh was good, the chicken was kind of tough. Not dry, but maybe overdone. \\n\\nI then also had to wait for the waitress to come around for me to pay the bill. I just dropped cash and left.\\n\\nIf you are craving Persian food and you are in North Scottsdale, do not go to Pars.

aS"I wanted to like Bison Witches.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, the best thing Bison Witches has going for it is its clever name. \\n\\nLet's start with the high points.  The sandwiches are large--the half sandwich is easily what you'd make for yourself at home and would call a sandwich.  The menu has a pretty large selection of sandwiches, and there are some other options, like soup and some appetizers.  There's a fair bit of outdoor seating to enjoy the gorgeous spring weather.  And, if you like beer, they've got a pretty good selection, even sporting a Hoegaarden on tap (a personal favorite).  They have some pretty decent happy hour specials... as such, if you're looking to waste away an afternoon hanging out with your friends, chatting over a few beers, and enjoying the day, you could do worse (especially being near Mill Ave.)\\n\\nThe place is really more bar than sandwich shop--the inside is a rectangular space lined with booths, with a a square bar in the middle surrounded by free-standing tables.  A couple of TVs strewn around the bar is a nod to a sports-bar environment, though I wouldn't ever visit with the real intention of watching a game.  As for the booth we sat in, it was broken, and I spent a fair bit of my time moving the seat back in place and wondering if it would tip it over.   \\n\\nAs renowned as the sandwiches are, I was disappointed to find them to be all bread.  The bread is fairly enjoyable, actually, as it's fresh and the slices are sizable and toasted.  But when they pair it with the rest of the sandwich, it's really not much to write home about.  I didn't feel any desire to try another sandwich after sampling the beef  and  brie on wheat--a little too sweet, too much bread.  My friend was none-to-impressed with her club, an easy sandwich that should please all comers.  The service was mediocre at best, perhaps bordering on curt a couple times, but I did appreciate their leaving us to be and drink for some time after we finished eating.\\n  \\nYou could do worse with your time and money, but you could certainly do better.  I wouldn't make plans to go to Bison Witches again, but I might go there again if pressed.  Certainly I'd be happy to sit there and throw back a couple Hoegaardens with friends and not worry about all the stuff I should really be doing...\n"

The last time was a week or so ago. Ordered a chicken dish which I don't see on the online menu. It was three stuffed chicken breasts and was a bit over $20 with no sides. Then we ordered pasta with marinara for an additional $9 or so and garlic bread for another $8ish. For the amount of food you get, the prices are a bit high. The chicken was really good, the pasta and garlic bread were very so-so. Not much different than I would expect at an Olive Garden or the like. Service was excellent and our waitress was very nice and helpful.\n"

aS'How disappointing my last visit here, and it was entirely attributed to the staff. These two girls (new since my last visit there) work there who have no concept of waiting on people, let alone running a business. They seemed more interested in chatting with their friends hanging out there then servicing customers. I sat there for ten minutes and neither of them bothered to even acknowledge me. What a shame that the good food and drink and nice ambience of the place has been ruined by an incompetent staff. It was like the place has been taken over by high schoolers. Too many other wine bars are out there that provide consistent customer service for me to bother returning to this place ever again.\n'

aS'We had been hearing rave reviews about this pizza and yelp has the reviews to back up what we were hearing.  The staff is super friendly.  One of the best things about this pizza place is that when there is a line to be seated you can pre order your pie so when you sit down you wait for food is very short.  It is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out.\\n\\nOn to the food.  Started with the 1/2 and 1/2 dinner salad.  The Italian dressing was just ok for me, but there was nothing wrong with it.  The 1/2 of spinach was non existent.  The pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed.  My biggest complaint about the pie was the sweet sauce.  So sweet in fact that I had to add salt to try to cut the sweetness.  Defiantly not my favorite pie.\n'

aS"Delux serves an OK  burger. For the price you pay, I've had much better. Just go to In N Out for your burger fix. It's better and cheaper. I'm not sure where people say this burger is phenomenal. Anything usually tastes good with a lot of butter/oil and bacon, which are one of two main ingredients of the Delux Burger after the beef. \\n\\nBut, other than that, the food here is marginal. The Chinese Chicken Salad was horrible (chicken wasn't cooked), fish sandwich was bland, and the grilled chicken sandwich was less tasty than McDonald's McGrilled Chicken.  \\n\\nThey have a decent selection of beers; however, the waitresses were slow with drinks and water. I would go to Four Peaks any day as the food is better and the drinks are cheaper. For burgers, save your money and go to In N Out.

To the chefs credit they are trying to leverage local by buying at the public market, but poor preparation and presentation, can\'t be overcome by \\Local\\"""" sourcing.\\n\\nThe other issue is that many nights the bartender is forced to run for food, leaving the bar unattended for long periods of time - a turn off to customers wanting service and for those just arriving, a signal to change their mind and leave.\\n\\nAlso, they should think about hiring some staff that can be found there every night like clock work - get some with personalities (anyone can make a drink, not anyone can host a hotel lobby bar).

aS'"""I find LGO to be a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde type of place, so I will give a review with equal parts duality. In the end though, I\'m going to go against the overwhelming positive grain and give it two stars for reasons below. \\n\\nThe Food\\n\\nMr. Hyde Says - This place seems to be two different types of restaurants. There\'s the breakfast/brunch servings and then there\'s the alternate menu, which consists of salads and their eponymous pizzas. For what it\'s worth, I\'ve been here many times, more than I cared to, but my girlfriend used to live within walking distance, so it was too convenient to counter with any convincing argument against going. Of the many visits for breakfast, I\'ve just felt underwhelmed by the food. The egg dishes, crepes, etc always leave me feeling unsatisfied and find they lack a bit of punch in the flavor department. For what it\'s worth, they\'re going for a French flare to the cuisine, but it still always seems to under deliver. \\n\\nDr. Jekyll Says - On the contrary, the non-breakfast foods are quite good. The salads and the pizzas are really good, freshly made and what you would expect from an \\artisanal\\"""" pizza place. Additionally, they have a solid beer and wine list. \\n\\nThe Brick And Mortar\\n\\nMr. Hyde Says - This place, specifically during the breakfast hours, is a disaster and would make any Retail Operations manager cringe at the lack of flow before them. You line up at one station to order food and pay. You line up at another station to order coffee and pay. There\'s no table service. You have to order your food, all the while, scout for the random table opening, while also keeping a watchful eye out for your food to make sure you claim it before it goes cold. And, to top it off, this entire place also operates as what most people think is a really cute market, full of curios that other people call junk. Mr. Hyde believes that this market only adds to the utter chaos and lack of flow for the restaurant. It would be different if it was off to the side, but smack in the middle of everything yields chaos. \\n\\nDr. Jekyll Says - Avoid breakfast and go for dinner, where you can have great salads, pizzas and actually be seated at a table by a hostess and served by a waiter. What a revelation. The dinner area is actually in a different room and you can avoid the really cute market.\\n\\nThe Getting There\\n\\nMr. Hyde Says - The parking, or rather lack there of, is a huge negative. There is minimal parking on premises, minimal parking across the street, with most of the neighboring businesses posting signs, threatening to tow you. \\n\\nDr. Jekyll Says - Let\'s call this place what it is - a nice neighborhood restaurant that can prove \\""""convenient\\"""" if you live nearby and can walk, avoiding the hassle and frustration that awaits you when you have to drive there. \\n\\nSummary\\nIn the end, it\'s really four stars for the pizza, two for the breakfast foods, but they get dinged an extra star for the headache that is parking. \\n\\nMany Phoenicians love this place. I (we) think you can do better elsewhere. \\n\\nAuthor\'s Note: My girlfriend has now moved from this neighborhood, so any argument in her favor for a visit based on proximity is now moot. Mr. Hyde has cracked a menacing smile."""""""\n'

aS"First: This is the tallest restaurant I've ever been to.\\n\\nSecond: They give pretty generous servings of beer in ironically tall glasses. Their wines are pretty good too.\\n\\nThird: Mr. Biersch's brewery and eatery, when it comes down to it, is really just a fancy version of BJ's minus the flatscreens projecting the latest sports event. The food isn't that great. Most American food restaurants fit within the nexus of the TGIFriday's scale: a fancy version of TGIFriday's being the best, Normal TGIFriday's being just TGIFriday's, and Poor Man's TGIFriday's being something like Denny's. This spot falls into the fancier version of TGIFriday's. You get the picture. I ordered a veggie pizza which literally was a thin-crust pizza that someone dumped a bowl of spinach on top after it came out of the oven. It's how a jock understands vegetarian eating.\\n\\nFourth: The staff is really friendly, but ultimately really busy because they're understaffed. It's probably related to our nation's clusterfuck to the poor house, but I think it's a restaurant's job to make sure that the customers are seen to.\\n\\nFifth: Their food is overpriced for what it is.\\n\\nSixth: This place isn't that bad, it just has no soul. It is what it is. You go for a burger, you go to drink, or you go to watch a game. Maybe a combination of all three.\\n\\nSeventh: If you're a diehard about this place, at some point in your dining life your idea of class was probably something along the lines of drinking champagne in Hooters.\n"

Now, I should start by saying I used to live right by this Meineke and in the past they have always done a great job at a fair price. Yesterday however, they told me that my battery was bad, and I needed to take it back to wherever it had been installed as it was still under warranty. I had had it installed THERE, a few years earlier, but for some reason they had no record of it. I was told that without proof of this, it would be over $230 for a new battery installation. I don't know a lot about cars but I DO know that is insanely high for a new battery for my 2002 Toyota. I took it over to Fletcher Tires and they got me a new battery in 15 minutes for $90 and they were absolutely as nice as could be.

Ugh - I won't even go there.  The health dept really needs to pay this place a visit!\n"

aS"I like the products offered at Sports Chalet and have shopped here since they opened this location a couple of years ago. The service on the other hand leaves much to be desired. I know there is a recession and retailers are still operating at times with short staffs, but maybe if you had some workers, you would sell a product or two. I stopped by Sports Chalet today at lunch and made 8 to 9 laps around the store looking for a couple of products. No workers approached me to ask if I needed help or wanted to see anything - in fact no workers in site except for the two ladies at the front counter. A couple of loops through the shoe department and I found what could have been what I was looking for, but on further inspection, it wasn't. Finally someone approached and asked if I was finding everything or had questions. I was looking for the pouch that can hold the Nike Plus chip on a shoelace for non-Nike shoes. What I had in my hand was a mini wallet that would hold your key and maybe an ID. I asked the worker if that was the product I was looking for - clearly not knowing what he was selling he said yes, that's what I needed. I never did find the other things I was looking for or the correct product. I put it down and found what I needed at RoadRunner.\\n\\nSports Chalet isn't bad if you know what you are looking for and can find it yourself - but don't expect help from the sales staff. Any knowledgeable help anyway.\n"

The equipment, furniture and menus all looked pretty new; and the staff, while very friendly, seemed a little slow in their processes.

I\'m not sure what my experience would have been had I stayed, but what I took with me was very disappointing (and I only traveled about two blocks by car before I opened the bag). \\n\\nI had ordered the combo of a Chicago dog, soda and natural fries. I noticed as my dog was being assembled that they sprayed the top of the bun with a little water mist to allow the poppy seeds to stick and I had a sinking feeling right there. The baskets of crinkle-cut fries that were coming out of the kitchen looked good, so I thought at least I had that to look forward to.\\n\\nHowever, as I suspected, a bun that is sprayed with water and then immediately wrapped in foil is not a happy camper and neither was I. In their menu they mention how the \\""""natural casing\\"""" (otherwise known as intestine) will snap when bitten into (implying quality, I guess), but mine was chewy. And my natural-cut fries were less than half the portion I saw everyone else getting, undercooked and soggy (from what I could see, they didn\'t use the classic technique to make fresh-cut fries crispy). Unfortunately, the best part of my meal was the Dr. Pepper.\\n\\nAnd to top it off, my meal cost $9, including a small tip. WAY too much for what I got.\\n\\nSo, friendly (and apologetic) people, not-so-good food. I might try it again, but I would give them six months or more to get their act together."""""""\n'

I liked the fact that they had a pretty good assortment of bikes outside as well as inside, and I had a chance to look around before I was greeted and asked if I needed help. I told the guy that I was sort of new to biking in the Valley, would be going down x road, and that I had (here\'s where it goes VERY south) 500$ to spend. At that point, he shook his head and told me that I should go to Tempe where they have a school program where they build bikes from recycled parts and that that would be in my price range. \\nREALLY. \\nHow condescending of you. There were bikes that were in the price range (I saw before he greeted me), he didn\'t even give any explanation such as, \\Oh, a decent bike is $$$, let me show you why.\\"""" Just acted like I am not good enough to be there, or apparently get a new bike and should buy a recycled one.

I mean to have to scrape refried beans from the bottom of a box... not cool! It really lacked presentation. However their yogurt with fruit was great as was the fruit con creama.

aS'"""At first look, this may seem like a hotel that you may compare with the Standard Hotels in Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles judging by their photos.  They even promote the fact that they won a four star review from Howard Seftel (who is a restaurant critic) for \\Best of Phoenix\\"""". Since I was going on this trip for work I didn\'t mind checking it out.  I mean why not sacrifice the points to stay at something on the up and up?  WRONG IDEA.\\n\\nFirst let me say that I should have researched this further but I was going off their site and some user reviews.  When I arrived to the hotel, it wasn\'t very noticeable.  It wasn\'t noticeable because it was on a quick one way street or hidden behind other structures, but rather more for the fact that it was in the middle of a neighborhood surrounded by apartment complexes.  The exterior of the business didn\'t look very impressive.  It looked like a poor girl who was trying too hard to be noticed by wearing trendy clothes that don\'t look right on her.  This motel make-over covered its old self as well as the best concealer on an acne ridden 13 year old.\\n\\nThere was music playing through out the hotel, and I did take notice of their strong consistency of marketing to a select demographic (ie. young, urban, chic 20-early 30s).  When I stepped into my room I was glad to see that the pictures spoke the truth on what to expect.  Everything in the room was new --- from furniture to carpet.  They had a wonderful bed, one of the most comfortable that I\'ve slept on during my business travels.  The only thing that I have to complain about the room is:\\n\\n1. The air conditioner didn\'t work or I didn\'t know how to work it\\n2. They have no pens in the hotel room, yet they have notepads\\n3. The WiFi didn\'t work that great because the signal was too weak and they didn\'t have a hard wire LAN line\\n\\nAs for  the restaurant that was located within the hotel, I didn\'t give it any chance.  There were only 2 people dining in there (even after I went out for an hour drive, the same people were there!) and it seemed so dead.  If I wanted to eat alone I would have eaten fast food or ordered a pizza.  I checked out their \\""""24 hour fitness\\"""" area and noticed that most of the cardio equipment was out of order (why even advertise it then?!?!?!).  There was nothing to do within walking distance of the hotel, unless you wanted to stand by a corner and wait to score a dime sack or get a soda at the gas station.\\n\\nOverall, I can see the message that this hotel is trying to send but I think that they are in the wrong location.  They have a long way to go but I see a really, really long road ahead of them.\\n\\nFor their location (because location is everything), I must give them 2 stars.\\n\\nWill NOT see you there.\\n\\nSam"""""""\n'

aS'I have friends that rave obout this place so I decided to try it. I think I made a mistake on ordering a salad from the VSC. Dont get me wrong, it was very fresh and tasted good. It was just a whole lotta lettuce and not so much toppings. I ordered the Cobb and there was maybe the equilivant of 2 pieces of meat, not sure if the bacon bits were fresh or packaged, about 1/4 of an avacado, and a tablespoon of blue cheese crumbles. The homemade crouton were good and the salad dressing was excellant. \\n\\nNow for a salad that cost over $7.00, that is just no right. Less lettuce and more protien would have been perfect. \\n\\nBut they were very friendly and the salad tasted good. Next time I will go with a sammich.\n'

I have the opportunity to sample the chicken wings, mac and cheese, collards and yams. It was just ok. The mac and cheese was bland, the yams were decent. The fried chicken is hit or miss. Once my chicken was finger looking good; but then it tasted reheated.  The place is always packed with a diverse customer base; which is great.

We weren't able to get a reservation until 8:30 which was ok, but then we weren't seated until close to 9:00. They were offering a special, $30 for 3 courses. The first course, the cheese was really good. Then came our entree course. Our burner was going out which wasn't an issue during the cheese. But our meats and vegetables were taking close to 10 minutes to cook, when it should take 2-3. Our waitress was aware that it was taking longer and suggested that we move, but if anyone has been there, you know it's not that simple. The dessert was next and honestly it's the only reason I would go back. Based on my first full meal experience, I will not be returning to a Melting Pot.\n"

This place used to be one my auntie's favorites, so I chose to give it a go... We entered a booth filled resturant that seemed frozen in the 80s or worse - the early 90s.

It was just meh. Taco Bell does a better jobat this lunch time favorite than these guys do. My mom got the cheese omlet special.

We left disappointed though, the food was par at best and the service was slightly below par.  We had an eclectic dinner for my mom's birthday, I had the Margareta pizza which was alright, but I've certainly had better.  My mom had the macadamia nut mahi mahi and it was alright, the grilled veggies were so soaked in better or oil that they were almost uneatable.  I'm of the belief that if you have quality produce you don't need to soak them in butter after grilling and before serving.  My husband had the whiskey apple glazed chicken which was actually the best of our dinners but not over the top delicious just alright.  Skinny ritas are not to be missed, hands down the best part of our meal, skip the lemon drop though.  Also just a note for the bartender, I had the first cosmo I'd had in a while (just sounded yummy) and it was full of tiny pieces of lime, like lime pulp it was terrible.  At $9 I shouldn't have to strain my own cocktail.  We also order a piece of the huge chocolate cake for dessert (to take home) after a few hours we split it up, it's all sugar and no chocolate it seems.

Today I called to ask what the lunch special was, and was informed that it was sushi, wonton harmony, and blissful friend rice.  Great, thats what a lunch special usualy includes...small orders of a few different items.  Nope, when i called back to order this special, i was told I was to choose one of the 3, not that i get all 3.  So I ordered the Blissful Fried Rice. When I went in to pick it up, it was ready and thats always a plus to not have to wait on an order that was called in 20 minutes prior.  I then ordered a Mumbai Spirit, or hot chai, and my total came to $10, and I left $1 tip.  When the cashier made my drink she poured a pre-made chai mix into a steaming pot, steamed it for a solid 4 seconds and poured it into what looked like it should be a childs cup, or water cup at any other place.  When she handed me the drink it felt like there was nothing in the cup but foam, and the paper it was made out of.  I opened it up to find that my childs size cup was only filled half way, and i asked her if I could have her fill the cup as I paid $3 for this drink. She told me thats how much you get if you eat in, therefor thats how much i get it if i take it to go.\\n\\nSo to round out my LAST experience at The Loving Hut, I paid $6 for a small container of rice with some bits of carrots, peas, tofu, and cilantro. I would say this order cost them a solid $0.75 to make, and my pre-made 3 1/2 sips of chai that was steamed to a foamy perfection, was maybe $0.40 because of the waste of paper cup.\\n\\n I REALLY wanted to be able to love this place and eat here often, as there are next to no vegetarian or vegan places around, but for the price I will happily go somewhere else like Mellow Mushroom, who have a few tofu, tempeh, and veggie items, and be able to pay the same prices for food that is delicous.\n"

I ordered the shrimp and crab noodle dish, which in the photo looked like it had hand-made noodles that resembled Korean potato dumplings. I got a pork and shrimp noodle soup with clear, thick noodles and had a lot of pork slices, chunks of pork blood and just two shrimp. When I pointed this out to the server, she said that they didn't have what was described on the menu and what I got was their substitute. But she neglected to tell me this when I ordered, even though it seemed she knew about the planned substitution because she wasn't even surprised when I brought up the differences. \\n\\nAt that point, I was so hungry that I just kept the dish, but if I had known what I would get, I would have ordered something else entirely. The restaurant gave me a 10% discount off my bill, which hardly made me feel better. What if I had dietary or religious reasons that prevented me from eating pork? \\n\\nThis is a real shame, because before this meal I liked the place and their food/service, and preferred eating there over all the other restaurants in the Mekong complex (which has a LOT of food options).

aS"I was near this part of town a while back and was wanting a nice little breakfast.  I saw this places was rated pretty high on yelp and figured I'd give it a go.  It looks pretty much just like any and every other coffee shop you've been into.  This nothing out of the ordinary about the looks, which if you are going for a coffee shop that's probably a good thing.  I ended up getting a double espresso and a slice of the quiche.  The quiche was heated up in the microwave and the coffee was served.  The food looked amazing but was far to under seasoned.  I guess they thought that the Parmesan cheese on top would be enough to season the entire thing, but they were really underestimating that.  The coffee was good, it's pretty hard to mess up an espresso.  \\n\\nI didn't rate it very good, but would I go back?  I think so.  I might give them another try, and get something other than the quiche.  Their baked good looked pretty good and their price wasn't crazy or anything.  If I'm in this area again I will probably stop by and they may make me change my review.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.\n"

aS'First off, the servers here are lifeless and lame. No personality and they look sour. They mope around and look like its a hassle for them to be at work. As I noticed the owner, it became clear why everyone is so unhappy. This man could easily be the most serious, grumpy, old man i have ever seen in a restaurant. He didnt have the friendly vibe going on at all.  If he is so unhappy, he should retire and get on the road!\\n\\nThe food is decent. I have definitely had more satisfying food for a less cost. Such as: the vig or mazies. \\n\\nIn conclusion - stuffy staff and overpriced lousy food.\n'

aS'"""We really wanted to like Lucille\'s, really, we did. I married a Southern boy, so as I was reading the online menu to him, he decided he really wanted to go. Unfortunately for Lucille\'s, we\'ve already been to Bobby Q\'s and Lucille\'s just does not stack up.\\n\\nDRINKS: Hubby had an interesting dark beer made by Albita Ale in Louisiana (although our server mistakenly said it was from Mississippi) called Turbo Dog which had some rich coffee tones. I am not usually a dark beer drinker, but I liked it too. I had the sweet tea which was served in a big mason jar with a sprig of fresh mint. It was sweet, but not LoLo\'s sweet (God love ya\' LoLo\'s, but you\'re not exactly helping prevent the diabetes!) and that\'s a good thing. \\n\\nAPPETIZERS: Hubby just had to have him some fried okra. I tried two pieces to be a good sport, but the interior texture is something I just can\'t get over. He thought it was delicious and preferred the mustard dipping sauce over the spicy ranch. We were also served some biscuits (which we both felt were also made with some corn meal and this made them a little tougher) and some \\apple butter\\"""" which was not really apple butter, but rather some sweetened butter tinged with cinnamon. Not impressive.\\n\\nMEAT: Hubby had the brisket and I had the tri-tip. The brisket is so far superior at Bobby Q\'s in terms of tenderness. Lucille\'s wasn\'t awful, though, and the \\""""mop sauce\\"""" which is different from the three sauces that were in bottles on the table (original, Memphis, and Hot  and  Spicy) was really good, and I usually don\'t like BBQ sauces. My tri-tip was very smoky in flavor, but rather dry. I asked for it dry (meaning no sauce) and was even challenged to do so by the menu itself which claimed that the true test of good BBQ was having it sauce-less. And so I did. And Lucille\'s did not pass the test on the tri-tip.\\n\\nSIDES: Hubby had shoestring fries which we both agreed were delicious, and also the peanut slaw, which is a vinegar based cole slaw tossed with peanuts and peanut oil. It also had large pieces of yellow and red bell pepper in it, which made it inedible for me, but Hubby thought it was quite tasty and certainly different from any slaw he\'d ever had.  I had the macaroni and cheese and roasted corn. The corn was delicious, but I had no idea it would be on the cob. At Bobby Q\'s, they roast it, slice it off the cob and serve it in a little bowl, which I prefer. The mac and cheese was an abomination for a place that claims to serve Southern food. I am not sure there was any real unprocessed cheese in it. I have had better from a Kraft Deluxe box.\\n\\nDESSERT: I am glad we tried the dessert because the banana pudding was the true standout. I have never had banana pudding that has not been from a can, so the homemade version at Lucille\'s was a treat. It had some pieces of fresh banana and vanilla wafers tossed throughout the large serving (more than enough for 2). It was topped with real whipped cream (not Redi-Whip).\\n\\nSERVICE: The service was quite good, attentive but not annoying. A manager stopped by our table toward the end, and Hubby made a comparison between Lucille\'s and Bobby Q\'s. The manager said that a few other managers had come over from Bobby\'s to Lucille\'s, and implied that something was amiss at Bobby\'s in the overall running of the place. Whatever that is, it is not overt, as Hubby and I never noticed that there was an issue with food quality or service at Bobby\'s. We decided that we\'ll give Lucille\'s 6 months to work out what we hope are some opening bugs, and we\'ll return to try again. In the meantime, you\'ll see us at Bobby\'s."""""""\n'

Because I like Whataburgers in general.\\n\\nI tried the Grilled Chicken Sandwich because I didn't want a burger and probably because that great southern sounding commercial voice was touting the excellence of this product in my subconscious.  \\n\\nIt was terrible.  I hope it's forgettable.  The bun is cloud-soft white bread.  IT came in its wrapper leaking ??, barbeque sauce and ??.  I don't know if that's part of the sandwich ambiance.  The chicken was worse than bad award banquet rubber chicken.  The BBQ sauce was industrial hickory.  One of those made-up flavors that I think is a BBQ flavor cliche.  It was not a pleasure.  I'm not sure if it was the chocolate shake, fries, or the sandwich itself, but the next day, it was a trip to Dr. Montzuma's for me.    Not a good dining experience.  I won't give it a 1 because they put out a good burger.  But for me, the chicken sandwich is what it is - bird DOA.\n"

This is the third time my family and I have gone there and the third time the service was excruciatingly slow.

Drinks arrived and our order was taken in a timely manner. . .so far, so good.\\nI\'m pretty sure that our server either forgot our ticket or the kitchen lost it because it doesn\'t take 35 minutes to drop an order of cheese sticks.  5 minutes in the fryer and you\'re done.

We did the whole \\look annoyed\\"""" thing but the wife noticed our server avoiding eye contact.  I stopped the hostess three time as she walked by for more drinks, which she graciously got us (making up for the seating fiasco)\\nThen I did something I don\'t normally do.  I asked for the manager.  I told him we love the food but this was the third time we had been there and the service was slow each time.  To his credit, he comped our entire meal (minus my beer.)  We leaned over to the table next to us that had 3 older couples out for dinner that had been waiting almost 40 minutes for their meals and told them we had been comped and they should complain too.  When we left they still hadn\'t been served. I sincerely hope they complained and got their meals for free too.  On our way out the manager was by the register and so was the hostess that helped us, I paid for the beer I had and tipped the hostess $20, telling her and the manager she actually did most of the serving, so she deserved the tip.  Come to think of it, I don\'t know what happened to our server because he didn\'t bring our food out to us and after we talked with the manager, we didn\'t see him anywhere in the place the rest of the time we were there.\\nI\'ll still order takeout and delivery from them as I\'ve never had a bad meal there, but my days of dining in at NYPD Pizza in Surprise are over."""""""\n'

What the hell? \\n\\nI know they've tried to class it up by bringing in different stores, and they have to an extent.  But it still attracts the thugs and my god, whatever you do, don't go to the Walmart.  It's the dirtiest, smelliest, most god forsaken place in the mall.  Stay far away. And if you happen to park right outside of it, be prepared to be accosted by a lady selling tamales and another lady selling creepy dolls. And while I can appreciate their entrepreneurial spirit, they're also more than a little pushy and aggressive. And it's also a little disconcerting to have someone follow you to your car wielding a pan of tamales. But trust me, if you park here, it will happen. \\n\\nThe food court is truly lacking and personally, if I were you, I'd take a nice leisurely drive up Lincoln, turn right on Scottsdale Road and spend the day at Scottsdale Fashion Square- where the fitting rooms aren't communal and you won't be asked to buy a creepy doll.\n"

aS'"""okay i have re-visited this place last saturday and was extremely unhappy with the fact that after eating a perfectly made crunch roll (made with real crabmeat) my california roll was rancid. I have to wonder if the server just forgot about it, and left it sitting on the bar for pickup, as it arrived about 20 minutes after our first one. my unhappiness and my the redistribution of stars is much more for the fact that, after asking our server to take it away and replace it with another crunch roll, he returned holding the roll and said \\that flavor is because this roll is made with imitaion crabmeat and real crabmeat, so there is a slightly different taste\\"""" i explained that it wasn\'t the flavor, but the taste of rancid old fish. i have to say that in my 15+ years of eating sushi, i have never been re-served rancid rolls. don\'t they know that because this is the desert, fish has to be flown in to be fresh, and at 11pm at night, when a customer tells you the fish is bad...it  more than likely is. so for all of you servers out there,  when a customer tells you the fish is rancid,  just replace it! i\'ll give them another chance, but it won\'t be for california rolls (how funny i normally don\'t even order them, but wanted to taste the difference from that and my favorite Crunch roll) serves me right for experimenting!\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1st review of Moira was this one....\\nfinally! a place where us late night eaters can go for some delicious and very well prepared sushi in downtown phoenix. i got an email with a note about the newly added happy hour menu (both regular and reverse) and was excited to go try a sampling of the artistic sushi i savored over while reading reviews and sampling experiences, in the local zines. i was surprised that we could arrive at 10:45pm on saturday and the kitchen would still be open with people eating and enjoying a late night rendevous. we sat at the sushi bar, on the most uncomfortable chairs you could ever imagine. the chairs look cool and fashionable, but i still have bruises on my legs from getting in and out of my metal box of a chair. i will never sit at the sushi bar again, so long as they have them chairs (dang one should never say never!) \\n\\nthe food was very fresh, colorful and artistic. the presentation and combinations are phenominal. the miso soup was so authentic and filled to the brim with tofu and cost less than $4 for a cup of tofu filled, yummy, light and fresh miso soup, dang you just can\'t go wrong! (lucky you tofu lovers-i\'m not a fan myself so this was actually a negative for me)\\n\\nI had the cucumber salad and must say, i was thrown for a loop with this one.  i\'m a cucumber salad (sunomono salad) loving fool if i gots to say so myself. Funny thing, i\'m not a fan of raw onions so my first reaction to the cucumber salad was \\""""YUKKIE\\"""" (just in my head) until i tasted it. the onions were so thin, that they tasted delicious in the salad. it added another bite to it, which was needed, because the dressing wasn\'t authentic in half vinegar to half sugar. they may be thinking of the diet craze, because there was much less sugar in it than there should have been, it was slightly vinegary. \\n\\ni was pleased with every roll i had! only brought home 2 pieces out of 3 rolls just for me. my sister played it safe and just ordered one roll, squid salad and miso soup. I have to say her squid salad was deo, but only a few bites for me please. \\n\\nthis is definitely a place for all occasions and all sizes of parties, from 1-10 people so utilize happy hour responsibly. get your group on at moira and your friends will love ya for introducing them to the most tasty dishes in town!"""""""\n'

Our dumb waitress Jennifer was barely around and we couldn\'t tell if she was our waitress or the dumb brunette there that could not stop giving us dirty looks.

Well thanks you asshole, but pretty sure I ordered a god damn coke, and not a beer.\\n\\nWhen we had gone to the bar before hand for a drink, I asked for a coke, (this bar is about a 10 seater so you can see everything) and he got everyone their alcoholic drinks, and left me without a drink. Even though, I was sitting directly in front of his \\work area\\"""".  Pretty sure you can see that my drink coaster is without a drink.\\n\\nNow to tell you about the horrible food that came out COLD.  The spinach dip was discusting too.  Didn\'t have any silverware, napkins or side plates untill half way through the meal.  Couldn\'t get a refill on ANY of our drinks.  I had my empty soda glass sitting at the head of the table and she walks by, \\""""need anything else?\\"""" and the glass is sitting right in front of her.  Uh yeah....She added someone elses tab onto our bill without saying anything or asking.  Then took her a lifetime to put it on a seperate bill.  All in all, everything was just insanely horrible.  Worse than denny\'s and sorry guys, but that means A LOT.\\n\\nLet it be known, we\'re in an economic depression right now, and the first businesses to feel that depression is restaurants, and as a server, you gotta milk every table that you\'re lucky enough to get as much as you can, because those restaurant doors could be closed the next day for good."""""""\n'

He explained that they smoke everything before, then finish it on the grill to order. Obviously ours weren't grilled much (or at all).

My banh mi bellwether is definitely Lee's Sandwiches, but Chandler is quite the trek for me, so I've been on the lookout for good banh mi in CenPho.  I read about Thao's Sandwiches here on Yelp and thought I'd give it a shot for lunch yesterday.\\n\\nBy far, the best part of my Thao's experience was the price.  I ordered a grilled pork (thit nuong) banh mi, and it cost me all of $2.71.  It's hard to complain about anything if you're out less than $5.00.  The sandwich's innards were all delicious.  The vegetables were fresh and pleasing to the eye, and the grilled pork was thinly sliced, as I like it.  As far as the inside of my sandwich, I'd give it 4 stars.  \\n\\nBut my favorite part of bahn mi is the bread, and the bread at Thaos did not meet expectation yesterday.  I want my banh mi bread crispy on the outside and soft below the crunchy crust.  The Thao bread was uniformly soft - it was like a Vietnamese torta or something.  And that made me sad.  I really wanted to look past that, but it was impossible for me.\\n\\nAlso, the customer service left a lot to be desired.  It seems like Vietnamese establishments sometimes get a pass on this criteria, but they shouldn't.  I ordered my sandwich, and when I told the woman at the cash register that I was planning on eating it on site, she gave an exasperated sigh, and looked across the restaurant, scanning - it was evident there were several four tops available, but it was almost lunch time, and I think she felt like I'd take up space better used by a group larger than my one-man party.  I didn't want to disappoint her, so I told her I'd take the sandwich to go, and brought it home instead.  Oh well.\\n\\nSo overall, I give Thao's two stars - if the bread were better, I suppose I could have given it a third. But I'll keep on my quest for the best banh mi in town, and likely not return.\n"

We were expected to bus our own table for this lack luster overpriced food. Sorry won't be going back!!\n"

aS"I just now got back from a group lunch at Havana Cafe. Terrible Visit.\\n\\nUnbelievably SLOW  service (a TWO HOUR lunch? Are you serious?) and the food wasn't that great. I was really disappointed. I have been DYING to try Havana Cafe for a few weeks now and finally got my lunch buddies to go.\\n\\nWe arrived at the restaurant at 12:09pm which I know for certain because I received a text at that time. We were seated and we ordered our drinks. By the time our drinks came everyone was ready to order their meal. We waited almost an hour before the bread basket was plopped on our table. We were expecting our meals shortly after. Our food was served to us over 1 hour after our arrival. \\n\\nI ordered the San Juan Combination plate that came with a little of everything. How do I say this nicely? Um, I don't think I will be ordering that again. The Pastele was old and dry. Usually when you cut into a tamal or pastele, it doesn't crumble or break. Mine did. The mofongo seemed like it was sat to dry out. It came out in two mounds and both mounds were greasy and dry (is that possible? yes.) The alcapurrias were tasty and tangy. Still a little greasy for my taste, but they were ok. I mean you can't wring out deep fried food. The tostones were not good. Again, something that was left to dry out. They were neither crispy nor edible. They were fried all to hell and I couldn't eat them. I took one bite of them and sat them aside. They made a lovely garnish though. The arroz con gandules was the highlight of the plate. The beans and rice were tender and tasty and the olives and capers gave the dish just enough zip. The masas de puerco fritas were greasy little chunks of pork that were ok once I dipped them in the mojo. \\n\\nAll of us were underwhelmed with our meals. Nothing spectacular nothing amazing, and everyone commented that things were cold, or greasy.\\n\\nNext long wait, the check to be paid. We decided to split the check 6 ways. Easy right? Wrong. It took another 15 minutes to get that done. Just an FYI, parties of 6 or more get an automatic gratuity on their bill. The service was awful and I think 18% gratuity was very generous. We left at 2:08pm.\\n\\nI don't know if I'm brave enough to give Havana Cafe a try again. I might go back to try their drinks. Usually a good amount of alcohol makes anything taste good so that might boost their rating up a bit. \\n\\nI was really looking forward to Havana Cafe, but my friends and I agree that this place was disappointing.\n"

Two of us ordered sandwiches which were said to be made with a \\zesty horseradish sauce,\\"""" which he and I both commented was gross and unlike any horseradish we had ever had.  I normally love horseradish, especially on my roast beef sandwiches, so I actually asked the PB employee to make mine with extra horseradish.

aS"They should change their name to Fresh, Easy and Fatty.\\n\\nAre you kidding me?  After all the rave reviews of Fresh and Easy,  I waited for the dust to settle and ventured there today only to find it is a major disappointment.  I find this is a view not shared by several of my friends and many trusted fellow reviewers.  \\n\\nFrom many comments I expected a Trader Hoe's type place where I would also have to stop at a Fry's to get everything else...your basics.  Well, it is that to a degree, just not as good in terms of price, quality or health as TJ's.\\n\\nI have never cared for pre-packaged fruit and vegetables -- which admittedly is a criticism I have of Trader Joe's also.  I love being able to select and decide which orange is to my liking at a place like Fry's.\\n\\nMy biggest criticism, however, would have to be its incredibly unhealthy take-and-go food selection.  This is where TJ's has them beat.  Sandwiches all weighed in at 50+ fat grams.  An average person's total daily recommended allowance is something like 67 fat grams, so eat the sandwich reeeaaalllly slowly and savor it for the rest of the day.\\n\\nFor a store that prides itself on ecologically-sensitive gestures such as grocery bag recycling, organic foods, priority parking for hybrid vehicles, etc, etc., I was shocked to see how poor their nutrition facts weighed in on many foods -- making a triple bacon cheeseburger look like Lean Cuisine.  Where's the social responsibility in that? \\n\\nSmall 8 ounce containers of chicken salad measured at 88 fat grams and 980 calories are more offensive than slightly higher prices or the absence of ecological gestures would have been.  I mean, seriously, is there any chicken product in that salad at all, or is it just a tub of lard with chicken seasoning?  Perhaps this is some sort of sick joke the Brits are making at their fat-ass American counterparts.\\n\\nI left the store with some fruit salad, organic lemonade and a spicy shrimp roll (which, btw was just as awful as TJ's sushi).  I found that the pricing was no different on many items and in many instances was more expensive at F and E.\\n\\nSorry Fresh and Easy, I don't buy it and I won't buy it.  Trader Joe's, where are you baby?  I'm a coming running back to you.\n"

aS'"""\\Why am I here?\\"""" was the only thing I could think of while standing on the handicap ramp in a very crowded, very poorly chosen location. \\n\\nI\'ve thought about the positives: Expansive craft beer selection, relatively quick service considering the space constraints and crowd size, live music, and lots of guest brewers coming in (shout-out to Four Peaks!). \\n\\nBut after considering all of these positives, I was still standing on a ramp with a $7 Brewdog IPA (which is amazing) in hand questioning why in the world they would put this great of a concept in this terrible of a location. \\n\\nI can\'t help but to think that World of Beer Inc. saw an opportunity to capitalize on the craft beer culture that has been pioneered by the likes of The Roosevelt Tavern, Four Peaks, Papago Brewing and Taste of Tops (among others), and forced their corporate concept on to Mill Ave in to whatever space they could find. \\n\\nIt should be noted that this Florida-based company is being run by the former management of Outback Steakhouse.

aS'"""EDIT:  7/14/2012  -- I was contacted by a restaurant representative through Yelp regarding this review.   The message included an apology for my experience and said they wanted me to contact their customer service by email so they could \\reach out\\"""" to me.  I sent off an email over a week and a half ago and they still have not \\""""reached out\\"""" to me.\\n\\nMy review:\\n\\nUsually a disappointing experience when I go, and I\'ll likely not go back.  \\n\\nFood is okay.  It\'s why they get a grudging 2 stars.  It\'s family-style so they bring a big platter or bowl of what you order and everyone serves themselves.  I don\'t mind that.  Though one thing that\'s kind of annoying is that you have to order side dishes as an extra with your entree.  For example, if you order a platter of chicken parmesan, you just get a platter of chicken pieces and nothing else.  If you want some pasta or potatoes to go with it, you have to make sure you add it on as an extra dish.  Would it be so hard for them to put a combo-type offering on the menu so you get an entree platter with a side dish?  Even if we pay the same amount as ordering it separately, it\'s still a perceived value and wouldn\'t make customers feel like they\'re paying \\""""extra\' for something that seems like it should be included with a meal.\\n\\nService is either very poor or just okay.  Servers seem to all be rushed and busy, like they\'re too overloaded to do a good job.  Each time I\'ve gone, I\'ve had messed up orders.  Once, we ordered cappuccinos before the meal, and the server went and came four times before he brought them during the middle of our meal...and only after I reminded him the first three times he had come back and kept forgetting the coffees.  When he finally brought them he made an excuse, saying he was busy and the coffee machine was very far away from our table.  Yeah.  Last time, I was with a party of 5.  After we ordered our meals, one of them got to the table very quickly (turned out he brought it to the wrong table and it was supposed to go to the table next to us), while the next three meals came out 30 minutes later, and the last meal, my meal, actually never came out!!  He seemed to forget mine and when asked about it, hardly seemed apologetic at all, just a tad embarrassed, and just said that the kitchen didn\'t have any of the dish I wanted.  Seriously!?!  He couldn\'t tell me that earlier?  I ordered another dish to-go since my party was nearly finished eating.  But then he came back a minute later and said he checked with the kitchen and they actually did have my original dish.  Ugh.  What a nightmare of a server.  So after all that, I did get my dish to-go.  Nothing was taken off my ticket, though they gave us one dessert for free for the 5 of us to share.  Pretty lame.\\n\\nBottom line:  Poor service.  Food is okay, but not good enough to overlook the service.  If you\'re craving good pasta, spend your hard-earned money at a different Italian restaurant that appreciates their customers."""""""\n'

aS"We decided to take our parents out for dinner only to be disappointed by the loud music which caused everyone in the restaurant to have to talk louder to be heard. My mom took out her hearing aids! When I mentioned this to our server, she just smiled. The wait staff was plentiful, but not attentive. The chips were not warm and I had to ask for salsa twice which came in plastic squeeze bottles. Really? Not the best. The tacos were small, but good. My husband's meal was not served at the same time as ours and we thought they forgot about it. No mention of his coming out soon even. Needless to say, we won't be back!\n"

First, they'll ask you what type of bread you want.  On my reuben?  I'll take rye, because if it isn't rye then it's not a reuben.  Thank you.\\n\\nThen they will include lunch meat-style corned beef, which just pisses me off.  Because it doesn't taste delicious, it tastes like what you get from a cafeteria.  And then they have thick ass bread, which, in my opinion, is what you put on a sandwich when you don't want people to realize that what's in between the slices of bread sucks ass.\\n\\nOr, the nachos.  They use movie theater cheese (which is a one-star bonus for me, only reason they have 2 stars) but the chili is totally tasteless.  I don't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing.  Not bad, not good, just *nothing.*  Here's a tip: find something that tastes and heave it into the pot.  Just a thought.\\n\\nI hate myself for being convinced to go here over slices.

aS'"""Unfortunately, my experience was much similar to Mark\'s. The staff was indeed friendly, but entirely unequipped to provide proper attention to a patient\'s individual needs. My therapist, Melissa, was nice, but after the initial assessment she failed to explain in any detail the source of my pain, where it might have come from or illustrate a course of action. Instead, I was handed a sheet of exercises that looked like I could have printed it off of Google.\\n\\nMelissa often had more than one patient scheduled during our appointments. I would arrive, and she would have me work on a machine while she saw to someone else. On multiple occasions I would spend entire minutes sitting, motionless, waiting for Melissa to come back and instruct me. This is \\treatment\\"""" - time that I was billed for! This did not seem to be the case with Melissa alone, either. At almost all times there were at least six patients for a total of two or three therapists. One morning a woman even brought her labrador into the treatment room and it proceeded to bound around, off-leash, for her entire session. I\'m a dog lover as much as the next person, but it\'s bad enough I have to share precious time with other members of the same species, much less a dog!\\n\\nUltimately, I received no relief, no specialized attention and no care. I stopped treatment after three visits and would not recommend this clinic. In addition, as Mark said, be sure to read the \\""""Welcome\\"""" form - it will inform you what your insurance deductible is and how much has been met. Under my plan, previous chiropractic and physical therapy treatments had not been subject to a deductible, but my benefits had recently changed. I was shocked to get a bill in the mail for $570! That is an outrageous amount to pay for such poor care: patients need to be informed of what mediocre medical treatment will cost them. \\n\\nI will add that, after expressing my dissatisfaction to the Patient Services manager, she was quick to respond and offer a resolution that I thought was fair. As stated before, the entire staff is courteous and patient, but I would caution that it may be worth your time to seek treatment elsewhere."""""""\n'

The taco meal which is 3 tacos, and a kids cheese crisp cost just short of 12 bucks. Way to much considering more that half of it went in the trash. Yuck, will never go back.

I can get a far larger burger at Fudruckers for the same price.\\n\\nSo now about quality.  For less money the In and Out burger is far better quality.  For the same amount of money the Fudruckers is far better quality.\\n\\nNone of the above is to say that the burger here was bad.  Rather, you can get better quality for less or the same elsewhere.  The only thing unique here is how they cook the hamburger.

When the movers arrived, they did not bring any packing materials or the boxes I told the owner I would need (isn\'t it also standard practice to bring packing materials... just in case???).

(Hello...! Can you say \\""""customer service\\""""? NOT). He then commenced to quote a conversation we did not have and practically  accused me of fabricating my story.  He not only did not want to accommodate me in any way, he was rude, defensive, offensive, nasty and just plain unprofessional. I chose to inform him that the conversation was going to go nowhere and that I was going to get off the phone, which I did. To which he responded... wait for it.... by telling the movers to WALK AWAY FROM THE JOB. They did not want to , but didn\'t want to get fired either. Then I was told that if I paid in cash they would do the move. Then the owner called back the movers and told them TO REMOVE MY THINGS FROM THE TRUCK AND WALK AWAY FROM THE JOB.  Leaving me and my 94 year old mother who is on oxygen to fend for ourselves. They followed orders. They took all of our things off of the truck, brought them back to her assisted living apartment and drove away. The drivers were mortified, as were we. They were just following orders, so I do not blame them. But the unconscionable actions of the owner are grounds for a lawsuit, as well as a complaint to the BBB, which I fully intend to pursue.

I asked about bar seating and she said that the bar seating is full menu service.\\n\\nI sat down at the bar and was sitting there about 10 minutes before I could get a bartender\'s attention.  A female batender walked to the end of the bar where I was sitting and I asked her for an iced tea and menu.  She brought my iced tea and menu about 5 minutes later.  I waited another 10 minutes before I could get her attention (she was at the other end of the bar chatting it up with some patrons) to tell her I was ready to place my dinner order (at this time, I needed a refill on my iced tea).  The female bartender disappeared right after I told her I would have the prime rib medium rare; I did not even get a chance to also request a refill on my iced tea because she left.  About 10 minutes later, a helper from the kitchen comes out with my prime rib and sits it down on the bar in front of me.  I asked him if I could get a refill on my iced tea and he said that he would tell the bartender and disappeared.  The female bartender was still on the other end of the bar chatting it up with the same patrons/not even looking in my direction so I asked a male bartender, Daniel, that was chatting it up with a group of guys if I could get a refill on my iced tea.  About 5 minutes later he brings the iced tea. The vegetables that came with the prime rib were not what I expected (had some vinegar stuff poured on them and I cannot eat vinegar; menu did not say that vegetables would be drenched in a vinegarette dressing); I was hoping to get a side salad swapped out since I could not eat the vegetables.  About a third of my steak had been consumed and I stopped and was waiting to get Daniel\'s attention (he was still chatting it up with the group of guys) and a helper from the kitchen came up and was trying to take my plate (thought I was finished).  I told the helper that I would need a box (wanted to at least take the rest of the prime rib home).  Daniel appeared with a plastic take home container for me to put my prime rib in along with the bill.  I asked if I could get an iced tea to go and Daniel informed me that they do not do \\to go\\"""" beverages.\\n\\nI tipped 15% (I usually tip 20-25%) put was even hesitant to tip the 15%.  No one ever checked with me to see if everything was ok (food, needed a refill on my beverage).  Original bartender walked away and left me to fend on my own to find another bartender to wait on me. Other bartender completely ignored me/would not even look in my direction.  \\n\\nPrime rib was good but not worth the $43 tab for a piece of prime rib, 2 iced teas and lack of service.  This place is trendy; if you are not a friend of the bartender, not a regular customer that the staff is familar with (and not ordering unlimited alcoholic drinks), do not expect to get any service or attention.  I will not be back and do not recommend."""""""\n'

aS"We came here a couple of weeks ago for reverse hh on a friday and sat at the bar to take advantage of the HH.   Mr h ordered the Brio burger and I ordered the margherita flatbread, both apps were below average apps. The burger was bland and the Hubster ordered med well and added saut\\u00e9ed onions. the burger was served well with charred onions.\\nmy pizza seemed more like a thin flavorless cracker mess. I like thin pizza but this was way too thin and falling apart. We both ordered the mojitos  and  they were so disgusting we had to send those back.  the bartender took it personally but they were super bitter and nasty and we could not enjoy them.  I understand it's happy hour and its super busy on Fridays, affordable drinks  and  apps but if you want me to return...please serve some tasty food so I will be tempted to have dinner here in the future.  I doubt I will be returning.\n"

I feel like it should be a rule at any Mexican restaurant that chips and salsa are free. Yet we ordered some--a small order with 3 small bland salsas. We also tried the ceviche...nothing to write home about...in other words don't waste your time. The calamari was tender but only came with 4 strips. For dinner one guest had the burger which got pretty good reviews, as did the fajitas. I had the stuffed peppers not much to say about that.

The natural soda pop was great and the sweet potato fries also were very good. No patio ... that's a problem especially with heavy A/C. They did try to take our plates a million times.

It feels like an over-hyped, somewhat overpriced sandwich place that just doesn\'t hit the mark for me.  I\'m not a big sandwich person anyway and their salads leave something to be desired. They are soaked in too much dressing, odd tasting chicken with a somewhat slimy texture and I don\'t like the set-up of their counter service.\\n\\nMy mom was in town and she likes PB, so we shared a southwest chicken sandwich on a ciabatta roll and a southwest ceasar salad, maybe too much \\""""southwest\\"""" in one meal, but it all tasted over dressed and the bread was tasteless.  She looked at me and said \\""""we should have gone to Y.C.\'s Mongolian BBQ for the same price.\\""""  I would have to agree.

aS"I had only eaten at La Fonda's Mexican food restaurant three times. The first two experiences there were great. The staff during the day is the family that actually owns the business. The service was fast, food was hot and fresh, and waiter was friendly. However, the third time I ate there was for dinner with a friend of mine. We got there and had to wait around 20 minutes for a table. The reason being is it was a Saturday night and   the place had only two servers for the whole restaurant! What a nightmare! We decided to stay and have dinner since it was already 7 pm. We both ordered there standard margarita there which tasted like salt water....no flavor! Our chips and salsa were good like the other two previous visits prior. The chicken burritos we ordered were a disappointment. The meat inside was luke warm which made me a bit nervous. How long was the meat sitting? We were so disappointed we just up and walked out, never been back since. give this place a second thought before trying them out. it seems like a hit or miss kinda restaurant.\n"

aS"Despite delicious food and an impressive wine list, it hurts my heart to say that this place isn't worth the trouble. The staff is pretentious and unaccommodating. I have been here a handful of times and every server I have had has an excuse of why they cannot meet my requests. I understand a policy of not splitting checks, but then please let us know that when you are taking our order. One of the servers also told me that they cannot seat parties of five without a reservation. I understand having to wait for a table, but the place was just opening and nearly empty at the time. The menu also gives very vague descriptions making it nearly impossible for anyone with specific food allergies. I love my wine, but I am pretty comfortable with the fact that I will never go to this place again.\n"

After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.

aS'"""I\'m in the market for a good place to become a regular so I tried here its close to where I work so I tried. I went in for a pedi and a gel mani and a brow wax, with my friend who also wanted all the same services besides the wax we were both seated at the same time starting with our pedis.\\n\\nMy experience - the Woman who did my pedi was great talked, and friendly she was great. I stand all day and it showed on my feet, she removed every callus and did everything that went with the ultimate pedi polished my toes great! Then the ladies switched my lady went to do my friends gel mani and I went to do my brows with the lady that had just worked on my friend, she took me in the back rudely told me to hurry up and lay down, despite the fact that my friend and I were the only two there, she did my brows quickly and burned me with the wax I told her and she put cooling gel on the area and then rushed me out to start my gel mani, she told me to chose a color I asked if they had more because they are very limited, anyways I pick and she dose everything and starts to put the gel on and gets it all over on the sides of my nails and still try\'s to tell me to stick my hand under the light I tell her about the mess and ask her to fix it, she tells me no it will be ok, I repeat myself and she yanks my hand and scrapes away the gel with her nail and I\'ve never been hurt by that before but she hurt me then says now better while rolling her eyes she dose the other side and the same thing after two coats I want it a bit darker so I ask for one more coat and she tells me \\ no, I don\'t want to use it up\\"""" I insist so she does after sighing and rolling her eyes again and they are done.\\n\\nMy friends experience- the woman who did her feet was asking about her old polish and why she would chose that color (it was dark silver with a white flower) she told her I had a big date and it matched my dress.. The woman says \\""""oh its just an ugly color\\"""". This woman hurt my friend by stabbing under her big toe nail when she was suppose to be cleaning under it. She told the woman and the woman did not even apologies but said \\""""oh but you moved\\"""" anyway she did everything and polished her toes, she asked the woman for a flower and the woman rolled her eyes, but did it. And then the lady that had just finished my pedi went to do my friends gel mani, she was done by the time had finished my brows But she said she was nice and told here about the shop and talked about random things.\\n\\nWhen we were all done we went to the mirror that lines the wall and to show each other the work, and I wanted to look at my brows again they kinda hurt, when I got to the mirror I realized my gels were horrible bumpy and didn\'t completely cover my nails in some places and in others were still in the outter edges of my nails. And I looked at my friends toes and her design was kinda smudged and looked really cheap It didn\'t look like a flower but a little bush on her toe, my friend said I know I don\'t like it either but wouldn\'t say anything about it. Then I looked into the mirror to look at my brows and realized right away why they hurt she had not only burned me but torn off my skin in the process! I was very upset and spoke to the lady that did them about it and asked her to remove it from the bill she refused, I ended up paying for them anyways, I,looked at my toes kinda expecting the worse after seeing my nails but my toes were great and my friends gels were perfect! \\n\\nWhen I went to pay it was 80 something not bad of a price but I only had a large bill so I handed it over and waited for my change , the lady (the same lady that burned me) said \\"""" and I keep the change?\\"""" I told her no I want my change. She sighed and rolled her eyes but gave me my change I tipped my pedi lady, and gave the other lady half the amount. My friend took care of her tip, and the great pedi lady said goodbye and the one that burned me walked away without another word sighing as she went.\\n\\nMy friend later told me that the rude lady , the one that did her feet and my gels and my brows was the MANAGER of the store, that\'s what my pedi lady was telling her when she did her gels! This made me even more upset and at all the bad complaints I had and told her about from the manicure to the wax burn to the torn skin , and she never once said anything I\'m defiantly not looking for a hand out or anything but I\'ve worked in the customer service industry for a few years now and I would never treat my customers the way she treated us! Even a simple I\'m sorry would have sufficed! SO all in all I would not recommend this place to anyone yes the lady that did my pedi was great but I can\'t remember her name so i wont go back and i do not want to go to any establishment were the manager is rude and has bad customer service!"""""""\n'

The zucchini fries are triumphant. Truly wonderful. The burgers sound amazing when reading them but more than once they've come out just OK. Nothing terrible, but not as mouthwatering as they made them sound. I like how the wine list is portioned out too... pretty cut and dry. Don't bother asking your server about the wines though, they probably will just look at you with a stupid look on their face. \\n\\nIf you're with a big burger person and you're not a burger person, do not fret. They have TWO really good salads, so don't get too excited. My favorite is the one with pomegranate seeds and goat cheese, with or without chicken. Its very light and fresh. \\n\\nOn my last occasion my server was slow, meek, and dull. Having zero personality is one thing, but when she realized she forgot about my glass of wine and I had to remind her (about ten minutes later) she became very timid and hardly even came back to our table! I wasn't rude.. so I don't understand why she had a manager come by to drop it off.

For almost $17 I was hard pressed to find any chicken or bacon in my chopped Cobb salad. Zero blue cheese.

I panicked for only a short while til I realized they were going overboard on the fact that my pedals are not where most pedals are since my bike doesn't have much of a frame in the center. The employee kept going on about how it must be awkward to pedal (which it's not) and then called other employees over to gawk and make odd comments about my bike. \\n\\nFunny enough on the way out a woman drooled over my gorgeous bike with its interesting design and asked where I got it.

In our case, we were given the impression that we'd have to wait about 20 minutes for our little group.  On the phone they did tell us that there was another party ahead of us.  What they didn't tell us was that it would really be more like the 20 minutes times 3 for the four adults and two kiddos.

Not for us, of course, and nobody was leaving anytime soon.\\n\\nWhile we waited, a party of two walked in and was seated.  A few minutes later, another two-top near them turned over.  A little forward thinking would have been to seat the two at one of the other open tables, and put the other now free tables together.   It would have been a tight fit, but it could have worked.\\n\\nNeedless to say, The Breadfruit is small.  There is no waiting area and with the kiddos we weren't going to wait outside in the drizzle.  We waited in a hallway that lead to the bathroom until we couldn't wait anymore.

I had a veggie burger - that was a little to greasy for my liking but props b/c it was freshly made - not frozen. The Gazpacho Shirmp cocktail was de-lish. My friend had the couscous salad and liked it.\\n\\nWould I go back - yes.\\nWould I recommend it - yes\\nWould I go back again and again - probably not.\n'

aS"Have been finding myself stuck in the Phoenix airport more than I'd wish. And, this was close to my gate (B16), but wish I would have walked someplace further.  \\n\\nOrdered the fish and chips - primarily for the coleslaw and it was served in a condiment cup - literally two small fork fulls - and not much flavor.  The fish was fishy (yuck). They were served with waffle fries which made up most of the plate.  I wanted malt vinegar, but my server was non-existent.  I visited at an off hour (2:00ish) so maybe she just forgot that I was there.  Since I had time to kill the slow service didn't hurt me, but if you're in a hurry I'd avoid this place.  \\n\\nOverall - overpriced - with my iced tea it came to $18.  Not worth the price. The sad thing is that I think it would have been better to eat at Burger King.  : (\n"

aS'"""I had a flight booked for me to go to training for a new job...When I learned that I would be flying US Airways I was not thrilled in the least. I\'ve flown US Air a few times, some personal (including my honeymoon) and twice for business. \\n\\nFor this trip I checked in online and had boarding passes sent to my phone. I don\'t check bags with US Air (more on this later), and I wanted nothing to do with their \\customer service staff\\"""". With me I had a carry on suitcase and a garment bag. As I boarded the first flight, I asked if they could hang my garment bag for me. Every airline I\'ve ever traveled on has a place in the front to hang a bag like this. Not US Air. The lady said \\""""are you in 1st class?\\"""" I said no. \\""""Well if you\'re not in first class, we won\'t hang it for you. You\'ll need to put it under your seat because this is a full flight.\\"""" OK...No worries, as I love a wrinkly suit. Other than that there wasn\'t much notable about the flight. (Side note: if you have a smart phone, you should 100% do mobile tickets every time you fly...Life changing.)\\n\\nRewind a few years, to two really awful experiences. First, we flew US Airways to Jamaica from Portland, OR in August of 2008. This was the height of terrible fuel prices and a recession, and US Air wouldn\'t let you forget it. $30 per checked bag, and they were charging $2.00 for sodas on the plane. TWO DOLLARS FOR A SODA? I\'m paying out the ass for a ticket and my bags, and you\'re going to charge me $2 for what should be a free Sprite? I went thirsty in silent protest of such horrible business practices.\\n\\nIn addition, a couple years ago I flew US Air on business and they lost my bag on the return flight. I returned late on a Friday night and didn\'t have my bag until Sunday...The service at the airport and over the phone was really atrocious. I know that lost baggage people have the worst jobs on earth, but there wasn\'t even a hint of compassion or \\""""hey sorry we messed up\\"""". That\'s why I\'ll never check bags with them again, and also because I don\'t trust them to keep my belongings safe...\\n\\nI will never, ever voluntarily fly US Air. I\'ll happily pay more just to avoid them. Do not recommend."""""""\n'

Everyone else was there for the scene.  What has been said here is true.  It is loud music, loud people, over the top decor.\\n\\nWe sat at the sushi counter, not because they were busy, but mostly because we couldn\'t get the host\'s attention.  The \\""""chef\\"""" (and I use that term generously here) who was in front of us had completely no idea what he was doing.  Granted he said he was new there, but he took our order sheet and handed it off to the next guy because he said he couldn\'t handle it.  I can understand \\""""I\'m still learning the ropes.\\"""" so I cut him some slack and tried to make conversation.  \\""""So, do you like to make sushi at home.\\""""  \\""""No, I\'ve never made sushi before, but I like to eat it.\\""""  You do not get to stand in front of customers, profess you know nothing, and cut cream cheese for a 1/2 hour.  Yuck!\\n\\nWe ordered: toro sashimi, hamachi sashimi, saba oshi sushi, uni sashimi, some crispy-spicy tuna thing, and some veggie tempura.  \\n\\nThe saba oshi sushi completely threw them.  Why even have a special order line if you can only make the 7 or 8 standard items you have on the menu?  So the \\""""experienced chef\\"""" to whom the menu was handed said, \\""""you want saba sushi\\""""?  I wanted to be clear so I said, \\""""Mackerel OSHI sushi, you know, box pressed Mackerel.\\""""  I got the \\""""Oh, ok\\"""" but I was skeptical.  Then he kept asking me crazy questions, \\""""You want that with rice? Are you sure you just want Mackerel? No other fish with that?\\""""  I offered to just let him give us Saba Nigiri, much simpler.  If you don\'t have the box or you can\'t do oshi sushi, no problem - I gave him every out.  We basically ended up with Saba Don - nothing like what I ordered and no willingness to admit none of them had any idea what they were doing.  And it was way sub par saba at that.\\n\\nSo, they were out of the toro.  No apologies, just \\""""We don\'t have that.\\"""" We tried to order the scallop dish as a substitute, but that never came.  In the end, all the better I figure.\\n\\nThe crispy-spicy tuna thing was almost ok.  Except the spicy was mostly jalapeno and just totally wrong for the dish and the crispy stuck to my teeth.\\n\\nThe tempura was the only thing that was close to good.  It was too thickly battered though and didn\'t come close to tempura at its finest.\\n\\nThe uni was gross.  I took one bite and left it there.  It was slimy and not fresh at all.  I didn\'t realize when I walked in, but I really shouldn\'t have ordered it.  This is not the place anyone who cares about fresh fish really eats.  The uni was never going to be a big seller or any good at a place like this.  This is where people go to drink silly fru fru drinks, eat exorbitant rolls that don\'t even resemble sushi, and to have their conversation drown out by loud music so they don\'t even have to think.\\n\\nOK on top of it being a horrible experience, the fish just sucked.

aS'On the day I visited, many of the exhibits and galleries were closed due to one reason or another--preparing for a fundraiser, renovation. The Contemporary Art collection was really limited and unimaginative. There were very few multimedia works, or multidimensional works. There was a lackluster collection of coture clothing which were not contextualized in any way, shape, or form. Why would these clothes be art? No clue there. Frankly, smaller museums such as the Denver Museum of Art/Albuquerque Museum, and the Panhandle Plains Museum, do far better in their breadth and depth, respectively.\\n\\nThe only really good thing about the Phoenix Art Museum are their grounds.

aS"I've been debating about writing this review.  I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????\n"

aS'"""I\'m always in the mood for a good sandwich, so I stopped by Mike\'s.  As anxious as I was, I was STUNNED by the sky-high prices for what you get.  I mean, how good can a sandwich be to command 30% over market value, and 30% under volume consumed?  \\n\\nThe bun was 70% of the presentation, and although the buns are worthy and important, they should be 20%.  The meat and cheese should be at least 50% of the value for the sandwich.  Any good consumer knows that.\\n\\nHere we go, with no need to elaborate---  The outcome of the big 3:\\n\\nService:  \\nThis part was average, and it\'s what you would expect at a busy sandwich shop.  We were 3rd in line, and it was 7 minutes before we walked out the door.\\n\\nTaste:  I liked the taste, although I was expecting SO MUCH MORE because of the hype that they put into their t.v. commercials.  After hearing the commercial, I expected them to be the most-perfect sub, just like they said.  The bun is 70% of the sub, and while soft and tasty, should\'ve been 20% of the sub.  \\n\\nIt was just O.K., and it\'s fine for a quick bite at a sub shop.  Don\'t expect the meat and cheese to overpower the taste, since it\'s such a meager and marginal portion of the entire sub.\\n\\nPrice:  Welcome to the \'horrendous part\' of the entire ordeal.  I have no problem paying $5 for a delicious sub.  One of the market leaders has been doing $5 subs for years, and I\'ve often wondered why any other competitors that want to be market leaders haven\'t driven the price down AT ALL.  I expect that they don\'t want to compete in an American workplace, that is expected to be DRIVEN BY PRICE.\\n\\nI would even give $10 for the most fantastic sub, like the ones that New Yorkers RAVE about the subs in New York.  Since this is a New Jersey import, I have HUGE problems paying $9 to walk out with an average sub + fixin\'s.  I\'d have no problem unless, of course, Chandler had a average, upper-class wage compared to New Jersey\'s upper-class wage.  You\'ll notice that they are NOT the same, and you\'ll find that they are VASTLY different.\\n\\nIf this sub would\'ve \'rocked my world\', then it\'s totally worth a $10 fee to escape with their fixin\'s.  As it was, I was left with a sub-standard sub (less than 12\\) and with normal, wholesome, expected, and anti-climatic fixin\'s.  A big let-down from what their commercials INSIST are the best.\\n\\nSummary:\\nThis shop is overpriced, and they don\'t get it.  They EXPECT that this is what you SHOULD pay for a \'premium\' sub.  The trouble is, that Chandler is NOT Scottsdale, New York, nor New Jersey, and they haven\'t factored in the DESIRED sub shop that should be operating in a college community.  (we don\'t need more Scottsdale-type pricing, just college-kid pricing with college-kid type portions).  \\n\\nI doubt that the owners will agree, and also, please expect that the owners will maintain that they are \\""""...doing a good thing...\\"""" for the residents of the area.  Please disregard their fantasy leanings, since they don\'t understand the undergraduate population.\\n\\nAs far as stereotypes coming out of New Jersey, I\'m also sure that these owners, just like the aggressive, post-WW2 unions, would ACTIVELY seek to prevent you from hearing what I\'ve said about their food in this article.  I\'m also convinced that they would also ADAMANTLY deny any affiliation with union henchmen.\\n\\nViva la America!"""""""\n'

aS"It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment, but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyone.\\n\\nYes, this may be a bit of a rant, so in an attempt to be balanced, let me offer a little perspective.\\n\\nPizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year. The food is very good. The service is good, but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed, in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table. It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar, and I have done so on many occasions. The wine selection is above average, and the environment is pleasant.\\n\\nHowever, the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees), and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable. The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.\\n\\nAs a fan of excellent food, I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft. But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptable.\\n\\nWhile I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not, irreplaceable I might add), after many months of consistent patronage, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.\n"

We had no problem making quarterly appointments for follow up visits, but about a week before the quarterly appointment the office would call and cancel the appointment and reschedule for about 2 weeks after we were to run out of meds. This happened 3 times in a little over a year. My husband was a nervous wreck over this practice.\\nWe also found it impossible to get same day appointments when acute illnesses happened. My daughter had strep throat symptoms and the office stated that they were too busy to see her. Strep throat can result in kidney problems, heart valve problems, and scarlet fever. We ended up going to an urgent care for the issue. \\nFinally, most offices will do your annual physical, send you to the lab for the required lab tests and phone you with the results. This office requires two separate doctors appointments, requiring two co-pays and additional costs for the insurance company.\n"

aS'"""\\We wanted to take you out for your last dinner...so we got to thinking \'what place has specials on a Tuesday?\'..and I remembered Chompie\'s has a special..AND A FOOD CHALLENGE.\\""""\\n\\nAnd THAT is how I ended up at Chompie\'s on a Tuesday.  They were featured on TV (I think it\'s Man Vs. Food, but I\'m not sure) bc of this food challenge of theirs.  On Tuesdays, they have a special - AYCE Jewish sliders  and  fries with the purchase of a beverage for $11.95.  (Keep in mind, a plate of 3 Jewish sliders + fries is $11.95.)\\n\\nI was told the specialties here are sliders.  The sliders themselves are a decent size (I\'d say maybe it\'s the same size as the tiny McD\'s burgers, but taller?).  Jewish sliders have potato cakes in them; Western sliders don\'t; breakfast sliders are something completely different.\\n\\nEverything we ordered was ehhhh (befitting of a \\""""meh, I\'ve experienced better\\"""" rating).  Two things that did impress me, however, were:\\n\\n1. They place pickles on the table right when you sit down!  I\'m not a pickle girl myself, but it\'s a nice gesture.\\n2. Everyone here is so FRIENDLY (I mean genuinely friendly!!).  Idk, I think most Arizonians in general are friendlier than the Californians I encounter on a daily basis hahahhaa.  And our waitress went out of her way to split 5 checks for our party of 7...that was pretty cool of her.\\n\\nI\'m glad I went here for the experience, but I wouldn\'t come back again.

aS"The food was good. The service sucked! Our server 'Ceasar' was super nice when he first came to the table. However after our entrees were delivered, that was the last time we saw him. I have never, ever....ever been somewhere that let's a beer glass go completely empty. Let alone a glass of tea, which both happened. The busser actually filled my husband's tea, and another server came and offered us boxes. Then I was finally offered a 2nd beer after I was about 97% done with my meal.\\nIt is a shame, because the menu was inventive. We would have tried other items, like we were going to order dessert, but due to the neglect we will not be returning.\n"

aS"Oh dear, this one of those fusion restaurants, they want to be authentic Mediterranean but they need to be extra certain they are catering to their demographics. If ya know what i'm sayin'.\\n\\nAnyways, this place is decent. The only issue I have is that the food is overpriced and really isn't very authentic. This fact combined with the fact that its not a lot of food for your money, aka bad value makes it lose a few points in my book.\\n\\nThe service is good, the staff is very friendly and its worth a visit, who knows you might like it? If you can't make it to Haji Baba in Tempe, or Baiz Market in Phoenix, then I suppose you can check this place out. Don't expect to be wowed too much. I pretty much never crave the food here, and the only reason it might be worth coming here is if you have a party of like 4 or more. Haji Baba and Baiz probably cannot realistically accommodate large parties.\n"

aS'"""This place needs improvements in so many areas! Our experience was very similar to some of the other reviews. We went there for breakfast on a Saturday morning. There was plenty of open tables when we got there, but we were still had to wait 10-15 minutes to get seated. The hostess explained to us that the cooks were \'catching up\' on the orders and that\'s why we had to wait. When I asked if she could just seat us and take our order 10-15 min later, she looked completely confused and said, \\uh...I...don\'t know...I was told not to seat anybody\\"""". So there was a bunch of other people just standing there, waiting, and you could see they getting frustrated by this too. \\nWe finally go seated and the waitress got our order, she was nice, but took a long time to come back after she took our drink order. We waited at least 20 minutes to get our food. When the food finally arrived, we were not impressed at all! My husband got the El Jefe Omelet, it looked soooo good on the menu, but he was very disappointed. We paid $8.50 for a below average omelet with 1 slice of toast. They charge extra for sides like home potatoes...most restaurant places we go to include the toast and potatoes with your meal, especially when you pay that much! So yeah, their prices are not the best, especially for the quality and quantity of food. I got the El Gallo Torta, and it was OK. We also paid $3 for 1 egg and a slide of toast for our son, and never got a refill on our coffee.\\nThis place has potential, I like their concept, but they need A LOT of improvement if they want to keep customers coming back. I know we won\'t be back after our disappointing experience."""""""\n'

aS"While Kai did have an interesting tasting menu featuring unique takes on native cuisine, I was disappointed overall. They had recently increased the price of their tasting menus far above what was advertised on the website (which I've noticed has since been corrected). At the their new prices -- $280 for the large tasting menu with wine -- it wasn't even close to worth it. Atlas Bistro or Quiessence were as good or better, and now, after trying Kai, seem like a bargain. \\n\\nIf Kai were to offer their tasting menu at a price point closer to that of Atlas or Quiessence, I would definitely recommend them and would not hesitate to offer a four-star rating. The ambiance at Kai, similar to that of an off-strip 1970s era Vegas hotel, was marginally better than Atlas, but inferior to Quiessence. While the food at Kai was interesting, it just wasn't phenomenal enough to merit the outrageous cash outlay necessary to try it -- more than double other locally foced, chef-driven Valley restaurants.\\n\\nIf you're in the market for a nice, creative dinner, I'd rather recommend restaurants such as Quiessence, Atlas Bistro, FnB or Binkley's, all of which offer at least as good of an experience without requiring multiple wheelbarrows of cash to partake in phenomenally interesting and creative cuisine.\n"

Last night I ordered wings from their Wing Street and they were actually edible, but the little dumbass delivery guy named Pedro didn't say a word the entire time he was standing at my door. I have to assume you know how to speak, as I'm sure even Pizza Hut has that requirement. Maybe he got lost in the bird poo forest on the way to my house and was scared off by the hazardous waste sign at my front door, or the fact that I answered the door with a gun on my hip.

That aside the brown crust was flaking off of the plain roll, like old bread does.  The roll had already started coming apart before I could pick it up.  Need less to say it quickly didintegrated as soon as I bit in.  The pickle was limp and broken.  This a small place that could do a good lunch business I suspect if quality was better.

aS"I had the damndest time trying to find this place! I was supposed to go a couple weeks ago and got so frustrated I turned my car around and hung out in Tempe instead. Tonight-I was bloody determined to find it. Still got turned around, but finally-hidden behind a bunch of trees and connected some kind of sporting event sales place, there was the Willow House-damn!\\n\\nBeautiful stones laid out on the grass, a kind of bubbling brook (man-made) and a lot of picnic tables on the corner of McDowell and 2nd Ave, let to stairs to the actual Willow House. There were tons of options on the board but no prices (?) and the pastries, as noted, did not look that appealing. The barista I thought was pleasant and made small talk and a small chai soy latte. It came to a whopping $4.09 (!) which I was pretty surprised by, but coughed up the cash. It was actually a mix and way too sweet for me, but he did steam the soy for me pretty well.\\n\\nWith Soy Chai in hand, I wandered around. It is narrow at first and there all these Mexican and day of the dead kind of knick-knacks and random merchandise displayed. There is a little nook, must have been a closet, with some random vintage clothing reasonably priced and handsomely displayed there. I noted to my right was a Non-Smoking room with some people intent on laptops and older couples chatting-seemed pleasant and actually a little quiet (couldn't tell if it was a 'weird' quiet or a nice zen like quiet). I wandered more (this place is deceptively large) and ended up in a large open room with chairs and large tables where people could smoke. It opened out to a glass-enclosed narrow front room (that faced McDowell) with a high counter and some two seater and four seater tables. There were guys chatting and talking about chainsaws (I was reminded somewhat eerily of Linklater's movie Slacker). I moved away from that odd little conversation to a room with cheap LPs, some awesome 2 buck cassette tapes (Best of Bill Cosby, Guns n Roses, Heart-what!), an odd little table and interesting but somewhat amatuerish art on the walls. Unfortunately this also let me peer into a small backroom/dark kitchen (!?) with a dude making a sandwich...with his barehands. It was kind of creepy. Dream-like, really. I quickly walked away from that observation and noted never to get a sandwich here. I stumbled upon some more nooks and crannies displaying totebags and glass jewelrey before stepping out and resting at one of their picnic tables and watching the traffic on McDowell.\\n\\nEh.\n"

Both orders of meatloaf looked very dry even with the gravy on top, the side of gravy didn\'t come out with meal, the mac and cheese was runny like it wasn\'t cooked enough or hastily thrown together. The burger was looking good but if one piece of cheese is extra cheese....... When we asked for our side of gravy and my friends husband asked about the extra cheese....

The meatloaf was mediocre at best and the gravy a congealed mess and salty along with our alleged \\""""fresh cut\\"""" fries.... The mac and cheese was not good at all according to my friend but her husband said the burger was good and the pickle that came with it was nice and crunchy.

aS"I don't like to give places a 1 star review unless I have either gotten sick or had a really bad experience. I sort of had a combination of the two at China Magic Noodle House. I saw a groupon for this restaurant a couple days ago and it looked simple and good so I went ahead and bought it. I am always in the mood for noodles so I was excited to try this place, and it was right down the street from my house. So Sunday afternoon we decided to eat here for lunch. I have been sitting on this experience for two days now and I feel that I am not giving a harsh review based on my experience. \\n\\nWe walk in around 3pm and there were only a few tables being served. The first thing that hits me is the smell of this place. My first thought was that it smelled like urine. I'm sure it was just a combination of the spices and whatever was being made in the kitchen, but it was not a mouth watering smell like you should experience when you walk into a restaurant. I should have turned right around and went home, but we stayed. So we sit down and someone brings over some water and some boiled peanuts and pickled vegetables. I still am not sure if this was supposed to be some kind of appetizer or a garnish for the noodles. It was a little weird. So I decided on the spicy vegetarian noodle dish, and my husband decides on the vegetables and fried noodle dish and a strawberry smoothie. I see that there are spring rolls on the menu as well. There is a language barrier here with the waiters so when I asked if the spring rolls were vegetarian at first she just thought I was ordering them, but after asking three times whether or not they were vegetarian I think she finally understood what I was asking. So I was a little bit concerned about these. \\n\\nEverything came out really fast. Like around 5 minutes fast. The spring rolls were vegetarian, but they tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. And the vegetables inside were really limp and not crisp at all. A couple packets of mustard and some gelatin like duck sauce come with the rolls. I didn't use either. How hard would it be to make a really simple nice sauce for the rolls? My noodles come out first and at first they look really good and I was excited. However as I am eating them I am noticing some weird textures in the supposedly vegetarian sauce. It tasted almost like some kind of seafood and it was gritty. I didn't finish it and when I asked two different waitresses what was in the sauce, neither of them could tell me. Which is concerning. I can't feel good going back to a place that can't tell me whats in the vegetarian sauce. My husband liked his noodles, but he isn't as paranoid about what his food is made out of as I am. His smoothie tasted like a slushie you get at 7-11. I am sure it was made with some kind of red dye and not fresh strawberries. Sickeningly sweet as well. \\n\\nAbout an hour later we are walking around Target and my stomach starts to burn. I feel this intense burning sensation in my stomach for the next two days. I think there is some kind of issue with MSG here possibly. I don't know what else could have made me feel like that. I also didn't eat pretty much anything for the next two days because of how bad my stomach felt. \\n\\nThe only cool thing about this place is the guy who pulls noodles in the big window in the middle of the restaurant.

aS'"""I will say that word \\grocery\\"""" is a tad misleading.  There is food to buy, but it\'s limited selection is like a cross between an expensive 7-11 and what you would find in Mario Batali\'s Food Network kitchen.  Plus, no one could ever need that much pasta, olive oil  and  balsamic vinegar, especially at that price.  I digress though...\\n\\nMy main issue was with their \\""""lunch\\"""" offerings.  I had an artisan pizza, and my friend a salad.  My friend self-described her salad as \\""""eh...ok\\"""".  My pizza was not only grossly overpriced, but it the worst pizza I\'ve ever had.  The toppings were sparse, and didn\'t seem that high in quality.  Plus, it was so greasy.\\n\\nFor as long as I can remember, I have unmercifully made fun of people who blot their pizza with napkins to take grease off, but I confess I had to do it today.  The box was almost soaked thru before I even got, so you can only imagine how much was pooled on top.  It was barely edible.\\n\\nAfter I got back to work  and  looked at their website, they barely seem loosely affiliated with the original Oakville Grocery in Napa.  This location isn\'t even listed on the real Oakville Grocery website... \\n\\nIn the end, you can find the same products elsewhere  and  the food here is nothing to write home about, so save yourself the trouble."""""""\n'

aS'"""I hired EcoFresh to clean 2 rugs and my formal living room couch and loveseat after our move.\\n\\nUnfortunately I didn\'t have a good experience with them and the end result is 3 cushions on the couch and loveseat are ruined. \\nI called Ecofresh the day after they came to do the cleaning of my belongings to inform them that I had noticed some spots on my couch/loveseat after they cleaned and it looked like the fabric had been bleached. They sent one of their technicians out a few days later to redo the bleached areas and I ended up with blue stained cushions. I called them again to inform them of the blue stains that were now on my cushions and again they sent their same technician out again to redo the same cushions for the 3rd time. I ended up with \'bleached stained\' looking cushions again. \\n\\nI continued my communication after 4 weeks in regards to the damaged cushions (4th call) with Ecofresh and they asked if they could come pick up the cushions and examine them at their shop.\\nAfter a week without my cushions, I had to call and follow-up with Ecofresh to see what the outcome was after they took my cushions to their shop to examine and asked if I could pick them up from them, but then I was informed that they were at a different business unrelated to Ecofresh in downtown Phoenix, at \'McFarland Carpet Service\'. They sent my cushions to a different business owner and he had nothing to do with my cushions.\\n\\n At this point I spoke with Phillip (the owner of Ecofresh) and he seemed unremorseful about this whole situation and mishap.   I informed Phillip of having a few upholstery professionals examine the spots on my couch and he indicated to me that they needed an \'ICR certification\' and if they didn\'t have this certification that their opinion didn\'t matter or qualify.\\n\\nAfter picking up my cushions and finding out that McFarland Carpet service was NOT ICR certified and was not sure why Ecofresh brought my cushions to him, Phillip proceed to call me back and say that he was sorry and he would be refunding me my money for the cleaning service. Phillip then indicated to me that he was going to get an \'ICR certified\' person for upholstery to come examine my cushions so we could find out why this happened.  I was please of this news.\\n\\nPhillip had Oscar from Bailey\'s furniture come out examine my couch. When I called Oscar to coordinate a time for him to come he indicated that he did business with Ecofresh and he was NOT \\ICR\\"""" certified. Oscar came out and examined my couches and indicated to me that they used the wrong product on my couches and he would let Ecofresh know the damage they had done, since they supposedly hired him to look at my furniture.\\n\\nAt this point it has been about 5 weeks since I began the whole process with Ecofrech. They said they were going to refund me (last week) the charges for the services and in the case the damage was their fault they would pay for it. I have not seen a check for the refund for the services and no resolution on my damaged couches.\\n\\n From the 2 individuals as well as Oscar from \\""""Baileys Furniture\\"""" (that Ecofresh hired) there is about $ 4,000 worth of damage.\\n\\nI would NOT recommend EcoFresh and I wish them the best of luck in their business if this is how they treat their customers."""""""\n'

aS'"""We decided to eat here for our 4th anniversary dinner.  Let\'s start with the positives.  Beautiful decor, love the contemporary feel with the chalk blackboard  wall. Great location, the Camelback Inn is very beautiful.  The meal began with the chef\'s gift of  warm chicken liver spread with thyme and crusty bread - wonderfu,l followed by  the gruyere glazed popover served with a ramekin of european butter and sea salt.-amazing!  A little recipe card is included with the popovers-nice touch.   I wish I had more positives to say I really wanted to love this restaurant.\\n\\nSo now for the reasons for the 2 star rating.   \\nWhen we arrived for our reservation, it would have been nice to have heard happy anniversary since we had noted that on our open table reservation.We were  seated in a great round booth nice intimate location for our anniversary dinner. When we arrived at our booth she  pulled the table out so we could snuggle in the back and on the seat was food.  Thankfully she noticed and I thought she would apologize and promptly clean up. What happened next should have been a warning sign of how our night was going to turn out.  She said, \\Oh\\"""" and stood there, so I said \\""""here I\'ll move so you can clean that off.  She then proceeded to enter the booth and swipe the food off the seat onto the floor with her hand.  Not what I\'d expect of a Laurent Tourondel restaurant. Our server arrived  promptly but still no happy anniversary.  I don\'t mean to make a big deal out of the lack of a greeting, it\'s just  a nice touch when celebrating a special occasion, definitely not a reason to give a 2 star rating though , so I\'ll continue.   We ordered our wine and to our surprise our server returned promptly and to our relief wished us Happy Anniversary, which quickly turned awkward as he tried to connect with us and tell us all of his friends are starting to marry and have children and now his girlfriend is looking at him wondering what his problem is that he hasn\'t asked her to marry him yet and how wow thats a lot of responsibility and he didn\'t know how people could get married blah blah blah. Thanks, you could\'ve kept your happy anniversary.  Awkward and uncomfortable!  He then proceeded to tell us that the wine we ordered was not chilled enough and would we mind if he chilled it for 6-10 minutes.  Really, how could the wine not be chilled if it\'s on the menu.  Still ok at this point, we aren\'t high maintenace diners and honestly pretty easy going and very forgiving.  We thought at this point he would take our orders, however even though we were only 1 or 3 tables filled in the restaurant he did not return to take our order until our wine was chilled.  What he did do was help the table next to ours get that perfect photo for their memory album and blind us with the flash of their camera several times cause they weren\'t quite happy with their photo.  To his credit he did apologize when he returned to take our order.  \\n\\nI ordered the spice rubbed cowboy ribeye, my husband the bone in rib eye, a side of the creamed spinach, jalapeno mash, and hen of the woods mushrooms with a side of chimichuri and green peppercorn sauce.   The cowboy ribeye comes to the table with the whole rib attached to the ribeye not expecting that. The spices were so charred the only flavor I got was burnt and the meat itself was so fatty half the steak was totally inedible. My husband kindly shared his steak which was good, but hardly anything I would return for.  Great hen of the woods mushrooms really enjoyed these  favorite part of the dinner.  The rest of the sides ok nothing great though.  \\nWe finished and my husband had to refill his own wine glass, because our server was chatting and taking pictures again. \\n\\n What happened next was truly shocking, something I\'d expect if we were at Mcdonalds  but not a upscale steakhouse.  An electrician showed up and proceeded to change the light bulb that was out at the booth next to ours.  Mind you by this time it was 10:30 pm and the restaurant closed at 11pm.  Really are you freaking kidding me you can\'t wait a half hour to change a light bulb.  \\n\\nTo BLT\'S credit they arrived  with a complimentary dessert, however as the wait staff, not our server sets it down in front of us and promptly walks away without explaining what it was we looked down and in fittingly comic horror scribbled on the plate is Happy Birthday!  WOW!!\\nOur server shows to drop off the check and looks at the plate and says\\"""" did they write happy birthday?  haha that\'s funny\\""""\\n\\nReally BLT!  We trusted the reputation of Laurent Tourondel to schedule our special occasion and this was very amateur and embarrassing for your restaurant  at best.  When you go out to dinner and willing fork out over $200 for a meal this is not what is expected.  \\nI guess my husband and I should thank BLT for giving us such a  great story to tell all of our friends and family of the night we wasted over $200 on a comical night of amateur proportion."""""""\n'

aS"Dropped in here relatively late on a Saturday evening for a fast dinner for five, but it turned out to be nearly an all-night ordeal.  The service was just awful, what with an inexperienced waiter and staffing that did not match the number of people on a Saturday night.  Our order was simple- burgers, etc., but it took nearly a half hour to be served.  The restaurant is relatively large but only one small area was open to guests and that made it very loud and gave a crowded feeling to dinner.  When we did get our order, there was little or no  follow-up with more coffee, etc.  The evening was full of apologies and reassurances.  It may have been a fluke, but that evening, the place was not even up to  the moderate service standard at most Coco's.  The coconut custard pie was excellent, though, when it finally arrived.  I'd give them another try, I suppose, but there are lots of other places in Phoenix.\n"

I personally try to avoid flying in general because big crowds, undetermined schedules, and confined spaces just scream potential chaos situation, but I definitely avoid US Airways because, as a member of the non-VIP crowd, I've always experienced horrible customer service.  It is common, in the travel sector, to deal with delays and schedule changes due to weather or other issues, however, it's completely unnecessary to remind me, by your tone of voice, that I do not provide the company with enough cashflow/year to be considered important.\\n\\nUnless you fly first-class on a weekly basis, you won't get much customer service from them.\n"

We have gone back many times and I must admit that it has gotten worse  and  worse every time. The food selection has gotten worse  and  the price higher. We also saw them on the dirty dinning report  and  they got a horrible rating and neither of us was surprised. It's sad, such a great Idea  and  good location could have done allot better!\n"

aS"I could not agree more with Alicia B's review. I went here with my husband Saturday night, it is in our nieghboorhood and we had heard decent things. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, not because it was full or busy. The hostess looked a right at us, no acknowledgement and then she went on to what must have been more important business. Finally, a passing waiter sat us. The service continued to be inattentive and slow. Our cocktails were tasty, I had a pomegranire margarita and my husband has something with a kooky name, I think it mentioned a Donkey. We had the Queso with crab which was pretty good, the crab could have been tastier and the whole thing needed some spice. The chips and salsa, OK. I had the carnitas, after recommendation by our waitress. Not bad, but certainly not good and not worth $17. My Husband has the seafood crepes, they were OK, but lacking flavor. The food was not bland, but flat, just meh. This place would be a 3 star, but for the price, it is coming down to a 2 star. \\nThe building and patio are really cool and set a good atmosphere, too bad the food and service don't follow suit. \\n\\nOn a side note I did get to overhear a great conversation by two guys visiting from out of town, probably in thier mid to late 40s. I guess last time they came here the women were way hotter. This time there are hot women, but they are not as common. They seemed to like the place, one of them remarked the only thing better than his food was getting laid earlier that day.\n"

We drove from San Diego so we were too tired to complain.  The second night it got worse, so we did complain and they moved us to another room where they used industrial strength Febreze to cover the dirty smell of the room and it smelled like a cheap men\'s cologne - drenched on everything. So, after a sneezing attack and asthma onset, we moved to another room that was ten times worse.  If you have any allergies, ask them not to spray this chemical in your room.  Finally, after sitting in the lobby with all our luggage for an hour they gave us a \\clean\\"""" room without all the chemicals.  But, the bathroom was lacking one important amenity, no light fixtures above the sink.  Only a heat lamp over the toilet.

Kudos for that.\\n\\nThe food. Wow, lets talk about that. My house salad was fine, better than most pizza places that usually just give you hunks of iceberg and quartered tomatoes like they couldn't care less. My salad had baby reds, arugula, and fresh romaine. Extra points for that. The pizza, however... what happened there? The first thing we immediately noticed was that the sauce on our standard cheese pizza was extremely watery and flavorless. I have never experienced sauce so watery and it made the entire pizza a soupy mess. Despite this, we were really hungry, so I said screw it and had a slice. I wish I hadn't, because now my stomach is paying for it as we speak. \\n\\nI was also disappointed that the spinach that I asked for on our pizza was nothing like the spinach that I'm used to enjoying on top of their white pizza. Instead we received whole leaves of spinach that were toasted to an unenjoyable, also flavorless crisp. \\n\\nTo be fair, I realize that when it comes to chain restaurants some locations are better than others, and I also realize that this one just recently opened. Still, I just can't excuse a pizza (and not a very cheap one at that) that could be so bad.

aS'"""A warm greeting means alot, but if that\'s the best part of one\'s take out experience, the establishment probably doesnt warrant four or five stars.  Portions are solid and prices fair, but there are a number of things Karey\'s could improve on. \\n\\nFirst, the signature dishes we tried didnt have much wow factor at all.   The cute little lumpia are like Sharon Stone in \'Basic Instinct\'. Blonde and delicious on the outside, dark and horrible within. The pork paste, or whatever it is, might as well be dog food. Sorry, but that\'s my honest opinion.  The authentic, custardy cassava cake was different (yay!) and cheap(yay!), but quite mild for a dessert, at least to my undiscerning, sugar-addled taste.   \\n\\nOur chicken sample was dry, the pork adobo and beef offered were better - the texture of the slow cooked beef reminded me of my mother\'s Yankee pot roast - only this had less flavor and seasoning.  My unadventerous teen said his beef burrito was one of the worst meals he\'s had in a while...not much juicy meat taste and a ridiculous amount of cheese which overpowered everything.  \\n\\nSecond, the free samples are fun and appreciated but the context in which they\'re provided is a little awkward.  When we walked in, all the steamtrays were covered and there were no pictures of the food - at least not that I remember. Maybe there\'s a culinary reason for the covers, but you cant SEE or really SMELL any food!  So you\'re kind of at Karen\'s \\mercy\\"""" to provide you with these toothpick samples.  She cheerfully offered three mainstays (chicken, beef, pork)...and then there was this sort of lull, where I guess we were supposed to \\""""decide\\"""", despite a blackboard off to the side, listing four or five addtl specialties.   \\n\\nIt\'s partly my fault. I asked about pancit and dropped a hint or two that I wanted to try a variety, but couldve been more forceful probing options.  By this time, however, we had already eaten six skewers and I felt a little piggish asking for more. And Karen didnt offer more. Were we hard sold something we didnt want? No.  But I felt gently steered toward a few standard selections and away from other (more exotic?) options, especially considering there was nobody behind us in line.  If the covers were off, or there were pictures, I\'d have been more likely to say, \\""""That looks interesting\\"""" or \\""""that smells good, what\'s that?\\"""".   In lieu of a detailed, descriptive menu (there is none, although Karen was verbally descriptive and very helpful) I just think a customer benefits most from a visual display (think Miracle Mile Deli, Panda Express, etc) of ready to eat fare.     \\n\\nWe stopped by around 5:30pm on a Thursday, and were at Karey\'s around  fifteen minutes.  There were no other customers.  Zero.  Tons of traffic driving home from work. And nobody.   At this point, I think Karey\'s is a more sincere than genuinely  savvy operation, but that could change by smoothing a few rough edges,  showcasing all their recipes and maybe a spicier sauce or two.  \\n\\nTwo minor glitches.  We werent given a receipt copy for our take out order. Also, one of our plastic clamshells leaked on the way home.   The sauce was filled near the brim, but it was messy and annoying.  Good intentions...not so good execution.    \\n\\nThere\'s definitely potential here and they\'re not too far from making this a terrific place with broad appeal.  Who wouldnt root for a relatively unfamiliar cuisine served up by such friendly folks?   But I think (for well intentioned Yelpers) to pretend they\'ve already nailed it, largely on the strength of warm greetings and surprisingly mild fare with exotic names, may be setting Karey\'s up for a wave of unmet expectations.

aS"The ONLY reason to go here is for the chefs who cook at your table (if you sit at the right tables).  The chefs are entertaining and put on a good show.   However, everything else here SUCKS.  The building is a strange slanted roof/huge ceiling building that looks like it used to be a church or ski lodge or something.  The service is bad and even thought he chefs are good, the food is mediocre.  The worst part of this place by far though is that there is no air coniditioning!!! It's hot as hell in this place.

aS'"""My wife and I met there for lunch. We started with an order of fried pickles which were horrible. The batter was grainy like it consisted only of cornmeal. We each ordered fish tacos which arrived luke warm. Our waiter was running all over the place and seemed really behind...this would explain why our food arrived late. The fish was heavily battered and heavily deep fried.....like a big, greasy sponge. I know some of you are thinking \\why did this guy go to a wings place and get fish tacos\\"""". Well folks, once I got a look at their wings I decided the fish tacos were probably a safer bet. I make delicious fish tacos at home and figured they couldn\'t screw them up.

aS'"""Read the reviews on Yelp tonite and decided to give Arriba\'s a whirl.  We went to the Camelback location.  The place was OK.  Nothing stupendous and nothing God awful either.  The whole place looked pretty grungy, in particular there was trash all over the floors; bits of paper, wrappers, gum and such. \\n\\nThe service was \\meh\\"""".  After we were seated a highly disinterested bus person or food runner dropped off a heaping wrought iron edifice of greasy, pretty tasteless chips.  They actually tasted more like cereal than tortilla chips. She also sloughed off extra ramekins of bland, but spicy bean dip and salsa.  She kinda dropped the stuff on the table and withdrew quickly as if she were throwing a diaper into the trash.  Our server barely spoke English and barely seemed to notice we were there.  She seemed either aloof or afraid to speak, which I guess was her personal rendition of subservience or something.\\n\\nThe BF and I both wanted to try the White Sands Chimi after all the awesome reviews on Yelp, so we agreed that he\'d get it, give me a bite and I ordered the Arriba sampler, which was like 8 appetizer sized chucks of really greazy, indistinguishable and pretty tasteless finger foods.  He ordered guacamole with his and I asked for sour creme with mine.  His guacamole did not come out on his plate or on the side, but we were charged $2.50 for it.  I did get \\""""sour creme\\"""" but it was more of a frozen glop of dairy than anything else.  The White Sands Chimi seemed like it would have a good flavor but I couldn\'t really savor it because the intense burning was too much to endure. The BF  and  I literally swapped plates halfway thru the meal b/c he couldn\'t take the heat of the chilies anymore.  I really don\'t think they\'re hatch chilies. They burned like jalape\\u00f1o.  I buy roasted hatch chilies fresh-roasted at Food City all the time and they do not burn the crap outta your tongue like this food did.\\n\\nOur server never came back to check on the food, our drinks, bring more water or soda and I literally had to flag her down to ask for the check.  It was NOT busy in there at all and I saw about 5 other servers buzzing about serving the maybe 10 tables total that were seated in the whole place.\\n\\nAll in all -- nothing overwhelming, including the food. It just all tasted like overly greazy fried corn chips that had been in a half empty cereal box for 6 months.  Other than \\""""spicy\\"""" -- there were no particularly memorable or enjoyable flavors.  I don\'t think that just burning my (I suppose wuss-assed, from other people\'s reviews) tongue on bland fried foods is authentic Mexican.\\n\\nThere were some people hootin\' it up in the bar. I guess if you like Big Gulp-sized margaritas, this place might be cool. Doubt I\'ll return.  The BF liked it though, so who knows. Maybe it was just an off night for me.

aS'"""I need to preface this review with one statement. \\n\\nI used to love the food. I used to be a regular here and told just about anyone that would listen how good it was.\\n\\nHere is the bad. I was eating lunch here one day and broke a tooth on a bone or large piece gristle. I was not just a chipped tooth, but an actual break. I informed Dan Maldonado, the owner, before I left. He was seemed genuinely concerned and cooperative.  I went directly to the dentist and was informed it would need  a crown.  A few days later I went to Tacos Atoyac to discuss this with Dan . He was the exact opposite and informed me that his cousin was a lawyer (big deal) and that it was up to me to prove it happened there. Well, I gave Dan the benefit of the doubt and let him know I was not there to shake him down. Really, all I wanted was an apology and a little help with the dental costs, which amounted to over $1,000. I left my card and waited a couple of weeks for a call.\\n I never expected him to cover all of it, or even half of it. I was looking for a little acknowledgement.  I never got it. I stopped by a couple of times and Dan was either \\not there\\"""" or too busy to talk. I expected more courtesy. To his credit, he offered to buy my burrito the last time I was there. Unfortunately,  it was was weak attempt to make amends. I did not accept, because this was never about money. \\n\\nAs far as the food, make your own choice, but be careful. It could cost you more than $4.00 and the owner could care less about the repercussions to his customers."""""""\n'

The Big Hamburger that was ordered medium by one person in my party came well done and dry as the desert. The initial helping of all you can eat beef ribs was pretty good...if a little too saucy...with the meat falling off the bone. but the additional helpings were AWFUL!!! TERRIBLY under cooked and had to order 2 additional helpings just to get 3 bites of edible meat...the second helping didn't even appear to have been cooked and I had to fight to get 3 bites off of EIGHT Ribs....Just Awful.\\n\\nThe Outback, Texas Roadhouse and Saltgrass Steakhouse are less expensive and provide much better fare. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is country western with a band that plays occasionally and virtually all the staff we dealt with were friendly and accommodating.

aS'"""I don\'t know if this place has gone downhill since the last reviews or if the people involved are used to lack luster \\authentic\\"""" Mexican food. Party of two last night, just me and the wife yet it took the staff at least 10 minutes to set our table with menus and ask us about our drink of choice. (- 1 star) I ordered a #12 (Red chili burro, taco, R  and  B) and my wife ordered the Carne Asada plate. The food prep took 40 minutes to get to our table (-1 star), and the only exciting thing was watching the tables next to us get food in 15 minute intervals and by the time one table is finished eating the next received their food. My red chili burro had tough meat and the sauce was clearly out of a can and the wifes Carne Asade was far from par it was a tough double bogey. (-1 star) The place was packed so I gave them some slack but when the waitress says they are out of ice while another is putting ice in a pitcher that\'s where I draw the line. Horrible service from the majority of servers, with only one working hard (-1 star). Nothing like waiting 10 minutes for a refill or more chips, and the whole dinner for two was nearly 1.5 hours long for a hole in the wall cafe. I normally gives places a second shot, but it\'s a slap in the face to a real good authentic place in other parts of the valley I.E. Pedro\'s in Glendale, or Rita\'s off 43rd ave and the I-10.

aS"The food here was decent, but nothing to write home about. The tortilla soup had a nice spicy kick. The ahi tuna appetizer was pretty good, I had that as my main dish. My fellow diners were also satisfied with their orders. The one dish I didn't think was very good was the green chili mac and cheese side. It tasted like velveeta instant mac  and  cheese with a little green chili added.  If I was only rating the food, this place would probably get 3 stars but I had some issues with the service and ambience.\\n\\nOur party was seated towards the back of the restaurant near a back door, which servers used to go in and out to get more chairs. This happened at least 3 times during our meal, which was an issue since the temp was down to about 50 degrees that night.

aS'"""First of all, please forgive. I have been AWOL for the past...months!!! So many changes in my life have happened--mainly the \\career\\"""" aspect of it--that I haven\'t had the chance to catch up with the \\""""social\\"""" aspect. \\n\\nOkay, I jest...I\'ve been going to happy hours left and right that I haven\'t had time to even write a single review for the past few months. Hey, at least I know that the first step is acknowledgement that I have a slight problem.\\n\\nAnyway, I work in downtown Phoenix now...and let me start off my new batch of reviews with the NASTY.\\n\\nHere it is in a nutshell...101 Bistro is a waste of precious, precious real estate! From what I\'ve heard, this restaurant has re-incarnated itself a few times, and each time, the owners can\'t seem to get it right. \\n\\nIt was lunch time and this sheltered suburbanite decided to step into what seemed like a very cool place from the outside. 101 Bistro has a corner, sidewalk patio where you know want to be seen with your patent leather high-heeled shoes, your Chloe Paddington bag (the fake one, of course), and maybe your pouffy, yappy dog, while sipping tea and munching on the most decadent chocolatey cheesecake. Well, I didn\'t possess any of those that day, so I opted for a table inside where the lunch atmosphere was the typical \\""""blue-tied gentlemen and women in ubiquitous polyester suits (not that there\'s anything wrong with polyester)\\"""" all intently examining the mysterious brown leather-bound portfolio, acting as if they have some top secret shit in their hands. You know the kinds.\\n\\nAnyway, my lonely self found a corner table and began looking at their lunch menu that is supposed to be served fast enough to get you back in the office on time. I decided on the gyro--with slices of meat, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, onion and then drizzled with a Mediterranean yogurt sauce wrapped in a fresh, warm pita bread (is that what you call the bread?). Oh it was served super fast alright, too fast that the warm pita bread was not at all warm and the thin slices of meat could use a little more nuking (oh please don\'t tell me that they only grill their meats...if you have to serve it quick, I\'m sure you nuke it). The meat also needed more seasonings (Mediterranean seasonings preferably). Ooooh, and that yogurt sauce drizzled over it? Water-y and bland.\\n\\nSo, my lonely self was forced to never let go of the pepper shaker throughout my dining experience and peppered that crap out of that gyro just to give my taste buds some kind of sensation and pleasure. Then I had a thought! Maybe...just maybe...I should order some kind of dessert to make my lonely self feel all better deep inside. But alas, I looked at their refrigerated display case where their desserts are housed, and sad to report, I couldn\'t really see inside because of the major condensation on the glass! Their frickin refrigerated display case was not working up to par; there was a pool of water on the floor (meaning: the ice is melting); and there are rounds and rounds of cheesecake and other dairy-filled goodies in there waiting to be saved!!! IN THE SUMMER HEAT!!! Uhhh...I don\'t know about you but, improperly refrigerated dairy desserts in the Arizona heat is a no-no to me.\\nSadness filled my heart for 101 Bistro. It has the potential to become the hip happening lunch place to be seen, especially when the light rail is up and running. \\n\\nBut hey, the service was fast...so fast that they forgot to give me my iced tea (until I realized that I was choking on the bland gyro) and my eating utensils (until I realized that I needed a fork and a napkin to wipe off the watery yogurt sauce dribbling down my chin). \\n\\nSad!"""""""\n'

And every other time I've gone here, it's been bland bland bland food. Nothing pops at this restaurant when it comes to the food. And the drinks...blah at best. I once ordered a Waborita and had to send it back three because it was so watered down. You'd have to spend a lot of money to get a buzz on at this place because the drinks are very watered down. The beers are crisp and fresh, but the drinks..not so much. \\n\\nNow if you are looking for ATMOSPHERE, Cooperstown is your place.  The staff all have the Alice Cooper-esque eye-liner which is cool. There is Alice memoribilia covering every inch of every wall in the place. And of course all good theme restaurants have a gift shop.  They have great live bands that come out to play and when there is no band, they have great piped in music too.  \\n\\nCooperstown is a novel place to take out-of-town guests before a game, but if it's just you and your family, you won't feel empty if you skip it.

aS'"""My boyfriend and I were on a date. We had made plans to go watch a move at the iPic for the first time. Being it Scottsdale and a nice area, we decided to have dinner at Tanzy first, (yuck), and then decided to give Salt a try since we were early for the movie. We sat in the lounge area. We were greeted by some guy, no name, nothing, just gave us a menu. And then asked us what we wanted for drinks. We decided since our cocktails at Tanzy were gross, we thought it might be better at Salt. Um no, their cocktails/specialty drinks were just as gross. I ordered the Arizona Rita, so gross! it didn\'t taste like any alcohol in it. It tasted really sour fruit puree! My boyfriend had a bad experience with the cocktails at Tanzy before we went to Salt so he just ordered a kilt lifter. We finally got our bill, paid and left it on the table, then headed to the movie! As were were handing our tickets over to the ticket guy at iPic, a black guy who was the bartender came running towards us and told us we had to go up to the bar and pay for our drinks. I was really caught off guard and got a little confused and angry because we had left the money with the bill at the table that we were sitting at.  We told him we had already paid and the money was on the table. My boyfriend and I got very angry with what just happened but didn\'t retaliate. We thought he was very rude to come running at us and yelling at us saying we had to go to the bar and pay our tab. The black bartender told us \\Hey you guys need to go to the bar and pay your tab.\\"""" How rude!!? He didn\'t even check the table to see we had already paid the tab, he just assumed that we were running out on the tab and came chasing after us. Before he accuses us of not paying, he should have checked the table to see we had paid, and we even left a generous tip. That bartender was very rude! I\'m pretty sure if someone was going to walk out on their tab, theyd probbaly be running and heading straight for the exit. We were just about to walk into iPic and enjoy a movie date together. Service at salt sucks! They need to hire nice bartenders and servers who know how to provide good customer service and not bartenders who are rude and accuse guests of walking out on their tab. \\n\\nI\'m very disappointed in this place, service and bartenders are rude!"""""""\n'

I had the Dosai with potatos, onions, chutney, peas and spices and loved it. I love tamarind sauce and I think the staff was please I did cause they give me a shitload. He ordered a kind of dosai with cheese in it and it tasted yummy..but eerily like an enchilda.

I understand it's an hour long flight, but even Southwest serves snacks and beverages on flights that long (and your first TWO bags are FREE).  Very unimpressive experience.  Boarding and stowing would be so much less an issue if you didn't charge for EVERY bag.  People might check theirs.  The only thing that got this two stars instead of one, was that we didn't fall out of the sky and I will hand it to the pilot on the return flight, as we flew through a gusty wind storm and though very choppy, he landed us very well.\n"

I had to call him and track down my proof, when I finally did receive the proof it was a mess. At this point I should have found another place to get my wedding invites, but I wanted to give them another chance. I responded with the changes I would like to make and told him that at this point I NEEDED them to be done in a week and a half, well what do you know...no response!

For birthdays, we do a fancy dinner  and  a family dinner. This was a family dinner. Lots of thought goes into choosing the place for each occasion. This was also my wife\'s birthday. Kind of a big deal for me. \\n\\nFor family dinner, we all go so we need a place that isn\'t too hard on the budget  and  that suits different dietary needs (some vegetarians, some food allergies). Looked at a ton of places  and  figured that we should try Tapino as they had a great food/drink special  and  we were into what they are doing. Figured it would be a gateway meal to us coming back a great deal more. \\n\\nOk, very last thing, kids... So we brought our kids. We\'ve brought our kids out to eat since they were born  and  they know  and  appreciate good food. They\'ve been places like Sea Saw, Nobu, Bouchon, etc. They know how to behave  and  are always expected to behave.\\n\\nSo to the story...\\n\\nCalled Tapino yesterday  and  spoke to the manager  and  asked if they could take a party of 12 for happy hour. She said they normally don\'t take reservations for happy hour but would be ready for us. Asked if they had 2 high chairs for the kids. She said no but they had low chairs  and  low tables on the patio that would work great. So we\'re in good shape, right?\\n\\nWell today, I walk in myself (without kids)  and  say that we are here for the party of 12 w/kids. The hostess said no kids allowed in bar nor on patio (as they allow smoking on the patio)  and  they don\'t serve happy hour in the restaurant  and  just lets it sit at that. Pretty weird. Was almost as if they\'d were ready for us. \\n\\nOk, so if you don\'t want kids in your place...at least tell us. I dragged 12 people out  and  set their expectations  and  was excited to have the perfect place to celebrate my wife\'s birthday. Then we get there  and  you say sorry, nope?\\n\\nAlso, there wasn\'t a single person in the restaurant at this time. It was about 5:45. Not one.\\n\\nI\'m like in shock so I tell her I spoke with someone yesterday  and  she understood our situation  and  that we were coming in. She said that she was right there when I spoke with her manager  and  they don\'t allow kids in the bar or on the patio  and  they don\'t do happy hour in the resturant. Ok, I get it. Probably heard this 7 times when I was there.\\n\\nMight as well have said go away, leave, we don\'t want you here.\\n\\nShe eventually said that the manager was there  and  she\'d have her come talk with me.\\n\\nDuring the wait, I asked about last night\'s locavore dinner  and  told her we were excited to be there as we\'d been following them on Chowhound  and  the Phoenix Hound Gathering group. Also told her I\'d been talking with one of the farmers that was in for the previous night\'s event. Basically I let her know we know what they did  and  were into it. Might have factored in a bit? Nope.\\n\\nEventually, the manager came out  and  they chatted.\\n\\nThe manager then came over  and  changed the story  and  said we could sit in the bar at a couple of benches but kept reiterating that the kids couldn\'t make any noise nor move around at all. Ok, fine. First of all, we expect the kids to behave. If she\'d left it with one mention, maybe we\'d have just sat down. But with repeated mentions of no noise, no moving around, it was obvious they didn\'t want us there. I told her I felt that way  and  she said that wasn\'t the case but it rang quite hollow.\\n\\nI went outside to talk with the family  and  figured we\'d probably go elsewhere as we really weren\'t wanted. Went in to tell the hostess (manager was nowhere around)  and  got a perfunctory sorry.\\n\\nJust seems like such a customer service failure. If they\'d wanted us there, they could have refrained from making us feel unwelcome. Or if they were uncomfortable with kids being in the bar or on the patio, they could have easily set us up in the empty restaurant  and  offered us the same food/drink.\\n\\nOr they could have told us their mantra \\no kids in the bar or on the patio, no happy hour in the restaurant\\"""" on the phone. \\n\\nMaybe it was a bad situation for them but if it were me, I would have tried a little bit harder to find a solution that wouldn\'t have so alienated us.\\n\\nI don\'t know. I\'m epxecting to see Chef Porter at OTFM  and  am friends with people who work with him  and  maybe we\'ll come back (sans kids of course) but right now it sure doesn\'t feel like it  and  it\'s a major bummer as Tapino seems like a place that is doing excactly what we love  and  we could have been huge fans."""""""\n'

aS'"""OK, the restaurant experience is only as good as its weakest link. This lovely little place has great food. However there are two big issues. First, the service has to be good. We got caught in the shift change. Our 1st waiter was fine but our second waitress seemed to care less we were there. Second issue, $2.75 for an ice tea (brewed), and $2 for a refill, give me a break. As sort of icing on the cake, the waitress (yes, the one that didn\'t really care we were there) simply brought us our check when we finished lunch. We asked her, \\hey don\'t you guys have pastries here?\\"""" Never had to ask for desert at a pastry place. \\n\\nAll in all a nice place to eat but they need to focus on getting the little things right to earn those five stars."""""""\n'

aS"I used to frequent this place when it was Long Wong's.  The food wasn't good back then but it was open 24/7 and always available.\\n\\nSince the change in ownership, I have been repeatedly disappointed.  The size of the menu has gone down drastically (which is understandable, Long Wong's menu was way too big).  They only serve slices of pizza at certain times of the day now (noonish until 3pm supposedly I think? and again some time in the evening) and you never know if they will actually have slices.  I understand that maybe they don't sell that many slices in the off hours, but I would gladly take a slice of pizza that was an hour or two old over none at all.  Not to mention even at 3pm it is not uncommon to get a pretty old slice anyways.\\n\\nThe burgers are so-so.  Better than McDonald's, but just really not that good.\\n\\nI've only had the cheesesteak once, and boy was it a disaster.  I bit into it and what must have been a full cup of liquid poured out of it.  I'm not sure how this was possible, but it was almost like it was sabotaged.  I'm sure this was a one-off problem and that they are not normally like that, but I was horrified and have not tried another.\\n\\nThe owner is eager and you can tell he is really trying to make the business work.  However, the staff he hires can be very rude sometimes.  I've heard some snotty tones of voice saying they had no slices when I've tried to order a slice of pizza during the off hours and have been refused a simple refill of my soda when my order took far longer than expected.  That said, I have not been there in a few months so this may have changed.\n"

Staff service is ok, but they had the order set up for to eat there. No biggy.   We got our order quickly and had ordered the medium fat burger.  I got the onion rings and my co-worker got the fries.  I could not taste any flavor from the burger, and the bacon had that crispy leaning on the side of burned taste.   The onion rings tasted like the onions were fresh, but still the taste was lacking.   Fatburger, I'll pass.  This place is one where I will keep driving past and not stop again.\n"

aS"My family has been going to Warner Family Practice for 15 years and I am now looking for a new doctor's office, as this office has become money hungry and difficult to work with.  Never in my life have I experienced an office that will double charge you for one visit if you discuss more then what is included in a well visit.  They will then continue to recommend appointments for you for things that could have all been taken care of in one appointment, just to get more money out of you.  My husband was charged for 4 different office visits just to have a yearly physical.  One charge to establish him as a patient, one charge for the physical, one for labs and one because he discussed more then what is allowed during the physical.  They should have a sign in their rooms stating what is allowed to be discussed and what you will be charged extra for.  My daughter also had labs done as a result of a well visit and was charged as a separate office visit, causing us to owe hundreds of dollars when we should have owed nothing.  During a well visit, they will also schedule you for several unnecessary tests, just to get more money out of you.  Offices like this are the reason our insurance rates are outrageous!!  Stay clear of money hungry Warner Family Practice!!\n"

aS"The dish was ok, but I won't go back. Here's why...\\n\\n1. The food was ok, but I've had better. It wasn't anything phenomenal. The lemongrass in my dish was hard, like I was eating a stick. I picked it out.\\n2. They bring community rice! WTF??  I want my own rice, not a tiny bowl for a table of 6 people!!  I understand their soup is community as well. Totally unexpected for an Asian joint, I have never heard of this before. It sucked, I got 1 freakin' spoonful of rice.\\n3. Even if they had brought me my own rice, it wasn't good anyway. It was hard and uncooked in the middle, and stone cold.\\n4. Portions are very small. This is compounded by the fact that I had to share rice! I was not satisfied when I left.\\n5. The server brought food out for half the table, then 3 or 4 minutes later brought out food for the other half. Are you kidding me?? \\n6. It is super loud inside. We actually couldn't even talk amongst ourselves because it was so loud. I felt like I was in a bar. It was weird, I think that was the first time I have experienced such a noisy sit-down restaurant.\\n7. And last but not least... no Panang?? Really?? This is a standard Thai dish and they didn't have it. Very disappointing.\n"

We did order reds as well for the beef, but by that time not even the overtaxed waitresses could lift our spirits.  They are wonderful, but not worth wasting an evening at this outhouse.\n"

The bartender was very rude to me and after six times of asking for a menu I had to flag down a server to get any help. It took 2 hours to get an order of wings and I was very unhappy with the service. Armadillo is great if you go during happy our and sit at a table, but I would never recommend going to the bar.\n'

We waited over half an hour to get menus and then only got 4. We dealt with that and passed them around. That was the least of the issues. About 45 minutes after sitting down, our orders were taken. The bread baskets finally came. I waited about 20 minutes for a refill on my coffee and then went and got it myself. I also got extra napkins, which we had asked for, and refilled some water glasses for my group. Some of us ordered from the \\Cafe Express\\"""" menu, because we thought that would be easy and quick. Not so! It took at least 45 minutes from the time we ordered until ALL of our party had their food. That is inexcusable! When the food came, some of it was wrong, but we didn\'t dare send it back for fear that we\'d never get the right food returned. Some of us would have ordered dessert, but figured it would take too long to get it, since our waiter, Tony, kept on complaining about the number of tables he had to cover and how overworked he was.\\n \\nOn the \\""""Cafe Express\\"""" menu, it states that if you don\'t get your food in 15 minutes, it will be free. Since they had WAY exceeded the time limit they themselves had set, I pointed that out. If it had only been 20 minutes, we would have let it go, but this was well past that. I was told that the 15 minute time limit  did not apply to large groups, though that is not stated anywhere. After some discussion, we were told the manager would adjust the bills, but it was because we insisted that they honor the commitment they made, not because they wanted to. I am not sure if the problem is in the kitchen or out on the floor, but it needs to be fixed.\\n\\nI will still go to Mimi\'s, just not that location."""""""\n'

aS"I don't write many yelp reviews but I thought that I would do one on Prado because it has changed a lot since my last visit and people might not know. \\n\\nI've been here 2 -3 times now with my girlfriend and others.  However, the first two times were about a year ago when the restaurant had more of a spanish theme. \\n\\nWe went this past week (11/19/10) and were disappointed with the new italian menu. \\n\\nThe menu differed greatly from the one posted online, and also the one posted near the front door. Our guest was very disappointed because he had picked out what he wanted to eat while having a drink at the bar before dinner, and none of his selections were on the dinner menu once we sat down. \\n\\nI ordered a calamari appetizer that was an interesting idea but did not taste very good (not traditional fried calamari). It tasted very earthy, slightly like dirt.\\n\\nI had a crab pasta entree that was good but not memorable. My girlfriend ordered a whole (roasted?, cant remember) Branzino with gnocci. The gnocci were good, but the fish was overcooked and dry.\\n\\nMost importantly, the new menu no longer carries the amazing churros that Prado used to serve for dessert. Sometimes we went there just for churros. The new menu features desserts from the Julia Baker chocolate shop next door, which we also visited after dinner. The shop is cute and the chocolates are great, but the churros are sorely missed.  We also had some awesome paella from the old menu that was much better than anything we ordered off the new menu. \\n\\nOverall, our tourist guest was disappointed and I am going to remove Prado from our lineup.  There are many other comparable choices in the area that I prefer.  Among others, T Cook's and Lon's at the Hermosa offer the same fancy resort feel, and have better food in my opinion, now that Prado's menu has changed.\n"

aS'"""I have to agree with the other reviews. \\n\\nI lived here from January 2008- January 2009.\\n\\nThis place blows and I absolutely hated living here.\\n\\nThe units are outdated, dark, and depressing.  If you live on the first floor you have no wall on your patio, aka no privacy. Kitchen appliances were terrible, carpet was cheap and uncomfortable. If you don\'t have a washer dryer in your unit, there\'s only one public laundry room that had 4 washers and 4 dryers, for like 800 people. \\n\\nThe PARKING. UGH!!! The worst. If you live here, you only get one assigned covered parking space. Mind you, there are only about 12 \\free\\"""" parking spaces. So, if you have a roommate, you guys are screwed. If you want to have friends over, tell them to get a ride or take the bus! \\n\\nWhen we moved out, we were charged $900 for \\""""damaged carpet\\"""". We never had pets, weren\'t smokers, maybe had 2 or 3 stains on the carpet. $900, what a scam! Had we known we would\'ve replaced it ourselves before moving out for half the price! When we tried to inquire as to what the damage was they wouldn\'t return our calls or speak to us about it. \\n\\nThey also have a pretty open pet policy, No weight restrictions, so I was basically always stepping in huskey shit. Not their fault if people don\'t clean up after their dogs, I understand, but honestly this must be one of the only complex\'s in Scottsdale that doesn\'t have weight restrictions for pets. Which sounds like a good thing? Maybe to people that are cruel and think it\'s okay to have one or  more 50+ pound dogs in a tiny space. I however think if you have large dogs you should live, I dunno, in a house? Maybe one with a back yard?\\n\\nThe only reason to live here is because it\'s somewhat cheap.

We paid for 2 full-year memberships. We paid nearly $500 each, which I feel is high for a gym. Don't go here if you are interested in a serious workout... All the women come all dolled up. And all the guys are meatheads (especially the trainers, who need to really lay off the roids).   \\n\\nThe gym is very nice... clean, good/new equipment. The reason for the 1 star, however, is due to their policies and lack of customer service. When joining, they rush you through the contract to get you to sign, skipping over the fact that you are responsible for inquiring any additional fees that they deem as necessary. So, after my boyfriend and I had been working out at this location for a month, we got a bill in the mail saying we owed an additional $52 for their renovations. EXCUSE ME!?! This gym is like 5 years old... \\n\\nWhen I called to ask what specifically the charges were for, the manager told me it was for the new IMAX Theater, valet parking.... the list goes on. Are you serious!? Valet parking at a gym? I've never heard of something so absurd. Get exercise and walk to your own car... This is a gym for goodness sakes!\\n\\nThey refused to take the charges off my bill even though I would never use their useless new amenities.

I must pretense my review with the fact that I\'m a purist, a little bit of a snob and opinionated.  I can appreciate tea blends - I make certain ones myself.  They serve a place and a purpose.

In fact, you\'d think that\'s the main focus of a tea shop, but here it seems blends and spices are what keeps things together.\\n\\nThey have lots of \\teas\\"""" and accessories.

We did call-ahead seating, we got there, we waited for an hour, and we finally split up and sat at opposite corners of the restaurant for dinner.

aS"I was in the area for a conference so I got the opportunity to spend my per diem money on their all you can eat sushi.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  So disappointed that I just couldn't keep eating it anymore for the sake of being full.  I actually went somewhere else, because I was still hungry, and got a sandwich.  \\n\\nThe reasons why I didn't enjoy my meal:\\n\\n1.  Rice was super mushy.  Eventually, every sushi they served me had medicre rice, which totally ruined the whole meal.  \\n2.  They put so much rice in their sushi so that AYCE diners will get full sooner.   I actually had to tell the sushi chef to kick back on the rice.\\n3.  The fish was not as fresh as I am used to in Southern California.  One of the servers told me that this was a common complaint by non-local diners. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I didn't go back here during my remaining 3 days.  I actually preferred the Japanese mall food court restaurant over this.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Benihana...but this one failed me.\n"

aS'"""Like many other reviewers, we tried Padre\'s because of a Groupon. \\n\\nWait staff was competent, and our drinks stayed mostly full.\\n\\nWe had the calamari as an appetizer: very overpriced at $10.95, I liked the flavor (its got a little chili mixed in with the breading). I like one of the three dipping sauces, and my wife liked a different one. When the waitress asked if we liked it, my wife indicated it was greasy and chewy. She apologized, but not really convincingly.\\n\\nFor entrees, I had the garlic shrimp tacos and my wife had the \\Tia\'s Enchiladas\\"""" with spinach and cheese. My tacos were 3 small tacos with a decent amount of shrimp, cilantro, lettuce, and a pineapple salsa. They weren\'t bad, but were not very garlicy. My wife\'s enchiladas were good, nothing special. The ever-present sides of refried beans were typical of the variety, and the rice was well done with good flavor. Contrary to some other reviews, I would have called the plate sizes ordinary and not \\""""huge\\"""".\\n\\nFor desert, my wife and I were going to split the banana epanadas with brandy caramel, but asked for it to be served without the brandy, as my wife has a severe alcohol allergy. The server checked with the manager and said they could do it, but that the caramel would lose a lot of its flavor without the brandy, and said it all burned off in the cooking. Well, from experience, my wife and I know it isn\'t true (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Food_and_cooking), so we asked for it anyway.\\n\\nThen the server went to place the order and the cooks said the brandy was pre-mixed with the caramel. We cancelled the desert order. It was a bit frustrating that the manager didn\'t know how the dishes were prepped in the kitchen.\\n \\nOverall, it was typical mexican food with a \\""""modern\\"""" take (apparently if you put pineapple salsa on shrimp tacos and a fancy swirl of sauce on the enchiladas its \\""""modern\\"""") -- personally, there are much better Mexican restaurants in town."""""""\n'

aS"ON A SHOE STRING ?\\nThis place has a really nice tap beer selection. In the first months after they opened I went back 7 or 8 times until I had tried most all of them. \\n\\nI tried three or four different menu items. The food was OK. Wife loved the crab cakes. \\n\\nService was always very friendly but they frequently seem to be operating with a skeleton crew. Like the same person is the hostess slash bartender slash waitress slash cook slash dishwasher. I usually just stopped in to try a different beer so when the server dissapeared for long stretches of time it wasn't that big a deal. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is a little off.  They have this great tap selection paired with a tiny 4 stool bar in a really big pub. Odd set up.  In another area their are some high tables right next to the main eating area which are booths. So you could be trying to eat a nice quiet restaurant style lunch just feet away from jukebox blasting, beer swilling, pool shooting hooligans. There is just something not right about the floor plan.  It is like they ran out of money before they could remodel the inside to fit the business.\\n\\nI still visit every so often because they change up their draft beer selection. Unfortunately because of the atmosphere and staffing quirks it is not a place I can throw an extra star or two.\n"

I was invited to lunch here by a colleague who had dined here many times in the past.\\n\\nI felt the lunch menu was perhaps a bit overpriced, given the quantity and quality of food.\\n\\ni ordered the kung pao shrimp ($8.25), which was a spicy dish, but ordered it HOT.  It came so mild I might as well have ordered shrimp in lobster sauce, with some peanuts thrown in.   There were about 10 peanuts, a 1/2 cup of sauteed green onions, and about 4 medium sized shrimp, to go with fried rice that had nothing in it and an egg roll the size of my thumb.  It WAS nice it came with hot tea.\\n\\nWas it outrageously priced?  Absolutely not.  Would I eat here again if someone invited me?  Of course.

aS'"""I go to Mill Ave quite often with my friends because it\'s the cheap bar hopping street to go on a college budget.   Zuma Grill is often one of  the places they want to start their night because they usually have some sort of cheap drink special. \\n\\nI do not go for the food but if you\'re looking for the nightlife experience be forewarned.\\n\\nFirst off Zuma is fairly small and gets really crowded especially on the weekend and it takes some time to finally get a drink from the bar. Once you actually get up to the bar I feel like the bartenders are very pick and choosy about who they serve, esp the women bartenders. I am a female and I swear every time a girl is bartending she helps every single guy before she helps me. I hate to talk badly about other girls but I feel like I\'m not welcomed because the girls send out bad vibes. \\n\\nOne night when I was out with my friends they mentioned that a  drink was 2 dollars on special that they just got so I ordered two for me and a friend. When I got my bill it was 4.50 each and I said my friends just got this for $2 and they said they didn\'t know what I was talking about.  I was completely offended and wouldn\'t of ordered the drink and my friends were like why did she charge you more?  And this was around 9 pm when there was no one in the bar and it wasn\'t even busy. \\n\\nOn Halloween weekend last year when it was especially packed and the music was way too loud to even hear myself talk I worked my way up to the bar and asked if we could have 2 Zuma juices on separate cards. The girl that was bar-tending made a mean face and ignored me and helped everyone else that came after me to the bar(that were guys). I was waiting for maybe 10 minutes until I finally was like put it all on my card. She helped me hesitatingly and made some comment (that I couldn\'t even hear) and when my friend asked for her name she said \\Don\'t worry about it\\""""  I was not drunk there was no reason for her to refuse to serve me and I didn\'t think my request was an outrageous one. \\n\\nAfter these stints, and along with all the guys that go in there being extremely douchey(and always running into you because it\'s so damn small in there) and really nothing cool about Zuma that they offer I REFUSE to spend any money there. I am always spreading the word of their bad service and when my friends suggest to go there I recommend some other place to go.\\n\\nAlso their bathrooms are tiny with 2 stalls and looks like no one ever cleans them or the floors in the entire bar for that matter.  Also an added bonus is the bouncers only let a few people in every 5 minutes and of course allow the people that they probably know or slept with in in front of everybody. And they try to get you to pay them to get in front of people when you ask why they let other people in.\\n\\nThey also play the same generic music most bars play and there is nothing unique about Zuma. If you just feel like standing around in a tight packed bar not hearing what anyone says and getting terrible service then I guess it\'s a good place for you.\\n\\nIf you\'re new to Mill Ave and are looking for the Mill experience I suggest you pop in next door to Cue Club (which can also be packed but you\'ll actually be able to have a conversation with someone and play some pool!) that has cheap long-islands lots more room and awesome bartenders who are always friendly. \\n\\nZuma has yet to redeem themselves. My suggestion is to have a friendlier staff that doesn\'t think they\'re better than everyone walking in."""""""\n'

aS"Damn you Yelpers you steered me wrong!!  I agreed to go to this place only after reading all of these glorious reviews on Yelp, only to be in for a rude awakening upon my arrival.  \\n\\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the phrase you get what you pay for has never rang more true for me.\\n\\nI love Middle Eastern food, like seriously, no joke.  So how excited was I to try a new Middle Eastern restaurant not too far from my office with ridiculously low prices?? You can probably figure it out from there.\\n\\nThe meal started out okay.  I got a pretty darn big piece of Spanakopita for $1.95, which excited me.  It was decent, not very flavorful to be honest but for $1.95 I'll eat them all day long. My boss ordered a side of hummus to start, and his story was pretty much the same.\\n\\nWe then both ordered the Chicken Kabob sandwich for a whopping $3.99 and I was stoked. Until it arrived that is.\\n\\nI took one bite and could tell right away that something was not right, with the chicken I mean.  After I taste a funky piece of meat, that's it. I will not be taking another bite. It just won't happen.\\n\\nI did however perform a little surgery on one piece on a side plate to discover that as I suspected, the inside was pink, as in NOT FULLY COOKED.  It took a bit out of me to not get sick right there at the table.\\n\\nI was hungry though so I tried to eat around the chicken, only to discover that this was the dryest chicken kabob sandwich I had ever had.  I probably should've figured that out by watching my boss douse his with the entire appetizer of hummus to add some flavor, but what can I say, I like to figure some things out on my own.\\n\\nAll in all my meal ending up costing less than $6, which was sweet, except for the fact that I didn't really eat anything.\\n\\nOh, and I should probably mention that we got back to the office and my boss didn't stop bitching all afternoon about how badly his stomach hurt. I believe that's called salmonella : )\\n\\nAnyways, I'm a bit surprised that I had such a lousy experience with so many great reviews before me.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe all the reviewers before me were blinded by the price, regardless, I won't be back to find out.\n"

My wife is still home... apparently they showed up around 1.  Sorry, but that is not freaky fast, at all!  Then they have the nerve to say I am out of their delivery area.  Then what are you doing?  Did they tell me this and say it make take longer than usual, NO.  Did they decline my order for delivery, NO.   Not to mention why they heck am I out of your delivery range...I live at 87th  and  Bell - 1 mile from your shop.

Chef's choice sashimi, it does include some of the harder to find specialities.  We also had the Grilled Pork Belly which had great flavor, but the amount of fat was too much to handle.  The crispy fried squid with chili and lime was flavorful.  Overall the flavor, atmosphere and service was good.  But that's just it.  It was merely good.  I can't complain about the taste or quality of the food, but I can't write home about it either.  I've been known to pay a lot for a meal.  This one was not worth it.\n"

I don't think I have ever had such a greasy burger.  I was excited to see fried pickles on the menu, since I haven't had fried pickles since I left the South.

This location has a major problem with spotty service, and you never know what you will get. Sometimes, it's great, with an attentive, personable server.  Just as likely you'll get completely ignored even when it's not busy. About 6 months ago, my husband contacted corporate about the problem. They were apologetic and seemed truly concerned, and even sent a $40 gift card as an apology. We've been back a few times since then, and I will miss the garlic fries and southwest chicken sandwich.

I did this not because of the error, that happens, no big deal.  I cancelled because of the very rude attitude and customer service of the office staff.  In June I gave Probest my debit card number so they could just automatically deduct the monthly service from my account instead of writing a check each month.  I was charged in June and then double in July.  I called in to inform the staff of the double billing and they said they would have to call me back.

She seemed like an older lady with a southern drawl and genrally unpleasant attitude and seemed uncomfortable with their billing system and technology.  On our third go-round where she insisted I wasn\'t charged for June I told her in a firm (I stress I was NOT rude, yelling, cursing, etc... just firm) tone I was indeed charged in June and I expected it to be fixed.  This is where she turned from generally irritated and unhelpful to flat out argumentative and belligerent, yelling at me that it was my fault because I wasn\'t helping her enough.  I asked her calmly but firmly to please cancel my service and I would take up the issue with my bank.  She then hung up on me without saying another word.  I had to call back to confirm my service was in fact cancelled, she said she hung up on me because \\once I said I wanted my service cancelled there was nothing more to discuss\\"""".  \\n\\nRoughly a half hour later she calls me back and sheepishly says she found the charge for June.

She was going on about how much paperwork she had to go through to find the charge, as if I am the one responsible for the poor billing records.\\n\\nFor what it\'s worth the service itself was pretty average, the guys showed up and were nice enough, however I never really noticed a change in the scorpions I was looking to get rid of.  \\n\\nFinally, I\'m NOT accusing Probest of impropriety but it is a general curiosity and coincidence that after several years of never having an issue with my bank/card that shortly after my dispute I had fraudulent charges on the same debit card I gave Probest."""""""\n'

aS"Thanks for making my birthday dinner horrible! First, I would like to say that our waitress was courteous and very nice, but the food tonight was inedible! My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner, it was my favorite place and we have been coming here for 8 years. I ordered the lobster bisque and he ordered the clam chowder. Both soups were very very salty, but I was ok with that and ate half my soup. For the main course, he ordered the blackened catfish and I got the sea bass. My hubby took one bite of the fish and knew it was bad. I took a bite and yes it was very bad, not just bad in taste, but it tasted rank/sour. My sea bass was good, but what made me mad was that we told the waitress and she said she would have the manager come over and talk to us...... We waited and waited.... I ate my dinner alone while my hubby had nothing....... Finally the waitress came over and after two glasses of liquid courage, I gave her a piece of my mind. Evidently, that brought the manager over. My hubby didn't want to risk another choice from the menu and I was finished eating. They comped our meal, but that didn't make my birthday any better.... And Pappadeaux, no need to respond to my review because no apology is going to be good enough to have me dine in your establishment again.\n"

aS'"""I thought I would have a chill evening with the boys. We have been waiting what feels like forever for this place to open! So we were so excited. Hubby\'s out o\'town and we came up here. There was a crush so we decided to place a to-go order. As I was standing, ready and waiting to place my order, they fielded calls from people and took phone orders right in front of me. I could have called from my cell phone while standing there and been ahead of myself? So I end up placing my order and  I left and came back after 40 minutes (couldn\'t keep my kids calm in there that long) and they don\'t have my order. Poof. It had disappeared. An employee kept asking me for my phone number even after I told them I  had ordered it in person. I actually had to tell her to stop and listen to what I was saying. Finally the manger comes over and I came up with my receipt. The manager looks at it and keeps saying, \\He rang it up wrong. This says delivery.\\"""" (The person who helped me was female, so I have no idea who he is talking about.) Then the employee who took my order came over as the manager is about to hand me 2 salads. He read the receipt number incorrectly, she informs him I ordered a pizza. Then after a few clicks on the register he said to me, \\""""I put your money back on your card.\\"""" And he walks off. This paragon of communication says nothing else so I assume it was a dismissal and I head for the door. I had 3 hungry, tired boys and, apparently, I needed to go find food elsewhere. At this point it had been over an hour. I was trying to navigate the stroller out the door as the gal who took my order chased me out and promised to deliver it for free. I was afraid it would taste like sawdust just because I was so angry. Fast forward another half an hour...We get our pizza and I was trying to be objective. It was doughy because it was undercooked and the bottom was positively coated with corn meal so in turn it coated my tongue every time I took a bite. And looking at my bank account today, I see that the expansive loquacious manager did NOT reverse the charge. So I paid to wait almost 2 hours, listen to my kids whine, drive there twice, be ignored by employees, disrespected by  management only to finally be disappointed by the corn meal pizza. The garrulous manager probably refunded those people their salads. I hope they were better than my pizza. :("""""""\n'

It is absolutely not their fault that food is mediocre. Actually, what was strange is that they charged our CC just the amount on the bill and did not include the tip my husband left. Bill was $26.40, my husband signed for $31, but online I see a charge of $26.40 only.  I don't know if I should call and make sure that waiters got their tip... I guess, I will do it on Monday.\\n\\nWe ordered pho chin ( well done brisket ). The broth was good, but nothing spectacular, brisket itself was still pretty chewy and tasteless. I expected it to be at least a little bit better, but if you are hungry and want something hot, go for it. The portion is very generous.\\n\\nVegetable Cha Gio (Fried Vietnamese egg rolls) was completely soaked in some oil, which totally ruined the dish. It looked like their fryer was not hot enough when they dipped rolls for cooking. Another possibility is that oil was old. Neither of the scenarios excites me.\\n\\nVermicelli with seasoned grilled shrimps disappointed as well. There were only 5 tiny shrimps on the top, pretty rubbery but tasty. The rest seemed to be 2 pounds of vermicelli.\\n\\nI don't know what everyone else with 5 star reviews ate there, but whatever we had was not that. I don't mind cheap, ethnic food, and I know that it can be inexpensive but still very good. \\n\\nI will not repeat, but I encourage you to try.

aS"I have been here to eat twice and while the first experience was ok the second time\\nhas me writing of the place for good. I will say the service was always speedy and quick both times but when we went to brunch the menu has better options like the chiliquiles.\\n\\n My problem is the limited menu during lunch time and the quality of that food. The table side guac was ok and some could say great if they prefer it one way more than another. I would say it wasn't close to Salty's but not terrible like America's taco shop on 7th st. There menu consist of two basic options excluding the soup during lunch, tacos and tortas. Their tortas remind me more of something you would find at a wildflower except without any good mixture of ingredients. you would think that if you only served 5 different things you would be really good. I don't mind a small amount of choices, even if you think of your own home rotation of meals you cook for your family you could limit it to your top 5 things and have a menu that would kick the crap out of most restaurant menus I am sure. I had the brisket torta which seemed to be a mix of a lox and a thin(super thin) layer of burnt beef. My girlfriend thought the same. My friend had another one that looked better but she said she wouldn't rush to come back for it. The side of beans were ok and the chorizo and potatoes were ok more for the potato side as the chorizo was semi bland and couldn't hold a candle to any Shreiner's offering.\\n\\nSo we had a 90$ lunch (no alcohol) that had faux latin food. When I went to brunch my girl did like the drinks and the chiliquiles are good but you could do better from any torta chain with little effort and just suffer from the ambiance for better food. Guero's tortas comes to mind but like I said even Subway could own these guys.\n"

I had the appetizer platter and the chicken with white rice and weird white sauce with a dry side salad. It was a bland, white platter of food. Plus, what's with the side salad of iceberg and radishes? Is it garnish? It's not dressed with anything and, you know, tastes just like a pile of lettuce. \\n\\nMaybe I'm just an ignorant prick.

They wanted to rush our dinner order also which I don't understand considering how empty it was and the more laid back vibe I had been told to expect in comparison to NY. I might have ordered appetizers had I been given enough time to decide.\\n\\nI got a combo plate that had a cheese enchilada  and  chile releno. The sauce had a bit of a skin on it, but everything tasted OK for fast food Mexican standards. The corn tamale filling that they give a tiny scoop of is honestly the best thing on the plate. The rice was overcooked and hard. My husband had the same but added a beef taco that was just as unmemorable. One of our dining companions had a veggie fajita that turned out to be mostly potatoes and that seemed to be the most diet friendly thing on the menu. \\n\\nOverall, the food was edible which is more than you can say for alot of chain Mexican places.

The place is very unassuming and actually has a very comfortable feel. We were absolutely confused where to go when we walked into the restaurant. You can\'t tell where the bar ends and the dining room begins, and they don\'t have a set up hostess stand (the one they have is in the middle of the room) which you can easily find. Our hostess looked at us oddly for a couple of seconds before I let her know \\were here for dinner......\\""""\\n\\nAfter being seated, our server came over and we told her it was our first time and needed her help choosing. She described everything to sound absolutely delicious so we ordered away. I started out with the Picolo, a drink made with jalapeno, tequila, lime, and muddled seasonal fruit. Sounds delicious, but this is where the night took a turn for the worst. I took a taste and just about dropped my glass and my head twitched.... it was so tart it was undrinkable. I\'m a guy who likes my sour candy and sour anything, but this was almost painful to drink. I told the server and she started laughing and apparently assumed I was kidding??? \\n\\nI ordered three tacos, and a side of rice. I first tried the Cochinita, which I have to say was an absolutely butchered dish. Does this white boy need to go over and give lessons to you people about how to properly cook a Mexican dish? YOU DO NOT PUT GUACAMOLE ON COCHINITA PIBIL. You also don\'t used tough, chopped pork. You use shredded and slow roasted pork. You don\'t put chunks of fruit in it either. You ruined one of the greatest Mexican dishes of all time. The Carne Asada had a wonderfully textured and tender quality, but fell flat on it\'s face when it came to flavor, of which it had none. I tried the Ahi Tuna taco as well, which also was covered in guacamole. You can\'t just cover all of your food in guacamole and pass it as mexican, unless you are trying to hide a lack of skill in the kitchen. I ate my \\""""guacos\\"""" (not tacos) begrudgingly. \\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the guacamole and proclaimed it to be completely average, but I\'d have to say otherwise. I took a bite on a chip only to find a big chunk of orange slice. Really? People order this, and then come back and order it again? This is actually the second Mexican dish you\'ve managed to butcher, after the cochinita pibil. I won\'t even start on the rice, which was not cooked properly, was covered in cilantro... and I mean COVERED, and was borderline cold. \\n\\nService here is good enough, but I had the feeling the whole time that our server was simply going through the motions. When she laughed and told me she was glad I liked the drink I was complaining about, all the way to the end when she asked why we didn\'t finish the guacamole and couldn\'t understand why we weren\'t licking the bowl, she just flat out was off. \\n\\nThe meal was absolutely a bastardization of the Mexican cuisine. You all are trying to damned hard to be \\""""cute\\"""" and made yourself look like inexperienced buffoons in the kitchen. I have to tell you that this place is probably only surviving because it caters to a niche and because some yelp superstar decided they like it, and all their sheep friends followed. If this place had to survive on it\'s own in the real world (outside it\'s \\""""I\'m to hip to go anywhere that cool people wont see me\\"""" atmosphere) it would fall flat on it\'s face, just like every other restaurant this hotel has dreamt up."""""""\n'

The doctor, who was quite nice, gave the junkie a prescription for naproxen sodium (Aleve).

I won't complain about the typical parking charges and internet fees that always occur at 4 star hotels (even though the restaurant/bar downstairs is called freaking NETWORKS! duh). \\n\\nHowever.....the thermostats are waaaay outdated and don't work that well, can't open a window, awkward check in - they now have a self check in computer (like airline ticketing) but the desk lady still takes your DL and credit card and runs them through the machine....standing on your side of the desk. Just kinda awkward. \\n\\nYes, the elevators are neat and fast and the views are cool, but CLEAN THEM. No excuse for those things to not have the snot-nosed kid handprints wiped clean a few times a day. The employees ride them too, right? \\n\\nI got a beer at Networks, downstairs. 1 beer = $6.01 + tip (not sure why I did tip) = $7.01. FOR 1 BEER. \\n\\nWanted to watch the Dbacks game.....neither front desk nor concierge could tell me how to navigate my remote away from the corny adult movie ads to normal TV, or tell me what channel it would be on. \\n\\nAbout that thermostat.....mine didn't work. Called front desk, they sent someone up. Took 45 minutes, but they fixed it at least. I'm just used to outstanding service with Hyatt, 45 minutes for a fix-it visit is too long. \\n\\nIt is modern, beds are comfy(as expected), you can see the Dbacks stadium from your room, just BYOB and hope you don't need help from the staff. \\n\\n2 stars on a Hyatt scale.

Those who greeted us when we arrived and left displayed impeccable service.\\n\\n..so, why the two stars? I suppose it\'s unfair, but a fact of life, that an experience is remembered not by how much went right, but how much went wrong. Our foursome came to the golf course after a long conference, expecting an opporunity to unwind, talk business, and enjoy some fun after a few days of work. It appears we were scheduled to play ahead of two scratch threesomes. We fell about a hole behind those in front of us, and had planned to start letting those behind us play through at the 1st par 3 opportunity on the Raptor course.\\n\\nRight before we got to the first par 3, we were accosted by the rangers. No polite request to speed up play, or to let those behind us play through. Instead, we were critiqued for our slowness of play, and the trouble we were causing those behind, and if we \\planned to speed up\\"""", as if we were playing slow purposefully. \\n\\nSo, we allowed the 1st 3-some behind us pass through.. and immediately on the next hole, were accosted by the very same rangers! Now, we could still see the 3-some we just let pass through teeing off on the hole ahead of us, and yet we were accosted for our slow play.\\n\\nSo, regardless of the service we received coming and leaving, regardless of the beautiful vistas, all I remember when I think of this golf course is our discourse with the ranger, which is a shame."""""""\n'

It would seem that whoever is managing this place now cares more about what the place looks like then whether or not there is actually anything worthy of shopping or eating at.

First off, our table was given cold bread.  -  Not room temperature bread, but COLD.  Next, the food was only so-so...I had the spaghetti  and  meatballs.  The spaghetti was ok, the sauce not so great, and the meatballs were totally dry.  My partner ordered the pizza.  The crust was on the thicker side, and the sauce too sweet and very greasy.  \\n\\nThe worst part was the service.  We were on the fence about ordering dessert, when our waitress came and quickly dropped off the check....rushing us out.

I ordered chicken wings...an hour later (no joke, literally an hour), the wings came out and i ate 4 of them. My friend told me to look down on my plate. As i look down, it looked like the chicken had been murdered, yes, they were bloody and raw. Im not saying I wasn't a dumb@$$ for not looking at chicken while i eat it, but damn. I told the waitress and she took them off the bill, a small compensation for what ensued later that night. About 5 hours later, i get home from work, and i start crapping and puking simultaneiously. This went on for 8 hours. I called the doctor to see if im going to die, he said possibly... and to keep slamming water. So i did, i kept myself awake out of fear of death in my sleep by dehydration.

The sauce was really sweet and almost too much as you could barely taste the truffle oil even though you could smell it.  Next the tuna in the spicy tuna roll was brown(?) and not spicy, must have been with a mild soy sauce, and accompanied by only cucumber inside.  This was my least favorite.  The rainbow roll was good and what we expected, albacore sashimi was good but not the best I have had.  Sunshine roll had tuna with a mango sauce that was a refreshing fruit sauce to the palate since most of our rolls were sweet, salty, and or creamy/rich.  The baked scallop roll was okay, too much mayo in the overcooked scallops and was drenched in eel sauce.  The creamy baked lobster roll was the best, with lobster tempura on top of the roll with eel sauce.  Lobster was cooked just right.  \\n\\nI really wanted a lava cake for my bday but she said they were out which was disappointingly surprising since it was early, like 9:30 ish.  So we said we didn\'t need anything else (code for \\""""you can bring the check\\"""")  but still waited for the bill. No luck so I put my coat on as a hint.

aS'"""I have been CRAVING Indian food lately and after hearing about FOI from a coworker and reading the reviews here, I decided to try it out for lunch. Ok it is a buffet, I knew that, but I have been to some very good Indian buffets. When I walk into any ethnic restaurant and I see people of the same ethnicity of the restaurant eating there I get excited. It must be good right?   This table must have been family and eat for free because I have had better. The naan was just ok, the Tandoori chicken, meh (well I have never been a big fan of this anyway because almost anywhere it is usually just dry bland chicken to me). The butter chicken type dish with tomatoes, was ok but looked like they added red food coloring. I enjoyed the flavor of the meatball dish, the palak dish was bland. Honestly the only other dish I found interesting other than the meatballs was the Carrot \\pudding\\"""" which was sauteed sweet minced carrots, went back twice just for that. The sweet rice was ok, it had raisins and coconut.  I generally prefer it without either.\\n I may go try it one more time and order off the menu for dinner. Give it a fair chance before completely ruling it out."""""""\n'

aS'"""HORRIBLE---no, NON-EXISTENT customer service!  Which is a shame considering they have good pizza.  I ordered 2 pizzas, wings, a 2 liter and extra ranch; an hour later, the delivery guy showed up with 1 pizza and wings.  When I told him that the order was not complete, he just rolled his eyes and rudely informed me their online ordering was \\messed up\\"""".  Then shoved the pizza and wings at me without apologizing or offering to correct the mistake.  Problem was, I had already been charged for the whole order so I was not about to take less than half of what I paid for.  I told him to cancel the order and he turned and stomped away without another word.  I immediately called the store to make sure I would be credited for my screwed up order that the delivery guy made no attempt to correct.  I asked for the manager when they answered.  The girl who answered said to someone in the background (without putting me on hold so I heard every word): \\""""Someone wants a manager.  I guess that is you.\\""""  The  \\""""manager\\"""" told her he didn\'t have time to talk to customers and proceeded to yell at her about all the work he had to do....uh- FYI buddy, customers are THE REASON YOU ARE IN BUSINESS so it would be a good idea to make time for them!!!! The poor girl came back to the phone after being totally berated by the manager, and I told her what had happened with my order. She offered to credit my card for the order.  Only problem is, it takes 48 hours to process.  So now I am out $40 for the next few days, I have waited over an hour and still have no dinner, and I was treated horribly by not one (delivery driver) but two (manager) Mama Mia employees.  I told the girl on the phone that the delivery guy and manager should not treat customers so rudely, she apologetically agreed.  I asked for the contact information of the owner; if this were my business, I would want someone to let me know if my employees were treating customers like dirt.  She could not provide the contact information but offered to call someone named Frank and have him call me back to resolve the situation.  I never received a call.  Apparently, the \\""""customers are not important\\"""" tone is set at the top in this business.  There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix, save yourself the hassle and the headache, order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service."""""""\n'

aS"My last visit there ended in a total mess. I ordered pick up, the item i had problem with was the bean curd family style with vegetables, as the waiter seem to think it did not exist. So I had to point to him where that was on the menu. Once I did he said that must be a new item, it wasn't as I have ordered that every time I visited in the last 2 years.  His excuse was it was new to him as he had not seen the time in two years. After telling him the other items I had to re-point him to where the tofu dish was. I told him he should write the number down for that item, he explain the cook did not go off of that.\\n\\nWhen it was done they handed me a 4 item meal in one bag. Keep in mind I live about 20 - 25 minutes away. When I got home I found instead of tofu dish, I had a shrimp dish. I called them, and the waiter asked if i was sure it was wrong.  Just a hint tofu is square, shrimp is not. After making it clear the dish was wrong he told me he would have to find the cook to see if she would replace it. I decided I just wanted my money back on that item. That was until I went through the bag further.  The egg rolls were on the bottom of the bag soaking in fluids from the other meals. Unlike most Chinese take out these guys do not put it in boxes and bag it separately if it will leak,instead they put it in styrofoam. That was the last straw I decided I wanted a full refund.\\n\\nWhen I got there I had a replacement to my order, despite the fact I stated I wanted a refund on the phone. I also stated I wanted all of my money back as I showed them pictures from my iPad of what my meal looked like. First excuse was the guy was new, seriously three months should be enough time to know your job when handling orders. The worst part was it was my fault that fluids from my food leaked on everything according to the manager. I got my refund, but the manger does not understand what went wrong. Clearly I will not be going back again.\n"

aS'"""eh, I don\'t know how to even start this. I guess I\'ll start on the positives the staff was very nice and I used the restaurant.com coupon so I got about $40 dollars worth of sushi for like $22 after tip. Also, the interior was really cool looking and the little sake bottles along the wall that had been signed and stuff was a nice touch. Now the problem is that this was probably the most bland sushi I have ever eaten. It\'s not that anything was out right disgusting (maybe it was due to blandness idk, but it wasn\'t full of any weird nasty flavors) but I didn\'t finish much of the food at all.\\n\\nI had a good mix of different rolls.. firecracker (i think) which sounded good with spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, along with a spicy tuna, a vegas, and the sushi sampler with various nigiri. The prices were cheap so I wasn\'t expecting anything amazing but lets just say if I had paid full price I would have been severely disappointed and this might have gotten one star. Everything was just bland and the definition of \\Meh\\"""", the nigiri had super thin slices fish on it which isn\'t a terrible thing but it was on a HUGE ball of rice so I was basically eating riceballs. The spicy tuna which is hard to mess up was just not good at all. The rest was just more of the same. \\n\\nOverall, this place is getting a gift with two stars. I really like sushi and I have no problem eating it at cheaper places (think Ra happy hour or even Teharu Sushi) but this is honestly a place I won\'t be coming back to no matter how cheap it is."""""""\n'

aS"BS West is only getting two stars because of the easy parking and the layout of the place.  It can support alot of people without feeling like you are getting bumped and pushed.  The bar runs across the place so you never have to go far to get to the bartender.  Too bad you will end up waiting a long time because of the unattentive bartenders.  I have been there with a friend waiting 15 minutes at the front of the bar while the bartender had a conversation with a friend.  Another big problem with this place is the customers.  No one here conversates with others outside their group (I tried).  The customers are almost as rude as the bartenders.  The drinks are very expensive for the quality of alcohol you will be getting.  I realize it is in Scottsdale which is supposed to be nice and normally I don't mind spending more for better atmosphere and service but you will not find it at BS West.  It is a complete rip-off!\n"

I ask the guy standing at the entrance if there\'s expectant mother parking.  He says no, but that I\'m free to park in the area where they\'re directing those with handicapped plates and placecards.  I thank him and drive over to the grassy knoll.  I don\'t even have a chance to put my truck into park before some guy comes running over telling me I cant park there.  I very strongly said, \\Well I\'m pregnant, and the gentleman right over there said that I could.\\""""  He doesn\'t say another word.  The woman in the car next to me then said, \\""""They\'ll end up giving you a ticket.\\""""  I state that since this isn\'t technically handicapped parking - No signs that state HC only parking - They technically don\'t have the right.  I then remembered where I was and I didn\'t really feel like fooling around with tribal cops.   I throw the truck into reverse and get in the line to head to park with the rest of the cars.  \\n\\nWe finally get to the head of the parking line and next thing we know, we\'re being told parking is $5.  NO WHERE ON OUR WAY INTO THE LOT WE WERE PARKING IN DID IT STATE PARKING WAS $5!!!  We were livid.  No where on the event website did it state that parking was $5.  We pretty much yell this to the min. wage lot attendants.  AND - Where does SRPM get off charging people $5 to park in a f-ing DIRT LOT!?   $7 for parking for events at the State Fair location in Phoenix (which they have noted on their website)- to park on a paved lot.....Fine.  $5 to park on a f-ing dirt lot?  I told them where they could shove the car behind me\'s $5 and make a U-Turn to leave.  \\n\\nJ and I ended up going to breakfast instead - where we didn\'t have to pay to park.  \\n\\nFrom what I\'m told, and from what I\'m gathering with glancing at a few reviews - the Street Eats Festival was not worth it.

My dad talked Lucille's up like it was better than Pappy's in St. Louis. He raved about the biscuits, the ribs, and the apple butter for days before we attended my ceremony, and I was really excited to try the food. Disappointment does not even begin to describe our experience.\\n\\nThe restaurant was relatively empty at the time of our visit. The hostess sat us at a table that could, possibly, have doubled as the freezer. The AC was turned way to low on a relatively cool evening, and I was shivering throughout my entire meal. I know that this isn't the hostess' or the waitress' fault, but my mom asked several times if they could turn up the AC or move us. \\n\\nThe food was terrible. I ordered a full rack of ribs for $26.99 and they were burnt to high hell. Paired with the AC, my whole plate was cold in five minutes flat. I ordered Mac and Cheese as both of my sides and that was decent. My parents also split a burnt full rack of ribs, and my boyfriend had an average tasting pulled pork sandwich. We were served terrible quality food for the pricing of this restaurant. \\n\\nOur waitress was really nice, but I think she should have noticed how burnt the food was that she served us. I understand that we visited the restaurant at 9:20pm on a Wednesday evening, but their website showed that they take reservations all the way until 9:30pm. It is just really unfortunate that this establishment doesn't take more pride in their product. People go to restaurants on memory making occasions, and a bad dinner can ruin a good moment. Lucille's would do better to remember that in the future. \\n\\nTL;DR Burnt food, terrible for the price, will ruin your graduation experience.\n"

I\'m more apt to get a sub for lunch than do a sit down, which the average bill goes from $8 to $15-$20 with tip. and last time I ate there, which was last week for dinner with a buddy, I was annoyed that while I was eating the server asked me if I wanted a beer after I already ordered coke. This was after I had already been served and was drinking it. I just felt like it was kinda tacky, maybe even pushy. You see, I had a DUI last year and i\'m more sensitive to drinking and driving these days. I drove that night and did not want to drink alcohol, hence ordering the coke. So, why would a server be asking me if \\i want a beer or something??\\"""" To boost the bill maybe? Yeah, I think so for sure. \\n\\nAs far as the pizza, I\'m not here to advertise another restaurant, I just know that there are better deals on pizza.

aS"Okay, I want to like it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food. \\n\\nFirst, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish. \\n\\nFor lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit). \\n\\nFinally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.\n"

It started with the salsa; the one thing I looked forward to the most, as chips and salsa are one of the staples of my diet.

It was however, attentively refilled. But seeing our server so many times before reaching an endorphin-boosting caloric level made the interruptions a bit annoying. \\n\\nI really want to skip to the best part though, so instead of describing how unpleasant our server was, how our food was served at a nuclear-hot temperature and quickly turned icy in the arctic corner of the bar (as the common area was the polar opposite -- hot, crowded, and littered with crying children,...), how our nachos were covered in quite obviously right-out-of-the-can green chillies, and unacceptably dirty silverware,... was their \\hot\\"""" salsa (NOT HOT,...

What I do know is that we have been there many times and the one constant is the shiiiiiiiitttttty service. Here\'s an anecdote: \\n\\nThree friends and I went to Ten to get some sushi. We ordered sushi. My little deal is I like to order spicy tuna rolls but--get this--add avocado. Because avocado is good. The couple with me orders a spicy salmon roll, which ordinarily comes with avocado--except that they didn\'t want the avo. So, among other things, we should be receiving spicy tuna rolls *with* avocado and spicy salmon rolls *without* avocado. Backwards, yes. \\n\\nWell of course I wouldn\'t be writing this if that\'s what had arrived. No, alas, we got our rolls but sans modifiers, i.e. spicy salmon with and spicy tuna without avocado. So I politely pointed this out to the waiter. The appropriate response would be: O. M. G. I\'m so sorry--be right back with the correct order. Nope. The waiter looks at the rolls and then goes to check with the sushi chef. He returns and tells us (!) that the rolls are actually correct: that salmon colored roll is indeed tuna, and the tuna colored roll is, in fact, salmon. When confronted with the issue of salmon colored ties (not to mention half of Craig Sager\'s wardrobe) being named after the wrong goddamned fish, the waiter could only muster a vacant stare and offered to talk to the manager. TALK TO THE MANAGER? \\n\\nSo the manager comes and reiterates: yes, that is indeed tuna. \\The one colored like salmon?\\"""" Yes. \\""""And the tuna colored one?\\"""" Salmon. Ah. \\""""Would it matter to you if I told you that I ate the \'tuna\' roll and it tasted conspicuously salmony?\\"""" No, that is indeed tuna. We add to our tuna (insert name of some made up, nonexistent spice that turns tuna salmon color and vice-versa) and that makes it look that way. \\n\\nNow I\'m making this story drag, I admit. But the concept of someone so brazenly lying to me (or just being plain fucking stupid) is highly irritating to me. If it weren\'t, I\'d watch fox news. But no, the manager and waiter all stuck to their story. What I should have done is played along and ordered a spicy \\""""salmon\\"""" roll, complete with avocado. But I was too pissed to do that, and so instead I argued with the manager and embarrassed my friends. Sorry all. \\n\\nMoral of the story: Ten has mediocre food and fucking dipshits working the sushi bar. If you trust these mensas with raw fish that you\'re about to eat, go ahead. Otherwise I recommend Celsius or Shogun. (reviews to come, maybe.)"""""""\n'

aS'"""Y\'all are officially on notice.  Why?  It was based on these reviews that I decided to try the place.\\n\\nI was totally prepared to wait when we arrived because we got there at about 7:15 on a Friday night.  They said 30 min wait for a party of 5. Not too bad.  After watching 3 groups who came in after us be seated first (and yes, one was a party of 5) we approached the hostess stand to check on things.  Suddenly we were \\next\\"""".\\n\\nServer was Justin.  He said his hellos, told us about the specials, took our drink orders. We\'d planned to try a few appetizers, but at that point we were all hungry enough we wanted to go right for the main course. Then we were brought the chips and salsa.  I inquired about the 3 salsas.  He said, this one is hot, this one is pico de gallo, and this is our pineapple salsa.  The chips weren\'t just \\""""got out of a bag\\"""" chips, they were no-name, not very good, wouldn\'t serve them to my friends chips.  But, we nibbled on them anyhow because we wanted to try the salsas.  I went right for the hot.  Hot?  It was barely warm.  It was very \\""""tomato\\"""" tasting, with one person commenting that it almost had spagetti sauce taste.  How can you be going for a Latin flavor and not be packing any heat??  I try the \\""""Pico de gallo\\"""".  It\'s chunky salsa.  But whatever.  It had that fresh taste that many salsas have fresh out of the bottle.  My last hopes were the pineapple salsa.  It was different, and in the end the one I actually liked the most because at least they were trying to be creative.\\n\\nCan you believe I\'m not to the main courses yet?  Justin sets them down quickly and makes his escape.  Visually - they were quite good.  2 of our folks got tortas - one beef and one chicken.  They were \\""""fine\\"""".  Both tortas and the burgers come with fries and the fruit slaw on the side. No one liked the slaw.(Friend said it was more straw than slaw)  To me, it was ok - but not worthy of the large portion it took on the plate.  Would have been MUCH better to just fill the plate with the waffle fries that were actually pretty good.  One person got shrimp enchiladas.  That was pretty good - but could have been done just as well or better by quite a few places in town.  I got the pork loin chops.  Honestly - with this being one at their highest price point, I figured I should really get to see their strength here.  It was pretty.  The two thin chops were cooked fine - but it wasn\'t cooked IN anything for extra flavor, which pork really needs.  It touted an \\""""herby garlic, cilantro, lime sauce\\"""".  It was green, and not bad, but with those things you would have thought it might have had more kick.  Or at least flavor. It wasn\'t bad in a way that detracted from the meal, but it didn\'t add much.  The green beans were at that same \\""""fine\\"""" point.  They were very green and looked great.  But beyond the almonds someone threw on top (again, not cooked with at all, just threw on top at the last minute) there wasn\'t much flavor.  ( I buy the big frozen bag from Trader Joe\'s, steam them, toss w/ a pat of butter, salt and pepper and they could kick the butt of these green beans. I didn\'t have that high of a bar, but they didn\'t even meet it.)\\n\\nThe night was capped with some poor service mistakes.  Several of us had discussed trying a desert.  Instead of a request for desert, we got a check.  We figured it was a sign.  We were dividing the check into 2.  A friend who had been a server suggested that we mark the items that went on a particular card and then it was easiest for them to split the check.  We were explaining that to Justin as he was seemingly running from the table. (Did we have ebola and no one told us?)  When he accidentally put the wrong total on each card, and we asked him to switch the totals, rather than go do it, he was argumentative at the table for several minutes about how he did it right and kept trying to push fault to the friend who handed him the bill. he then stormed from the table (like a 2 yr old) saying as he went, \\""""Fine, I\'ll just have to go switch them\\"""".  Yea, that\'s all we\'d been going for.  The whole table felt uncomfortable and insulted.  A friend noticed we were \\""""dropped off\\"""" to go boxes when all other tables had their food taken away and the server put them in the boxes.  I don\'t know if we just had an awful server or if he thought we\'d be bad tippers (I\'ve never gone under 20% for good service - bad never gets less then 15%) but it will be a long time before any of us go there again. The atmosphere was cute, but the food was not a good value and never really rose above \\""""Ok\\""""."""""""\n'

aS'Average burger, average taste, above average prices. Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food. If you want cheap cheese, bland meat, and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place. I go to Columbus OH for work, Graffiti burger is the place over there. They have a big sign over the Five Guys in Columbus. I passed by the Five Guys, almost empty, go to Graffiti, PACKED. There is a reason for that, they serve the best burgers around. I so wish AZ had a place like that. Until that happens, I am in search for the best burger in AZ.\n'

aS'I have to say, I have not been impressed with most of the food I have had at the Biltmore Fashion Park and Stingray Sushi did not disappoint.  One of the worst meals and dining experiences I have had, at least in regard to sushi.  Where do I start?  Do I start with the server who helped us at the sushi bar?  She took our drink order but unfortunately it never came so we just had water which in the end was a good thing since the food did not have much flavor.  I did not think it was that tough to serve up a Coke and a beer but it proved to be a request beyond their ability.  From there it went down hill.  My two hand rolls were loosely rolled and almost fell apart as I ate them.  In addition, there was little to no flavor.  Then came the 9-11 roll and that was pretty good, though for the money it was not a lot of food.  Next my Chilean Sea Bass came and it was definitely overcooked.  I could have sent it back but at this point I just wanted to get the meal over with and leave.  What followed was the clincher that sealed the deal and allowed me to call this the absolute worst sushi I have ever had.  The last roll I had was the spider roll.  Anyone who has had a spider roll knows that it is made with soft shell crab.  Well my spider roll had plenty of shell but it certainly lacked the crab.  I have had lots of soft shell crab made many ways and hands down this was the worst.  I could never recommend Stingray Sushi at the Biltmore to anyone unless you have no clue what sushi should be.  Eat at your own peril.  If you want better sushi than what is served at Stingray, just go to your local market.  Yes, the sushi is that bad there.\n'

aS"My roommate and I went here fir the first time today. The price was the only thing that was great. The chicken was dry, the tzatziki sauce was bland and thick, and the so called Greek dressing on my side salad tasted like cheap bottled Italian. The fries were ok, hummus was bland, and I said no onions on anything, yet onions were on EVERYTHING. needless to say, I will NOT be going here again. I can't even say that this was the McDonalds of Greek restaurants cause I would have rather eaten an McDonalds.\n"

aS"Went there to watch UFC fight. It was packd!  1 waitress and 1 bartender to handle the whole top floor was not acceptable.  She was running around just trying to keep up.  I felt terrible for her.  All customers around were complaining about not getting service.  I felt it was not her fault, maybe management needs to be changed.  There are enough people looking for jobs, they could have easily had 2 more servers and at least one more bartender upstairs.  We were there for an hour and I finally went to the bar and asked if we could get the waitress over, it took her at least half an hour, it wasn't that she wasn't running around working, we saw her, she finally got to us, we ordered a round of drinks (one beer and 1 vodka), a salad and chili dog.  The 1 beer came out right away, vodka?????.  The salad came out an hour later, and the chili dog a half an hour after that, it was barely warm and and no cheese.  The french fries were cold.  We finally cancelled the vodka after an hour and half waiting.  If they would just hire more people to work, that place could have made bank that night.  Management better start checking out there reviews and take some action or they will be out of business before too long.\n"

aS"So I went there to buy the new Nook HD as a Christmas gift.I might as well have been buying a magazine for as much customer service I received. There was a display of all the Nooks, but nowhere did it say to go to register to buy it. The display, nice as it was, could not answer questions I had. This is not my first Nook purchase as it seems they come out with a new one each year, however I still had some questions. I went to the customer service counter and asked where I could find the Nooks to purchase. He curtly told me they were at the register (as if I was to have already known this). I went to the register and was helped ( well, I wouldn't really call it helped) by a woman whom I'd really like to name here, but won't. Her disinterest in my purchase was evident and I was guided in buying the wrong screen protector.  Again, this wasn't a cheap purchase, and I was the only one in line until an obvious off-duty employee came in and they exchanged their hellos. The gift was well-received, and with the gift receipt the recipient was able to exchange for the correct screen protector. This wasn't one employee giving bad customer service...this was 2. It's a no return store for me.\n"

aS'"""If my current issues are resolved, I will revisit this review and edit. However, my current situation is this: in the past 24 hours, I have had 2 visits, taking nearly 4 hours! When making the appt, I received no information that a \\contact lens exam/fitting\\"""" would necessitate 2 visits. During the exam, when I hesitated having my eyes dilated, i explained to the student that I spend a lot of my work hours in the car and still had to work that afternoon. She explained that it would only affect \\""""some blurriness when reading up close.\\"""" Wrong!! The minute I stepped into the sun, I was rendered incapacitated and could barely keep my eyes open a bit to drive home. This necessitated my having to take 2.5 hours of PA time from my job - in addition to the 1.5 hours my exam took. I was told that the next day I would see someone specializing in contact fittings. Wrong!  The student I saw the next day was extremely nice, but had no clue what he was doing regarding the proper product, prescription, and fit. I spent 2 more hours with this student on trial-and -error contacts. The doctor looked in on us twice for less than a 5 minute total. Again, she was very nice but nothing was being accomplished. They sent me on my way with a trial pair of lenses that I had to remove and throw away 3 hours later because I could not drive in them......everything was blurry and driving was not safe! Did I mention I TOLD them that I drive a lot in my job???? I have worn lenses before, and all my friends my age wear lenses, so I am assuming this is possible with the proper expertise.....but that is the one thing I am not getting. I have been \\""""invited\\"""" to go back tomorrow and have no idea if I will do that. Neither will I pay for a service I did not receive.\\nUpdate, 6/21/12: I returned to my previous optician, which I previously thought to be over-priced. They fitted me perfectly with a different prescription in each eye, and I have been wearing contacts daily since. In the future, I would only use Midwestern for frames, as they have a good selection."""""""\n'

This was when the Coffee Plantation was locally owned, had coffee carts on campus at ASU, and the coffee was actually somewhat good.

MY MISTAKE.  \\n\\nI rolled up to the shop after a long strenuous hill run and was in desperate need for some recovery fuel (within that critical 60 minutes).  Low and behold I had just missed them since they closed at 6pm.  But one of the guys was there running a spin class outside and let me in - pretty nice, I thought!\\n\\nI popped in, grabbed what I needed and headed up to the counter.

aS'"""Having spotted a $28 Dior Addict (Stiletto... a word that sounds sexy, yet dangerous... recall Fonda\'s Single White Female) I really wanted days ago at Sephora, I decided to check out two department store makeup counters to see if they were offering a \\gift w/ purchase.\\""""  (Turned out that the \\""""gift w/ purchase\\"""" promotion will not be offered till September.)  Macy\'s turned out to be my first and my last stop that day due to time constraints, the way I was treated, and the fact that the Macy\'s rep behind the Dior counter quoted me a lower price for the lipsticks I wanted to purchase- I was going to buy at least two ( Stiletto and Envy), and I also started looking into the $30 Rouge Dior colors and the $34 Serum Rouge selections.  Since I am not fond of returning tainted lipsticks, I proceeded to sample some of the testers using the disposable brushes they have for customers to use.  It wasn\'t long before a woman permanently parked herself behind and to the right of me where I could see her. Even though I greeted her a nice hello and continued to sample colors, after awhile, I felt so uncomfortable, that I decided I\'d just stick to the two choices I initially made, since I can always come back if I ended up liking the products.  \\n\\nThe original rep rang my purchases up, and the total was higher than I estimated it to be.  I asked her why, and she said that she\'d looked at another product\'s tag when I had asked her earlier for the price.  Since it was only a few dollars, I decided I\'d let it go, and left Macy\'s.  \\n\\nI returned to Sephora a few days later to restock on Clinique colors that I love.  I always buy three or more of these at a time to eventually replace the almost-new ones I have already, since the bases fall prey to Arizona\'s heat and break off.  (I don\'t have the patience, nor the time, to save these broken pieces in pots and apply them on w/ lipstick brushes.  I wish I did, for I would then have the extra cash to spend on my other hobbies of dining out and watching movies at Camelview!)  Anyhoo, I ended up buying five colors, which amounted to around $77, including tax (three for me, and two to gift Mom w/, because I like her).\\n\\nSee Macy\'s?  If you didn\'t make me feel like I was a marked crook by sending your guard, who was ready to jump me at the slightest move, I\'d have spent so much more money splurging on my favorite makeup items at your counters, rather than at other stores.  I\'m not even pondering on how the rep mislead me by quoting the wrong price-- OK I will... How could she do that when I specifically gave her the product\'s line and color to look up?  Nevermind.  I\'m making it a point to boycott this particular location.  Should I ever want to buy anything from a Macy\'s, I\'ll either go to the one in Chandler, or to another state even!  Perhaps I\'ll just spend my money at Dillard\'s and Sephora."""""""\n'

She offered sparking or flat when we ask for flat she brought out Fiji -- normally at nicer restaurants this is complimentary but we spent $24 on water which was a suprise given it was never mentioned.

The house dressing has a distinctive fishy taste, despite being told there were no anchovies in it. There were wilted pieces of lettuce on my plate, and the walnuts were not chopped making it difficult to pick up with a fork at the same time as any of the wilted lettuce.\\n\\nMy entree was equally as disappointing. I ordered the lasagna, generally a safe choice on a maiden voyage at an Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, this time that was not the case. There were at least a dozen layers of lasagna noodles, making the dish very pasty. Between the layers there was barely any sauce, no discernable meat and zero cheese. I ate barely a quarter of it, yet now, three hours later, I still feel like there is a brick sitting in my stomach.\\n\\nMy sister ordered the veal parm, despite my story of being stared at by an adorable baby cow on the back of a dairy truck for ten miles in traffic one day. She soon regretted her choice as much as I regretted my lasagna. Mushy and bland, she also barely ate half her dish - and only a forkful of the greasy side dish of pasta served with it.\\n\\nOur friend ordered a shrimp and pasta dish, which he found adequate. He was please that the shrimp were as large as they were and that there were a lot of them, but he still didn\'t feel the dish wowed him enough to pay $25 for it.\\n\\nI finished with a dessert of a ricotta-based cheesecake with lemon curd topping. This too was adequate, as long as the filling and topping was eaten after being scraped off the mushy, bitter bottom layer (one could barely call it a crust).\\n\\nWe finished our meal at 8 PM on a Sunday night, and we were the only patrons in the establishment. That in itself told us a lot.\\n\\nI know this place has been open since the \'80s, but I\'m not sure how. We won\'t be returning again."""""""\n'

I went back to get another sample cup, and upon walking back to the yogurt machines, the owner literally stepped right in front of me, blocked my passage, (\\""""got in my face\\"""", if you will), and confronted me by saying \\""""Are you serious, how many samples have you had?\\""""\\n\\nI was extremely taken aback, because that is not only the most unprofessional, but also the RUDEST, I have ever had an employee, let alone business owner speak to me before. I told him this was going to be my 4th sample, and he scoffed and started waving his hands around acting as if I had been trying to steal his product by only getting samples. He told me as a business owner he can\'t have people \\""""just sitting around all day eating free samples.\\""""\\n\\nI\'m not a business owner...but here\'s a suggestion. How about saying \\""""Just so you know, we have a sample limit of 3-4 per person. My personal favorite is _______, and if you like cheesecake, definitely try the cheesecake fro-yo with graham cracker crumbs!\\""""\\n\\nOn top of this, he had also stopped my friend right before he stopped me, again by getting up in her space and physically blocking her from walking anywhere. \\n\\nSince when is it ever okay to be that confrontational and invade someone\'s space like that?\\n\\nHe embarrassed me in front of the entire store and treated me so badly that I\'m extremely surprised he actually still has a business. Had my friend not already gotten a cup of frozen yogurt, I would have walked out. This is completely unacceptable.\\n\\nIf he was so upset about people taking samples, then maybe he shouldn\'t have the cups free for the taking. Make it so that you have to ask a cashier for a sample cup.\\n\\nAlso, calling yourself a \\""""business owner\\"""" during the same interaction where you get in my face, try to block my way to my seat, confront me in such a rude way, and then don\'t even let me speak because you\'re too busy scolding me with your hands on your hips as if you\'re a mother yelling at a child- is laughable and makes me wonder if you are actually that clueless about customer service."""""""\n'

aS"On a 6-hour flight to Hawaii, US Airways ran out of food! We were starving, because we didn't have time to grab food before the flight, so we were expecting to be able to purchase food once in the air. Since we were sitting in the back of the plane, all of the food was gone by the time they rolled their cart to us. Our lunch consisted of chips, almonds and cookies; these were basically our rations for 6 hours. Our first four choices of real food (ex: sandwich, salad, cheese/fruit, etc), were sold out. Plus, the flight attendants were less than friendly (to be fair, maybe it was just one in particular that was having a very bad day). Overall, we often dislike our experiences with US Airways, and will avoid them as much as possible.\n"

aS"Went here through Deal Chicken...$59 for $144 worth of food with a bottle of wine, seemed like a great deal - unfortunately, it wasn't.  White the food and service were both good - portions were miniscule.  We both had mussels as an appetizer, and were given a 1/2 portion each, with about 8-10 mussels.  The main course was OK, but the side pasta was less than about a cup's worth.  Dessert was cheesecake - it was a half-portion cut into two slices- enough for 3 forkfuls.  So, what seemed like a great deal was a huge disappointment.  In these struggling times I can understand that restaurants need customers, but to say they are giving $144 worth of food when dividing portions in less than half left us feeling ripped off.  Perhaps if they would have disclosed beforehand that the portions were smaller than the regular menu this would have been a different type of review.  It has certainly given me pause to consider something like this in the future - before purchasing it might be a good idea to contact the restaurant and ask.....live and learn.\n"

The only real standout was the cream-cheese filled puffs (ironically, the least authentic item) - the other items, including the sauce, were just off. The spare ribs were dry, the paper wrapped around the spring rolls was tough (telltale sign that they hadn\'t been freshly made), and the sauces were watery and had no zest at all.

My husband had the mango beef - I used to work at a Vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu, and there, it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce. Here, it was fatty chunks of beef with underripe mango in a sickeningly sweet, sticky sauce mixed up with a bunch of unrelated \\""""sauteed\\"""" veggies. My yellow curry chicken and shrimp tasted less like a complex curry and more like a meat and veggie mixture (think bad Chinese) tossed in a paper bag with a whole jar of curry powder. \\n\\nWhen the waiter came to clear our almost-full plates, he asked if everything was ok. Our philosophy is usually to say something in response to that question only if something is fixable (e.g., a meat can be redone to be less well-done). In this case, the whole restaurant concept seems to be centered on serving flavorless and poor-quality large portions to a university crowd they seem to think is un-discerning.

The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.\n"

aS'DH  and  I arrived around 6:30 and had reservations for 7pm, but wanted to have a drink at the bar to celebrate our anniversary, before dinner. We sat down at our table around 7, and asked for the summer menu, that was listed on the website. The waiter stated that the menu is not applicable for Saturdays. I stated that on the website it does not seem to differentiate. We proceeded to order off of the regular menu, we ordered 2 appetizers- buffalo mozzarella crostini, and tortilla soup- both were ok. For entrees we had the chicken jidori and the salmon. The chicken was moist, but lacked flavor, the salmon was ok, but really lacked any texture, the tomatoes, and gnocchi all blended together with the same texture of the salmon. We then had an ice cream sandwich, with pistachio ice cream, the ice cream did not taste like pistachio. I did not leave happy, since the food was mediocre at best.\n'

aS'"""Want to know a secret on how to waste nearly $50 in less than an hour? Come to RigaTony\'s! My husband and I live right down the street from here and watched as it was being built wondering what it would be. When we found out it was a RigaTony\'s I became disinterested. I have never eaten here and had no desire to, that is until my husband decided he wanted to try it. He knew it was an italian place and he likes to find new places where he can eat a bowl of pasta. I stalled going here as long as possible but Friday night I finally gave in and we went to dinner here. I think we came in around 6, which I guess is right before the dinner rush because there was no wait, but when we left less than an hour later there was a line out the door. And thank god we didn\'t have to wait because the people who line up to eat here are total fools.\\n\\nThe service was quick and our waitress was really friendly. That is the only reason this place gets more than 1 star. She was quick to bring us water and take our order. We decided on the portabello cloud as an appetizer, which sounded interesting. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and my husband ordered some seafood with pasta and cream sauce special that was being offered. Salad and bread comes with the meal and luckily I had read before hand that the salad comes with salami so I requested the salad without it. The only way that I can really describe this place is a lower quality Olive Garden. And I hate Olive Garden. The salad is basically the same with lettuce, red onions, tomato, black olives, and peppers, but instead of a decent italian dressing that I can stomach, this one is coated with cheese and a heavy dressing. I barely finished one serving, but I watched as the table across from me (two women and one child) devoured two bowls of it. Ugh. The bread was just ok. Its just bread. Our appetizer comes out and it was not what I was expecting. It was a portabello mushroom filled with cheese and a few smigens of tomato and spinach, deep fried and placed on top of a pool of basil cream sauce. If you don\'t care about fitting into your pants the next morning, this could be tasty. \\n\\nOur entrees were the same. Low quality Olive Garden fare. My $12 fettuccine was an embarrassment to the name. I make amazing fettuccine for less than $12 that can feed four people!! Do people actually come here and eat this garbage when you can make so much better at home?? And apparently there is flour in the sauce to make it thicker. Not necessary and made me lose my appetite quite frankly. My husband liked his meal at the restaurant but started to feel sick as we were leaving and we took our leftovers home but they ended up in the dumpster on the way into our house because we couldn\'t stomach the thought of eating this food again. When we got the bill and our total came to $40 I about passed out. I had to leave the tip in cash because I couldn\'t stomach the thought of adding more to our credit card. What a complete waste of money. The food was bad. Bad bad bad. Heavy, greasy, everything was covered in cheese or some kind of cream sauce. I hope this experience made my husband realize that food can be so much better. I hardly ate the next day just to counteract the amount of calories I ingested in this meal.\\n\\nOne more note. I know this is a \\family restaurant\\"""", but seriously. If your newborn baby is screaming its head off and the restaurant is full of people, please take the baby outside until it calms down. Its just downright rude when you let the kid scream in a place full of people who didn\'t come there to listen to your baby scream."""""""\n'

A lot of the donuts were out of stock, which I have no gripe about. I don\'t exactly expect them to cook a whole bunch of fresh donuts at night when no one wants them. I do wonder what they do with the leftovers when they close, and two robust older men loitering in the lobby gave me a clue.\\n\\nThe whole vibe of the place was \\we\'re closing soon\\"""" which bothers me quite a bit. Chairs up on tables, and the counter jockey managing to work the phrase \\""""we\'re closing soon\\"""" into his first sentence to us. Right, I get it. But no, my experience should be the same as the person who came in at 7 am, sorry.\\n\\nWe got a dozen donuts from the paltry selection (it doesn\'t look like even at peak times they have that many different kinds of donuts) and even the ones we ate that same night tasted stale and gross. I got the sour cream donuts and they left a strange coating inside my mouth that took about 12 oz of scalding coffee to wash away. Yuck.\\n\\nThe only reason it isn\'t one-star is because I already somewhat lowered my expectations due to going at night. However, if as a business you don\'t want to give evening customers a 5-star experience, then just save us all the grief and close at noon."""""""\n'

aS"Okay, so I call this dentist because I was having excruciating pain in my mouth. She agreed to see me on a Saturday Which was a plus. After filling out all of the paperwork, I was shortly sent to the back, where I was told what was wrong with my teeth. She said I needed a fill but didn't really TELL me what was wrong. Before she put a full in, she started to numb my mouth. MIND YOU, with a sharp long needle she stuck in my gums without any warning and no form of communication. She just ordered me to open my mouth more. After about 5 minutes, she said the filling was done and pretty much told me to have a nice day. UH... My mouth was still in pain, a little worse from when I came in. I had to ask the receptionist to ask the dentist to prescribe me pain killers! No communication from the dentist at all. The receptionist was very kind at least. However, I will not be back here again. Sometimes, I can't always trust reviews.\n"

aS"I really hate to do this, because I have been a fan of the Merc Bar for years, but its a must.  My fiance  and  I were looking for a place to entertain our wedding party the weekend before our wedding and it was clear to us that the Merc Bar would be the perfect place.  We love the atmpsphere.  It usually has a nice  and  mature crowd.  The service is usually good.  It was perfect.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, it was the management and not the lounge that ruined our perspective of the venue.  The manager (Tommy) was slow/nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of.....i.e. Whats your process for group reservations. \\n\\nHe seemed annoyed that I conntact him and unwilling to make time for us.  After several incomplete emails he finally called me, at my request, but it became clear, after 5 mins on the phone, that he did not want our business.  It was also apparent that he lacked basic customer service skills.\\n\\nSince, the goal of the evening is relax  and  enjoy our time with our friends, not to worry about bad service, we took our covo with Tommy as a hint that the Merc Bar would not be a good fit.  We need a place with a more mature management staff.....so, we're going with the Montelucia.

Wanting this to be good, we preserved and waited for our waiter  to have some free time for us.  \\n\\nWhen he finally did show, he was abrupt and obviously slammed.\\n\\nSince none of us drank the same wine, we each ordered by the glass.  This did not seem to amuse our waiter in the least.\\n\\nThe steak was average...maybe below average for the price.  I left half my steak (which I NEVER have done before) on the plate and our waiter did not ask if we enjoyed our dinners.  This is inexcusable.  He did have the decency to not ask us if we wanted deserts.  The check, I might add, was brought promptly.  I could not help but wish I had gone to Mastros or Oceans - or the TPC Grill.\\n\\nBottom line - If you can entertain your waiter by placing an order for an expensive bottle of wine and meet his schedule for getting your order in, you stand a chance of having a very expensive about or below average dinner.

It was the second time I had been here.\\n\\nThe first time was probably some time last summer, and all I remember is that I was unimpressed.\\n\\nDecided to give it another shot, and ordered the Peak Burger.  This burger sounded like quite a nice sandwich, with andouille sausage, remoulade, ciabatta bread, etc.  I made sure to order it medium rare, but it was clearly cooked to well done, without even a touch of pink.

aS'"""This review is for the brand new Los Favoritos located in Chandler on Alma School and Queen Creek Rds. Their location does not yet have a website listing as the 10 other locations do. I will admit, I am Mexican. I am a wonderful cook but even I like to take a break from cooking once in a while. I have been to many good taco stands and Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  I was SO disappointed in this place.  Sad, because it appeared to have good reviews. I will also admit that my husband (who is a gringo) and I both ordered different versions of Enchilada dinners.  Ok so here\'s my first complaint.  Unless you ABSOLUTELY ADORE green peppers, do NOT order their chicken enchiladas.  It should really be called a Green Pepper Enchilada with a bit of chicken thrown in.  Not only that, but gigantic chunks of onion.  It doesn\'t take a genius to figure out that those two ingredients are fillers so that they don\'t have to use as much meat.  My husband had a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada.  Hard to believe, but the cheese enchilada was full of green peppers also! My second complaint was the so called \\guacamole\\"""". It came in a 2 oz container and we were charged $1 for it.  That is ridiculous for two reasons: The small amount we were sold and the fact that it was some kind of fake pureed avocado. Guacamole implies that it should have onion and tomato, chilies, etc. in it..otherwise it is just pureed avocado.  Last but not least, they are very chintzy on the rice and beans. That is probably the cheapest thing for them to make and serve and yet we were lucky to get 2 ounces of each on our to-go containers.  As far as flavor, my husband, who is not Mexican, thought it was pretty bland, so so much for the authentic Mexican flavor.  That said, the price for the 2 Enchilada dinner was pretty low and now we understand why.  We will not be returning to this establishment."""""""\n'

aS"This is easily the worst golf course I have ever played.  There are several problems with it:\\n\\nFirst of all, it's a desert course.  Not that there's anything wrong with desert courses, but on some holes, the fairway does not start until 150-200 yards off the tee.  That's fine on most courses, but on this one, if you don't hit the fairway, it'll be nothing but dirt and rocks.  No rough or anything.  On most long holes, if you mess up the tee shot, your hole is blown.\\n\\nSecond, the layout is dangerous, especially on the back nine.  There is one spot where three holes more or less converge, and you are right in the path of errant shots from not one or two, but three holes.  You have to keep your eyes open or you can get nailed.\\n\\nThird, there is no enforcement of pace whatsoever.  We played there during the summer, and there was a line at the tee for most of the front nine.  In all, the game took 5 1/2 hours to play, which is ridiculous.\\n\\nFinally, very few holes have yardage markers.  Combine this with no GPS, and it makes club selection very difficult, if not impossible.  It's tough to get an accurate measurement by eying it or using the scorecard.\\n\\nThe only redeeming part of this course is an island green on the sixth hole, although I should note that it appears as if nobody bothers to repair ball marks there.\n"

aS'"""Soooooooo......\\nI want to first start off by saying that the service was very good. Attentive and apologetic. And they offered to give us dessert on the house. Let me explain: we were super excited about trying a new place and based off of the yelp reviews this seemed like a slam dunk. The listing states that it is a quiet and intimate place. Not so. The music, while good, was really loud and the people drinking in the bar must have been mic\'d because they were as loud as hell. One lady in particular favored the donkey style of laughter every ten minutes or so. That\'s fine, truly, it doesn\'t bother me. Neither does the fact that we waited over half an hour for our food to be served only to have it be wrong and returned. This was sadly due to a computer that must have been hungrier than us because it decided to eat all the orders. I\'m a very patient person and, barring someone trying to punch me in the face, I don\'t get upset quickly. Such was the case here. My sister on the other hand....not so much. She was about ready to flip the table and go monkey fudge on the kitchen staff. But I digress, what bothered me most of all was the complete blandness of the food. All of it. Not only was it lukewarm, it really had no taste. And the \\4 chili hot\\"""" red sauce tasted like warmed ketchup. When we asked the waitress if they had any hot sauce, she didn\'t understand what we meant. She seemed completely baffled that we wanted something with a little flavor.

I was leaving a for a long trip a couple of days later and told them this so they checked everything over thoroughly, made some recommendations on things that needed to be fixed and also showed me how to check my oil levels. \\n\\nA few days later, I drove to my destination in another state.  The following day, my passenger got in the car, she noticed a smell of oil that I hadn't noticed. I opened up the hood of my car only to find oil splattered all over the place and the oil cap lodged (luckily) in between some of the pipes in the engine. I was in a sheer panic and called the shop and left an urgent voicemail (It was evening) - not knowing what to do or whether the car was safe to drive.  There was little to no oil left in the tank.  \\n\\nThe next day I received a call and they just said just to fill tank with oil, clean the engine at the car wash and it should be ok.  They immediately defensive and were quick to say they didn't do anything wrong and that someone must have accessed my engine (within 2-3 days of the service?  really? i hadn't gone anywhere other than work and home and quick errands and i have a garage) or that I must've checked the oil and forgot to put the cap back on.  I basically told them that I wasn't interested in arguing about it...I just wanted to make sure that it was safe to drive 8-10 hrs back to the Phx area.  \\n\\nHowever, the whole experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. As much as I would like to give them another chance because I honestly believe that they are not bad guys, they are relatively fair and that they do a pretty good job, If my car engine had been totally messed up after that fiasco - it was clear that they would not have taken responsibility for the fact that they forgot to put the oil cap back on.  I think it was pretty obvious that they made an honest mistake and I just think it lacks character and customer service to have not taken responsibility for their mistake.

Wish me luck on the appointment!\\n\\n--UPDATE--\\n\\nthe Cox Tech (a stocky redheaded guy) finally got here an hour late, and comes in with a hell of an attitude, acting like he knew everything and the problem was my fault, blaming the receiver not cox as well as being told on the phone that he would bring cords and a ladder, upon getting here he said if it needed a new cord that i would have to schedule another time because he was on a schedule that didnt include that. after all this bullcrap and proving the box was not entirely the problem, he changed the head of one of the cords connected to my HD DVR it fixed the problem slightly. so he went and changed the receiver and blamed the receiver for being glitchy, new and giving off too much noise in the signal he finally got it working good enough he ran on out to his truck, started to leave and i realised he left one of the other tv\'s and the modem still unplugged. so i called him back in and upon repairing he growls and says \\ god, im soo stupid, i left the other things unplugged.   i bet by now you think we probably just come in and fix one thing by breaking another, well thats not how we work.\\""""..... pfffftt could\'ve fooled me, upon fixing this issue he runs back out to his truck and takes off, and after getting a complaint from the watchers of two of the other tv\'s i call him back again and he came back in and fixed them.\\n\\nalso forgot to add, the third time he came in he blundered through my house knocking things down, including a once-expensive camcorder. but being the nice person i am, im going to overlook it.\\n\\nhe also said the new cisco Explorer 8642HDC (that cox is giving EVERYBODY) he said there is a well-known widescale issue with the recording and playback, and that there should be a fix within a week. sounds great, cox giving out a box that THEY KNOW is broken.\\nonce again, i am very displeased with their service, customer service, and technicians. and i would most certainly not recommend cox to anyone."""""""\n'

While it is cheap ($6 the night we went, with free nachos and soda), in this case you get what you pay for.\\n\\nThe rink surface was nice, but the roller skates were crappy, and the back of the place smelled like urine.  There is also no air-conditioning, just fans.\\n\\nIf you really want to go skating and are looking for an adventure, give it a shot.  If you're looking for a classy date spot, keep looking.\n"

aS"I would love to comment on how good/bad their food was, but I can't. I showed up at 6:45pm, and they close at 7 per the sign I was looking at on their front window. However, they were closed when I got their, and the 2 girls standing there just randomly looked up at me while cleaning. I wanted to give them a shot for the first time, however, with them closing early and not acknowledging me about it when me and my friend where looking right at them, makes me not want to got back. What gives?\n"

aS'We had dinner in the old room next to the Bar area.  The food was fine but the service was pretty painful.  It was one of those dinners where to get the next thing we had to flag down our server or someone else.  I ordered a cocktail and waited almost 15 minutes for it to arrive.  We had to ask for bread and for the cocktail glass to be removed and for another wine glass to be brought and we had to ask for several other things as well.  It is hard to enjoy dinner and company when you are waving at servers all the time.\n'

aS"I remember we visited this restaurant more than a year ago and whatever we ordered was decent,  (my memory plays tricks on me). Well, we decided to go there on 4th of July, and it was a rude awakening for me. I don't know how one person can possibly eat their appetizer and a main dish. The prices are not cheap (for this kind of a restaurant), so Brio Tuscan Grill tries to please people by serving non-human portions. \\n\\nOur friend ordered one of their salads ($15!) - it was such a disturbing mess on that plate. I think they put every vegetable and fruit they had in the kitchen. Then I received my bruschetta - it was ok, but too much of everything on top plus I would prefer less balsamic vinegar. If you ever had bruschetta in rural Italy, I can tell you that this was not even remotely close to real Italian bruschetta. Of course, I got 5 big pieces for an appetizer. My spicy shrimp with eggplant was drenched in oil and eggplant was too bready. I ordered it instead of a main course, but couldn't finish it. My husband got himself lasagna. Ok, this was the final straw. Come on, you could feed at least 3 people (and I'm being modest). Lasagna was just ok, but I couldn't stand to look at the portion and the sauce, which came straight from a can. \\n\\nWhat is going on? Why are they oversizing everything? I felt as if I was an animal brought to a feeding before being slaughtered. Apparently, it is just me, because the restaurant was full, and it looks like a lot of people on Yelp really enjoyed it. I won't spend my money there anytime soon, but if you're willing to give it a try, share your main dish or expect to take it with you (considering you like it)\\n\\nOn the positive side, the decor is pretty and their booths are comfortable.  My husband really liked their artichoke and spinach dip. The service was nothing to rave about.\\n\\nBtw, what kind of Italian menu  has lobster bisque on it? I thought lobster bisque was 100% French\n"

aS'"""A friend of mine recently invited us to join for his birthday dinner at Fogo. My initial thought was \\what am I going to be able to eat here?!\\""""  but was assured that their salad bar was \\""""banging\\"""".  So, alas we arrive and the woman and I hit up the bar while we waited for our peeps.  She got a really great dark beer and I tried to go outside of the box and ordered a melon martini.  It was terrible, but I didn\'t want to send it back cause it was kind of my own fault.  The bartender, however, noticed my full glass and asked if there was something else he could get for me.  Thank you sir!!!  I got a glass of Malbec instead, and it was great.  Our friends arrived, and we were seated.  It was like a whirlwind of craziness after.  Our server twirled on over and explained super fast how the place worked and what it was all about.  He went around asking what we all wanted to drink, and when he got to my lady, he called her sir...annoying.  She clearly is a woman.  Whatev, stuff happens sometimes when you\'re high on meat fumes.  After he was done with our drink order, we all got up to grab some salad.  Now, I know that this place is a meat house, but if you\'re gonna charge me 23 bones for my salad bar, please, make it great!  I grabbed some lettuce and started walking around to see what else I wanted.  There were these huge asparagus piled high, so I grabbed a few.  Then I grabbed some green beans, huge beet slices and broccoli, too.  I went to the dressings and was kind of disappointed.  There were ranch, caesar, and what looked and tasted like zesty Italian from Kraft. Boo.  Everything looked really good, but nothing was seasoned at all.  I mean, I appreciate being given the option to season my own items, but plain bland everything?  I want some flavor people!  \\n\\nOnce seated, meat on sticks came from every direction.  It\'s kind of funny to watch.  Two of my dining companions ordered limeades, and no joke, had to ask for refills from multiple people (at least four times!) before someone came by with a pitcher.  \\n\\nThe boyfriend of the birthday boy decided to propose that evening, and asked them to please bring the ring out on the dessert plate, and they did so very well.  I\'ll give them a star for that.  It was cute and sweet, both literally and figuratively.  I just ordered an after dinner coffee for my dessert, and everyone seemed please with their treats.\\n\\nUgh, then when it came time to pay, we decided that I would put $100 on my card and the rest was in cash.  When someone FINALLY came by to pick up the bill, I explained this.  He looked very confused. So, I repeated \\""""Just 100 on the card and the rest cash.\\"""" Simple enough, right?  Not so much.  It literally took about ten minutes for someone else to bring our monies back and when they did, the guy used all the cash and put the remainder of $61 on my card (I\'m just glad is wasn\'t more than what I asked him to put on)...but still, I serve bro! It\'s not hard to do!\\n\\nI was completely underwhelmed by my experience here and do not plan on returning.  At least I won\'t suffer from any meat sweats.\\n\\nNEXT!"""""""\n'

However, they quoted me $70 (I knew I needed some extra crappy service), charged me $120, and then \\did me a favor\\"""" by taking 20 bucks off. $100 for an oil change and changing light bulbs.

aS'I used to really love this place and came often and would have given 4 stars. I forgave the horribly unkempt entrance that is liken a Van Buren back alley because they had terrific food and drink specials all the time. But unfortunately all good things must come to an end and this place is no exception.The quality of sushi has taken a nose dive, and the service is borderline abusive.

aS'"""Alright, I\'ve waited until I settled down before I wrote this.  It\'s about a new establishment that opened in Surprise, Uptown Alley.  My wife and I used to be in several bowling leagues and sponsored several teams.  Then, we moved to Surprise.  I was excited when I heard about a bowling alley opening in Surprise.\\n\\nMy daughter was celebrating her 32nd birthday.  We thought what a wonderful way to check out this new place.  First, dinner at the RED EMBERS with a few cocktails, opening presents with a few more cocktails, a birthday cake and a few more cocktails, followed by a few lines of bowling for the entire family (Party of 8), and possibly having in a few more cocktails.  This ain\'t gonna be no cheap date.\\n\\nTo make things easier, and to add an element of surprise, we decided to take the custom birthday cake we had made to the restaurant where we were to have dinner.  That way, they could serve it for dessert, surprise my daughter and really embarrass her with \\HAPPY BIRTHDAY\\"""".  We have done this several times, at many restaurants.  \\n\\nMy wife takes the cake to the restaurant and is told they can\'t accept it.  After a brief conversation, she returns home, and not very happy.\\n\\nI call the restaurant, ask for the manager, and engage in a very long conversation.  I explain we\'re neighbors, this is our first experience with their place, it\'s my daughter\'s birthday, etc.  She blames County regulations for this decision.  I inform her that every other establishment we have gone to with this has gladly accepted and served.  She stands on her denial, based on County regs.  I inform her that my wife has several years in Food and Beverage management, including many years at Arrowhead Country Club, and that no regulation exists.  She stands firm.\\n\\nNot to upset the daughters, my wife and I continue as planned.  The food was okay.  Mark, our server was good.  I believe, as an attempt to pacify, our server comped a birthday brownie after dinner.  Too little, too late.\\n\\nAs for the bowling experience, again so-so.  Too dark and too noisy.  Ghetto boys in the lane next to us did not enhance the experience.  We had our Grandchildren there and the language and actions from our neighbors was deplorable.\\n\\nThanks for ruining a special day for our family!!!!!!!!"""""""\n'

aS"I've been wanting to go here for years from hearing such great things and finally made the pilgrimage out to Tempe. I have to say it was a total let down. I met a friend there for lunch and ordered the special of the day. The special consisted of a tiny cup of mushroom rice soup (smaller than the capuchins cup,about 3oz) and a tiny 4 inch chicken sandwich. The soup was ok and the sandwich was bland. The sandwich was burnt black at the bottom and consisted of about 3 shreds of chicken and a thin layer of cream cheese. I can't believe they served it to me and I am not one to complain or send things back so I didn't say anything. \\nI wanted to try their macaroons but after having such a dissapointing lunch I didn't even bother. \\n\\nAll in all, crappy food at a such a high price.

If this place were actually British, you could throw on poor service as well.\\n\\nGreat location, poor service. They've got a pretty good selection of beers to choose from but the thing that kills this place for me is the service. I had to go up to the waitress to give my order and go to the cashier to pay my tab. It's not like the place was busy either. The only time she came to our table was to serve us our drinks. What's worse is that she just had an attitude the whole time too. It's a shame this place sucks because the area it's in is cool, as is the antique house it operates out of. Do yourself a favor and go hit up some other bar like Hanny's or even the bar across from this place.\n"

aS"This place needs to close their doors, get their act together, and then reopen. The atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant. The food is horribly boring and has no flavor. I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing! We also got the nachos (which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef). In addition, the server didn't put in my order for my pizza, hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating. One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well. The only thing I liked was the beer, and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill. Way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best.\n"

aS"The food may be good, but I wouldn't know since this place asked me to wait for over two hours to be seated for a table for three.  To be fair, we went in on a Friday night around 7:00 with no reservation.  There were quite a few people waiting for tables and the restaurant was overflowing with people.  I placed my name in with the hostess and was informed it would be a 45-55 minute wait.  Fair enough - seems like a reasonable amount of time to wait on a Friday with no reservations. We wasted time by walking around Scottsdale Quarter and having a juice drink at True Food. We ventured back to Sol and were able to find a spot at the bar.  I had the skinny margarita, which was tasty enough, but nothing special. My guy had the house margarita and he said it was average.  After an hour of waiting, I went to check on our table. The hostess said it would be another 25 minutes for our table to be ready.  We were enjoying the people watching, but growing hungry nonetheless. We decided to wait sice we had already waited this long.  After another 35 minutes, my beau, who is not as rational as I am, went to speak to the hostess and was told it would be yet another half hour. At this point we were looking at a two hour wait with no end in sight. How could we trust them not to ask us to wait another 30 minutes? We left, but not before my cranky guy chewed out the manager. Maybe you could chalk this up to the growing pains of a new restaurant, or the inability of a young staff to properly gauge the wait and manage their tables, but my experience left me thoroughly disappointed and I will not be going back to try the food any time soon.\n"

I don't know what is with the women that work there but they suck at customer service. I ended up having to ask the young man that works there to take our order after three other tables that had arrived way after we arrived had recieved their food before our order was even taken. He was great as usual but it still didn't  make up for the poor service we recieved that night. I will not be returning to that place ever again and I plan to speak to the owner if I can. So if you like bitchy women who neglect you and leave you starving  and  watching others eat then this is your place.\n"

Eventually California will fall into the ocean and we'll have beach front property and we'll be set. I digress. \\n\\nThis BevMo particularly is really well stocked and large. Larger than a lot of California ones and the people here are all really helpful. If they don't have something in stock, they can order it for you and get it in pretty quick. They used to have a great bar in it with wine and beer tastings but it's gone now. Some problem with licensing - I'm assuming liquor license. I can empathize with the bureaucracy.

Yes there is a long wait (2-3 Hours sometimes) but if you can't find any friends that you would like to spend a few hours with next door at the bar drinking wine and eating a cheese platter and some olives, then maybe you should just call for delivery and stay in your cave.  The ingredients are minimal on your pizza but you can' TASTE the freshness, and that beats all greasy and heavy pizza in my book!

aS'"""Let\'s talk about the good things at Moto.\\n\\n1. Beer. The owner (who splits his time between CO and AZ) doesn\'t mess around with \\typical\\"""" beers. You won\'t find Budweiser, Miller, Coors, Heineken, Corona or any of their \\""""lite\\"""" varieties. Usual beers found on tap are from Four Peaks (local brewery), Stone Brewing (San Diego), Avery Brewing (Boulder, CO) and various other craft brewing companies. \\n\\nAlong with the beer comes an in-frequent \\""""beer celebration\\"""" held at Moto. This happens for Stone Brewing Anniversaries along with other random events. Usually advertised on tables a few weeks prior to the event. \\n\\n\\n2. Non-sushi menu items. There is a good selection of pre-made bowls along with a make your own bowl option. I consider all of these bowls to be \\""""to-go\\"""" options, I can never finish a full bowl (I\'m 6\'3\\"""" and 200+ lbs, to give you an idea of my size/appetite). Also, the buffalo burger and salmon entrees are good sized and won\'t break the bank.\\n\\nI\'ve had every appetizer available on the menu and can say that they are all good to excellent. The spring rolls come with a wonderful sweet sauce. The chicken quesadillas are large and filling. The asian nachos are piled high.\\n\\n\\n3. Desert - The \\""""Mojos\\"""" are probably one of the best frozen deserts I\'ve ever had. Ice cream wrapped in rice crispy treats. The ice cream can change daily, the servers usually do not know what flavor it will be. The menu states this as well.\\n\\n\\n4. The \\""""Underground\\"""" menu. This is the menu of specialty rolls that are made. These clock in at $12 each and are very good. The Jalapenko is spicy and very filling for an 8 piece serving. \\n\\n\\n5. The \\""""all you can eat\\"""" on Saturday. This is both good and bad. The good is that yes, you can get all you can eat (of the available sushi, not everything is on this special). The bad is that once it gets busy you will need to wait for your items, Moto runs two sushi chefs max. If you expect 20 orders of 5+ sushi items to come out in 5-10 minutes, you need to come back to reality. Get there early and order in a timely manner, be prepared.\\n\\n\\nAnd now the downside:\\n\\n1. Sushi - The regular menu has, in comparison to other sushi bars, a very small selection. As mentioned in earlier reviews, only smoked salmon for some items rather than regular salmon. The sushi available is of good size without the \\""""rice bloat\\"""" that some sushi bars have, you know what I mean, when the roll has more rice than contents (fish/veggies/seaweed or soy wrap). I recommend ordering a regular roll, such as spicy tuna and an \\""""underground\\"""" roll (mentioned above).\\n\\n\\n2. Wait time and servers - This is a neighborhood restaurant, through and through this is how the owner markets the establishment and runs it. If it is very busy you will need to wait for a table. You will need to wait for your order to be prepared longer if it is busy.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\'s all I have to offer you in the way of advice and opinion on Moto. Overall it is above average when factoring in the experience and goal of the restaurant. I wouldn\'t call it a \\""""sushi experience\\"""", but rather a nice sushi restaurant in a good neighborhood. Go to have a nice lunch or dinner, or to watch a game and drink some great beers."""""""\n'

aS"We Finlay made it to St Francis. My girlfriend and I came here for dinner New Years eve for dinner before heading to a party. We both went with the 3 course meal that night. She got the salad that had thinly slice grapefruit and a light but tasty vinaigrette. I choose the lobster bisque. This lobster bisque was so good except one thing, they put thinly sliced pecans in it. This is not a place for nuts. I had a few bites of it before I got the pecans and it was delicious. Once i chewed the nuts it coated my mouth and that was all I could taste for the rest of the bowl. Leave the nuts out next time it was so good!!! Course #2 She got the scallops. Freakin awsome and cooked to perfection! I have never had a scallop cook so perfect ever. Props to who ever was cooking the scallops that night! I ordered the fillet. I ordered it med rare and it was more like med+ and I took one bite and decided to keep it cause it was delicious and they were busy and didn't want to wait 15 min for another. I usually would have sent it back but the flavor was there and the veggies that came with were excellent. For the desserts she got pear dessert with ice cream. Freakin awsome. Great thing to have for cleansing the palate after all that great food. I got the Chocolate turtle dessert that was great but we took that home for later. The building is cool and for the firs timers the waiter gives you a little history about the building before ordering. Great service and great food. We will be back and cant wait to see whats on the menu next time we stop by!\n"

The locals that frequent the place are definitely life of the party. The dog wall of fame is very sweet. The RIP wall made me tear up for my recently lost dog. When you're in this joint, you feel dinstinctly like you're in a beach town in San Diego, rather than a tiny suburb in AZ. \\n\\nI recommend you swing by.

aS"Oh...my...lanta! I can't believe I haven't visited this little gem sooner! It's nestled atop a Pei Wei and Starbucks so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But from the moment I walked up the dimly light stairway and into the bar, I knew it was going to be a great night.  So first off, they open at 4 and happy hour is until 7pm.  (20% off everything on Sundays!!). They have a huge selection of different booze and brews and their specialty cocktails are definitely something that sets them apart from other bars.  I loves me some Moscow Mule, so when I saw that they had one on the menu (in a real copper mug!!) I ordered one immediately.  It was so tastilicious that I had to order a second.  For my next drink, I tried the Retro Cooler, which in my opinion, is as cool as it gets...think Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused.  It's a mix of St. Germaine (Elderflower liquer) with Champagne and a lemon twist.  It went down the ole' hatch super easy, though, so be careful!  The second time I enjoyed this bar I ordered the White Rabbit (no...it's not vegan and they don't have a milk substitute...I cheated!)  It has Godiva White Chocolate liquer, horchata, stoli vanilla and some other yumness.  This one tasted like candy and I drank it in about five seconds.  Anyway, besides the drinks, they also have a few light snacks like hummus, artichoke dip, etc.  The vibe in this place is super chill and I really dig the way the bar is set up; the backdrop has big circle cutouts with yellow lights behind. There are comfy couches and high top tables and of course seats at the bar.  I almost felt like I was going to see Shane and Alice from the L Word walk in.  On our last visit, it was pretty busy as it was a holiday weekend and there was a dj.  The people of SideBar definitely know what they're doing and I will certainly be back!\n"

aS"Love this place!\\n\\nI'm vegetarian, but my friends and family aren't. It's great that True Food has plenty of options for both, plus those who are gluten free. I highly recommend the TLT sandwich (tempeh, lettuce, tomato) with sweet potato hash or the hummus plate. The hummus plate is enough for your main meal or to be shared with 2-4 people.\\n\\nThe pricing is decent--it's what you're going to pay anywhere else in Scottsdale. The only time I had an issue with the service was when they first opened and had snobby hostesses, but I haven't had that problem again. The weekend wait at night can get annoying, but at least they offer free wifi to pass the time.\n"

Try something off the secret menu.  3x3, 4x4, animal style, well done fries... grilled cheese! yup!\\n\\nThe service is always good, the restaurants are always clean, and the food is always fresh.

aS"WOW!  This is a beautiful Spring Training stadium!  I was able to attend the Season Opener of the D-backs and Rockies and loved this place. It did take what seemed forever to get a parking and I am sure that they have worked out the kinks.  The lawn seating covers the entire outfield and is the best place to watch a game.  The food was fantastic!  There were so many choices.  I decided to go with some fry bread and I was not disappointed.  My next visit I will have to try out Salty's or Native New Yorker.  I did get to spy on a celebrity...Gonzo was signing some autographs for some lucky fans!  I loved the selections of micro brews that are available at the stadium.  I like that this stadium has sunblock stands available courtesy of CHC.   I can't wait to watch several more games at this stadium during spring training!\n"

aS'A perfect way to top of an exotic shopping experience at 99 Ranch.  The Taiwan Express has photos of many (not all) of their dishes. Very authentic.  \\n\\nAlso try some shaved ice for desert (brought me back to Singapore!).  My kids love the shaved ice, though they are more used to Asian foods than most kids.  \\n\\nNote that the Buffet section (to the left) is better than any mall food courts, and may be more tame for some taste buds.  \\n\\nAND - in between the buffet and Taiwan Express you can buy a whole roast duck for about $12.50, which they will cut up for you.  Be sure to buy some Plum Sauce (elsewhere in the store) for a sweet dipping sauce for the duck (yummy!).\n'

I think there is 11 jewelry stores in the airport alone, which would suck if it were anywhere else, but when your in Arizona your in the Mecca of awesome craft jewelry masters from all the local Native American tribes.

It was especially nice when they felt the need to complain about their miserable lives to the customers. But ya know, I learned something from one of them one day. It sounds to me it was the owner or manager of this location that was the bane of these poor girls' existence. So ya know what, I'm on their side now. \\n\\nBut that used to be the trend.

We came during dinner (around 630PM) and the place was packed but everyone was friendly and so was the service.\\n\\nWe ordered 4 different bruschettas. I was originally intending on ordering a panini, but one of my sorority sisters suggested otherwise.

So much that we ordered another 4 with our 2 favorites. Can't go wrong... just pick one!

This is where I think CDT has an opportunity to improve.  They have a limited menu and since they are a French restaurant, they should think about offering some of the more updated French dishes.  A stereotypical French meal is heavy in saturated fats; heavy creams and butter which are staples in many French dishes and what CDT offers is no different.  Think about offering some of the newer French style dishes that include crepes, more game meats and sea food dishes.\\n\\nAppetizer~ their delicious three onion Tart and it was excellent!

Rooms were outfitted very nicely, they were fancy -- but not so outdone that you felt out of place. \\n\\nWent with a friend and the two sinks in the room were an excellent bonus. Each evening spent sitting outside, enjoying a bit of wine and the warm Arizona air. Beds were exquisite, rooms were quiet and just enough luxury to make you feel pampered without being overwhelmed by staff or extra charges for amenities.\\n\\nWe got a room close to the pool, and although a bit nippy in the evenings to go swimming -- it was a short shuffle away from the large hot tub which was excellent (except for the drunk couple that decided to turn it into their personal boudoir...)\\n\\nSpa - 3.5 Stars:\\n\\nI have mixed feelings about the spa. First issue was when I was trying to make my appointment and the front desk did not seem very knowledgeable about the services they offered (for skin types, etc.) Then, upon arriving we received a tour of the facilities which was not very personable and seemed so rehearsed. (Also, I think I can find the bathroom and the towels, and I also know how to open up a locker....the tour turned into 15 minutes of me not being able to be in the Jacuzzi.)\\n\\nIt seems that they schedule everyone at the same time for their services...because before I knew it the calm waiting room had turned into a packed holding cell for half the women of Scottsdale. One by one, they called the clients into their services...but it just felt a tad awkward. \\n\\nMy massage was EXCELLENT. The masseuse was extremely good, probably one of the best I've had and really enjoyed it. I'm not particularly shy, so it's easy for me to relax pretty quickly when getting a massage. Afterwards, had a facial and the Asthetician was also quite good -- my face was glowing for two days afterwards. I REALLY appreciated that she didn't try to sell me on the products she used, which after a relaxing facial -- the last thing I was is you trying to hawk your $50 face cream in a tube the size of lip gloss.\n"

aS"A coffee shop is good when...\\n\\n1. they serve delicious caffeinated beverages \\n2. they offer tasty treats to soothe your hunger pains\\n3. they provide sufficient room to get work done. \\n\\nRoyal at the Market offers all three. The coffee is creamy, and full of a caffeinated kick which is the perfect boost to the day. I like iced coffee and enjoy their iced latte here. They have plenty of pastries to munch on and more important, the Downtown Public Market is just a step through a pair of doors. Finally, they have plenty of seating where it's easy to get work done. They have community tables as well as individual high tops. They also have a back room with seating as well.  \\n\\nBetween the Market and Royal at the Market, this is an ideal spot to visit for a beverage and to do some work and I like to visit as often as I can.\n"

aS"I love it! The diviest piece of crap hole in the wall, but they make the best food! The sweet and sour pork is actually chopped pork, with a heavy breading and cooked just right. So much better than the standard deep fried pork balls at other places. The egg rolls aren't actually wrapped, but they dip them batter and fry them without any wrapping. The soups are great, and the family dinners which come with soup, egg roll, and entree are a great value. The servers are pretty old chinese women that will not bend for anything... at all. We orderd a meal for two, and then asked to order a third one and she refused, saying they already started cooking it, and we would have to order another meal for two... odd. Also odd, is they have a birdcage with a fake cardinal in the center of the dining room. This is so far the best chinese I have found in Phoenix, a city that should be known for having no good chinese restaurants.\n"

Sadly I do realize we have to put up with the uneducated from time to time but that was a bit much. \\n\\nOk, on to the food. This was the first time I have been to Capt Bills and did not have any idea of what to expect. I did check out the reviews on Yelp and they looked pretty good. I have driving by this place for years  and never stopped in so I figured why not. \\n   When I first walked in I liked the look of the place. Lots of wood and it felt like an old school joint. I walked up to order and was greeted by a rather attractive young lady and thats always a good way to start things. I ordered the 10 inch Italian and 2 10 inch pastrami subs. Price was not to bad overall. The Italian sub is dirt damn cheap for what you get. I did order to go so I picked it up and went on home to try out this new (to me) place. \\n   I took a bite of the Italian first and was amazed at how good it was. Lots of flavor with a nice fresh taste. Excellent bread with good cheese. This is a winner in my book. I will be back for the Italian. \\n    I then reached over and took a bite of the pastrami and again was shocked at how good it was. This is not the type of pastrami you find at places like Chompies but a bit more like lunch meat. It was however very good with no gristle at all. Great flavor and very good cheese. Another winner for me. I am now starting to think about trying more and more of what Capt Bills has to offer. \\n    All in all Capt Bills gets high marks for the food but a big negative for the political B.S. on the walls. I will be back for the food but I will never start a chat about politics in this place.\n"

I did pass on a dish that featured tripe.  Sorry.  Maybe I wasn't ready to go all the way.\\n\\nThe review trend has risen over the last few months.  I think I heard there was a change in ownership or management or possibly a new chef.  Or all of the above.

There is a papier mache sculpture exhibit by a Tucson artist that is veryyyyyy spooky.  There are dresses made from newspaper and the yellow pages.  There are lithographs of pop art you may recognize.  \\n\\nI liked that the museum houses a good balance of fine art and modern art.  I am not too keen on pop art, but DD is.  Her favorite piece in the whole museum was \\The Artist who Swallowed the World,\\"""" by Erwin Wurm.  She couldn\'t stop talking about it and remembered it by name.  She made sure to ask me what each piece was named, though sometimes she would dart to the next piece before hearing the answer.\\n\\nMy favorites were mostly in the fine art area.  I especially loved looking at all the old portraits.  Sometimes I felt as if they were alive.  If only the movie Night at The Museum was nonfiction!  But, seriously, the old masters really had a gift for painting their subject\'s gaze.  Fascinating!\\n\\nI also loved seeing the old bathing suits from the 20s and 50s and the old Naval uniforms.  I would LOVE to have a vintage bathing suit.  In fact, I might scour Etsy for one now!\\n\\nWe both loved the museum, even though I would have preferred to spend more time there.

The Carne asada was my least favorite.   The Chile Rellano was very nice.  The  Bakery Items that I enjoyed were the Bread Pudding, not the american style but a buttery Bar/Cake style and the sweet Potatoe filled Empanada which was a sweat soft  bread filled with autumn flavored sweet potatoes.  I will return for the Tripas Taco, Chille Rellano and the Bread pudding without a doubt.   The prices are very reasonable and there is plenty of parking in this Market style Order and wait business.

aS"I love this place so much I would love to move to the area and volunteer. I came here to get my therapy pet which happens to be a guinea pig named Clark and while we were there we could not resist a rat named ratatouille so we snatched her up as well. I could not help but take forever looking at all of the darling pets and feel so sad that I could not take all of them home with me. The employees are very much as in love with pets as I am and you can tell that each and every one of them is an avid animal lover and not just some person who is working there because it's a job to them. \\n\\nThe person who helped us let us take our time petting each pig and getting a feel for each animal. He even played with the rat for what seemed like an extended amount of time. Don't expect to waltz in here and waltz on out of here in 15 minutes, you really want to make sure you feel a connection to the animal so just sit there and play and hold the animal. The employees will tell you all you need to know about the animal's history and demeanor. Plus they want to make sure that they are going to suitable homes so you will need to fill out an application and if you live in apartments make sure you go and adopt while your apartment complex office is open because they will need to call and make sure that you are allowed to have pets in your complex, no exceptions.\\n\\nThe staff is so friendly and we were even able to purchase an extra cage for $12! If you know small animal cages you recognize that this is a steal for a new, moderate sized animal cage. The facilities are very nice for an adoption center, there is a gift shop for your new pet so you can pick up beautiful collars and pet dishes ect. I think you even get a discount when you adopt a pet. Each animal has their own section and there are rooms where they will put in in with the pet and play with them. As I was leaving I couldn't help myself and took Clark out at the car so I could cuddle him, an employee was going home and stopped and chatted with me and was very nice as she was happy to see Clark going home. I also like that they provide you with a free vet exam and expenses paid (if needed) up to $500 for any conditions the pet might have although they are thoroughly taken care of at the shelter. The appointment just needs to be made within 5 days at any VCA hospital that they will give you a flyer for in your adoption packet. I will be back here again.\n"

Beautiful, classy, iconic...this is a place to go for special occasions. Where *every* table is a good table to have a fantastic view of the entire city skyline while you slowly rotate around with good company. There are little plaques telling you what you are viewing throughout the time, which is neat.\\n\\nWe came around 9pm on week night during the holidays so it was fairly quiet and slightly atypical in social atmosphere, I imagine.

They were out of a few of the sides, but at the end of the day my meal was spectacular!!!! I went with the brisket sandwich with a side of seasonal vegetables. Now these weren't any regular vegetables, they actually cooked them in the smoker!! It was zucchini, mushrooms and peppers. Super great, perfectly cooked! My brisket sandwich was one of, if not, the best BBQ sandwich I've ever had period! The bark on the brisket was spectacular, nice spicy dry rub on the meat. The brisket itself was super tender and had that killer beef flavor you expect from a slow cooked brisket. The bbq sauce was a bit strange, but was pretty good. The sandwich didn't need it at all, super killer sandwich. Overall there were some minor things I'd change but hey, they're a new restaurant!!! Killer BBQ spot on Central Phoenix. Way to go guys!!!

aS'"""Fattoush (pronounced \\Fuh-too-shh\\"""") is essentially one of those hole in the wall, ethnic mom-and-pop dives people always yearn for when craving something a little more authentic. After several consistent recommendations from friends, well, I finally gave in to pressure.\\n\\nFirst off, it is not in a \\""""sketchy location,\\"""" really. No more \\""""sketchy\\"""" than many pockets throughout central Phoenix. So it\'s not Chandler or Surprise? Get over it. I rather relish any hints of urban grit. It\'s called living in a real city.\\n\\nThe interior is unremarkable, there is no atmosphere, however, it\'s clean. After seating yourself, someone brings you a menu. After eating at Fattoush on just a few repeat occasions, you will quickly become familiar with everyone who works there, and who knows, ended up addressing many of them on a first-name basis.\\n\\nMinus the few noticeable, more Mediterranean and pedestrian items (read: the Greek salad), Fattoush, for the most part, serves noticeably authentic food. In fact, it\'s probably one of the most genuine Middle-Eastern establishments you\'ll find in Phoenix. From their baba ghanoush and falafel to their tabouli and lamb kebabs, the food tastes fresh, and frankly, like it should.\\n\\nNothing on the menu is priced unreasonably. In fact, it\'s fairly cheap. Serving such good food, I\'d be willing to pay a lot more. The service is never overbearing. If you go expecting someone to be circling your table every few minutes, asking if everything is alright, if you wanted another drink, etc., you will be disappointed. This is not Pita Jungle or the Cheesecake Factory, and, thank god for that.\\n\\nI probably eat there now two or three times a month, and it\'s consistency comforting. If you truly love Middle Eastern food beyond hummus and lentil soup, you will truly love Fattoush. It would be worth a visit. \\n\\nI am truly glad I discovered it."""""""\n'

After issuing my personal litmus test for any new coffee place I try out: the Americano, I am asked for my punch card. \\Punch... card?\\"""" I ask quizzically. I explain that this is my first visit to their fine establishment. Buy 10 and get 1 free.  At first I was hesitant to try a coffee place not adorned by a topless half-fish/half-woman person but now, I see that they have something that that other place doesn\'t offer. Customer loyalty apparently has a reward in this universe! I order the largest Americano they serve (a \\""""large\\"""" they call it) and eventually it cools to less than 200 degrees, allowing me to finally enjoy it without risk of 3rd degree face burns. The coffee is flavorful and rich and I finish it quickly. Other items on the menu include your standard lattes and mochas, but another item not on that other place\'s menu: gelato. I decide to reserve that treat for a future visit. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is not unlike that of your friendly neighborhood Pizza Hut. I don\'t mean this negatively. I mean... who doesn\'t love place mats you can color?? Yet, there seems to be the lingering vibe that this building used to be a part of said pizza conglomerate. There is a large, rectangular table in the middle of the shop surrounded by tables and the occasional love seat. The only thing I find fault with is their choice of chairs around some of the tables. They are plastic and not unlike something you\'d find in Cousin Eddie\'s backyard. If you can secure an upholstered seat, then this becomes a non-issue. \\n\\nFor those of you with portable computer machines (a \\""""laptop\\"""" is what they call it) you can surf the \'net with ease.

Enjoying bite after satisfying bite, my morning craving was quickly becoming fulfilled like an ancient prophecy. Ordering a side of Russian dressing to dunk my fries into may sound slightly odd but after one dip I think you'll agree, its perfectly natural.\\n\\nFor the health conscious who are rolling their eyes at my delicious choices, Scott's does offer lighter fare such as salads, soup and half sandwiches. However, I for one don't go to Scott's to eat light, I go to Scott's eat well.\n"

aS"Liquor? Good!\\n\\nIce cream? Better!\\n\\nLiquor and ice cream TOGETHER? THE BEST!\\n\\nMy hubby, cousin and I were in the middle of our road trip and were on our way out of Scottsdale to get to New Mexico. But when I saw this place pop up on my Yelp app, we made a U-turn from getting onto the freeway.\\n\\nThis store is located in a really nice and cute part of town. I could totally spend my afternoons walking around.\\n\\nI tried pretty much all the flavors there. Vodka Orange Cream was one of my favorites. It totally tastes like an orange creamsicle with a kick of vodka. My absolute favorite was Long Island Butterscotch. It was super strong like a real Long Island. It was just enough to get the flavor. And it was accompanied by little nuggets of butterscotch goodness. \\n\\nThere are only about 15 - 20 alcoholic and non-alcoholic flavors out at a time, but the owner (who is a friendly lady) has tons of flavors that cycle. You can see the complete list of flavors on their website. \\n\\nBy the way, make sure you have your ID! Or else you'll be stuck with the kiddie flavors. The non-alcoholic flavors are good, but just not as fun. =) This place is a perfect finish to a night out with your friends!\n"

aS"I've been coming to Fair Trade Cafe ever since my move back to Phoenix in 2010 when I was living on Portland.  I met a friend here for coffee, at his suggestion, and have been coming here ever since.\\n\\nFor awhile, I spent three nights a week here either meeting about my book or writing it.  It was such a relaxed atmosphere and the employees were the nicest coffee shop employees in town.  \\n\\nSince moving to Ahwatukee, I have not had much occasion to visit the cafe.  Recently, I have been downtown more frequently.  I've popped in three times in the last week just to read.  \\n\\nThey now have the rewards terminal for Belly next to their register, which I've seen popping up at small businesses in town.  They have bigger tables.  They have gotten rid of their retail offerings (apparently they were collecting too much dust).  Their pastry case has been removed.  \\n\\nBut other than those basic changes, Fair Trade Cafe is essentially the same.  It is a great local cafe where you can get basic eats (today I had an egg and cheese croissant) and good drinks at a fair price.  And you can feel good doing it, too.  They support fair trade practices.  \\n\\nI've tried a few other local coffee shops in town and they're just not for me.  The vibe here at Fair Trade is relaxed.  I feel comfortable sipping on my soy hot cocoa or Italian soda at my own pace as I read a book.  I don't feel rushed.  I feel only the utmost relaxation.  \\n\\nIf you're working on a project, having a quick meeting, writing a paper (or a book) or just want a place to pop in to get away from the hustle and bustle for awhile, Fair Trade Cafe should be your place.\\n\\nThis place reminds me so much of SF Bay Area cafes.  It's just like home!\\n\\nA side note: One of the owners, Stephanie, is one of the nicest people in Phoenix.  She is such a genuine person and I really wish her every success in growing her business.\n"

Great way to taste some brews before you stop by the specialty shop and spend $10-20 on a bottle.  Food is very very good - but make no mistake, this is an alehouse, not a restaurant, so the menu is small.

aS"STAY HERE! - Truly a hidden gem!\\n\\nIn an age where service is gone, personality has been lost, and most everything is either overpriced, disappointing, or corporate and cold, FIRESKY is unlike anyplace else. Is it absolutely perfect? No, but it is almost perfect. Do they strive for perfection in a very sincere and personal way?- yes!\\n\\nThis is truly one of the best stays you could imagine - in Scottsdale or otherwise. The staff is friendly, and anything that might go wrong is addressed immediately. The management is seriously killer. They are in it to win it, and clearly they are establishing a reputation as truly personal, service oriented, while creating an intangible positivity and sense of well-being having to do with the actual human interaction that radiates through the place. You won't want to leave. Can you actually be homesick for a hotel? Yep. \\n\\nSpecifics- the afternoon gratis wine is a nice touch, and encourages guests to convene late in the afternoon.. Met some nice folks while getting our glasses filled. The pool areas are fantastic.. The small sand 'beach' is addictive- it's like playing in a Zen rock garden in the water. We had some local friends stop by for cocktails in the lobby bar- they brought their kids so the Wii in the lobby was heaven sent. The loungers and cabanas are appointed very well, with fantastic pillows and such. I could go on and on. But you will love the people of Firesky as much as the place itself. If you are a stuffed shirt, who demands a cookie cutter, corporate polish, stay elsewhere. If you want to feel good, really good, stay here.

I\'ve always loved steamed and lightly grilled dumplings, yet 99% of the time restaurants use super thick, gummy wrappings and also charge $7-8 bucks -- Cherryblossom uses the thinnest wrappers I\'ve ever seen, and charge about half the going rate; they\'re absolutely first class, like everything they serve.\\n\\nOne may think it\'s kinda odd for what appears to be an Asian cafe serving Thai as well as sushi, as well as ITALIAN dishes too -- I sure scratched my head on that one!  BUT, it\'s like the staff says: \\we serve these different dishes with our own Japanese flair\\"""".  How true.  I love Pad Thai, yet their way of making it is no different than how many households make their own versions of things like meatloaf... There\'s always an abundance of meat, tofu (that\'s fried prior to tossing it in) and things like snap peas, yielding one of the best \\""""non Thai\\"""" versions I\'ve ever had.  I\'ve tried over a dozen of their dishes, and all I can say is I\'ve never not enjoyed anything they\'ve made for me to date.  I\'ve yet to cross the proverbial line and order an Italian noodle/pasta dish, but that\'s only because in my being of Scicillian decent, I NEVER go out for Italian, simply because there\'s few that will ever compare to what my family made for us.\\n\\nAnd, the entire staff is as great as the food they serve, and the whole place speaks to quality, from cleanliness to the ambiance.  I truly believe that if you don\'t like the CherryBlossom, you\'re probably the type of person who can find fault with just about any restaurant.\\n\\nThey also always have loaves of blueberry banana bread for sale in the waiting area, and almost always they\'re still warm from the oven.

Tim really takes the time to explain everything in language you understand and is quick to do what he can to accomidate you.

I should give it zero stars for the number of times I\'ve been subjected to \\""""honey, I need to go shopping.\\"""" And don\'t get me wrong, the first couple of times I found somewhere to camp out on the floor and settled into a good pout.\\n\\nThen, I think on the third or so forced Bataan death march to Nordstroms by the shopping slave master general that I live with, I found myself off of my ass, putting my phone in my pocket, and walking around trying not to be seduced by Nordstrom\'s very reasonably priced wares. \\n\\nSo here\'s the short and sweet of it, if you\'re a dude/bro/dirt ball like myself, and you are lucky enough to have someone who likes you enough to take you out in public, you might as well enjoy yourself, maybe even let your significant other show you what to buy so you\'re socially acceptable when you meet her friends/family/co-workers/fellow dog nuts/colleagues/people she\'ll claim you as hers/his in front of them.

aS"I love this little pub. I love it for it's location / proximity to the ballpark and within walking distance to other establishments. I love this place for it's quaint-ness and the fact that as soon as you walk like 4 feet through the doorway, you can order a beverage. I love this place for the simple fact that it was one of the first bars/pubs I went to with friends when I first moved here (insert nostalgia). I love the beer selection (local brew on tap) + half off burger Mondays + $3 breakfasts after 10 on Sunday (also bloody marys and mimosas for the same price).\\n\\nMy only complaint is directed at myself for not being available to go to the Rose and Crown every Sunday morning!!\n"

I'm more of a let's-get-drunk-and-observe-people kind of nerd, so naturally I went to the bar first. $5 pints are a steal when it's Saturday night and you can drink New Belgium Somersault like water. I didn't get mixed drinks, because fuck the mixed drinks when you've got this tap selection at this price in this cool of a club. \\n\\nSeveral pints deep, I wandered away to the patio. Not bad at all--you get another bar, groovy furniture, and an amazing view. Hell, you can light one up if you fancy a smoke.

aS"I've had the privilege of flying into PHX on one blissful weekend to run the 2011 P.F. Chang Rock n Roll Arizona marathon. Finding that cheap airline ticket from HNL was the challenge in itself, but it was totally worth it. PHX is about a 10 minute drive from downtown Phoenix, so it wasn't too bad, although they also have a public transportation that's pretty noteworthy too. Using Delta Airlines as my prime carrier of choice, I connected through Salt Lake City, before boarding the small regional jet to PHX. There were some direct flights to PHX, but it was on US Airways, an airline I don't know much about, or do I really want to fly with anyways. I stick with what works and makes me happy.\\n\\nPHX itself is a regional airport, but is large enough to support a large flux of commuters and travelers getting into Phoenix and other destinations within the surrounding region or across the USA, if not farther than that. There is not much in the way of shopping here, unless you were to do the usual snacks, restaurants, and other pickups of souvenirs you want to snag at the airport before leaving for your final destination.  Getting in and out of this airport is similar to other sized airports, just go to follow the directional arrows to the baggage claim and pick up your luggage before heading to the rental car counter or shuttle, taxi cab area, or the waiting area for your friends and family. \\n\\nI definitely love PHX and the city of Phoenix and Tempe. Just like most airports, the ticketing area is very much together, unless mentioned otherwise. I do love the airline DIY kiosks, since I know I can do it myself without having to do much of anything. I normally just check in on my iPhone and print out the paper boarding pass at the airport. Sometimes, I should just use my iPhone app to go through security, just to save a little bit of time. Then again, I do like to keep those boarding pass mementos of 1st class seating, just because it's just an awesome feeling to be in 1st class rather than in economy. For now, economy works right now, since airline tickets are getting to be a pain. There is free wifi connectivity here at the airport, so that's a good thing when you need it. \\n\\nThe baggage claim area at PHX is smaller than I thought, but it's pretty good. The only problem would be that airport prices for food and amenities do cost an arm and a leg. That's the crappy part of the entire flying experience for me. While I know they have to make money somehow, try to find some other way to gauge the flying public, please! I know I shouldn't really grumble about it, but I'm blessed to be flying when all I am doing is running marathons in every state in the United States. I probably won't come back to PHX in the future. If I do, it will just be passing through to other destinations still undiscovered by me.\\n\\nFly away!\\n\\nB+\n"

I\'ll be honest, the yogurt itself doesn\'t stand out at any particular yogurt place, but there are a few differences that I think make Yogurt Builderz my top choice. \\n\\n1. Flavor Availability - YB offers 10 flavors at all times and typically keeps all the really popular ones (Oreo  and  Oatmeal Cookie) in the rotation consistently.  \\n\\n2. Freeze factor - yes, I said it.  At some shops, the yogurt is too melted, others it\'s too frozen.  YB\'s consistency is usually great!\\n\\n3. Neighborhood hangout - YB has created more than a yogurt shop,  people want to be there to hang out with their family and friends.

It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I\'d like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, \\Well, they\'re all fresh-frozen.\\"""" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they\'re fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil\'s philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream."""""""\n'

aS'Went to Cafe Bink for lunch on Saturday, and it was one of the best lunches I have had in a long time!  We had a bottle of chanpagne and a sandwich each.  My friend had the White cheddar grilled cheese and I had the Corned Beef sandwich.  His grilled cheese was full of flavor and I cannot tell you how great my corned beef was....We also had the french fries which have to be the best french fries I have ever had!  They are cooked 3 times before arriving at your table and served with three dipping sauces.  With our lunch we split a bottle of Baumard which was perfect with both sandwiches.  Also, the service was great.  Highly recommend Cafe Bink!\n'

aS"My son bought a remote control car online and immediately broke it. Since it was under warranty, we sent it to the manufacturer for repair. They fixed it, but it took MONTHS. He got it back and immediately broke it again. We sent it back to the manufacturer, and they sat on it for MONTHS. When they did send it back, it was out of warranty. He immediately broke it yet AGAIN. We couldn't send it back to the manufacturer so it sat in his closet for over a year, a sad testament against the 'unbreakable' and 'manufacturer's warranty' claimed when we bought his RC car. \\n\\nRecently, my wife took my son and the broken car down to Hobby Bench. She did have the owner's manual, which made things easier. The guy in the back diagnosed the issue right away. He told my wife which part to purchase. After purchase, the part was installed right on the spot. As in IMMEDIATELY!\\n\\nIt's been a week or two since then. My son has been having a real blast with his RC car. I know it's just a matter of time before he breaks it again. But I know that when that happens, we can take it down to Hobby Bench to fix it. No expensive shipping. No waiting MONTHS for the car to ship there and back. \\n\\nMy hats off to Hobby Bench for taking care of my wife and son, and fixing the issue so quickly!\n"

aS'"""My husband and I decided to visit the Joya Spa for Spa Week this year, and are we ever glad we did.  This place is an absolute dream!  \\n\\nUnfortunately, we were running late for our appointment, due to unforeseen construction on the roads, and I was STRESSED. However, whatever stress I had bottled up inside of me instantly disappeared once we stepped inside the Joya. The staff was extremely accommodating, and explained they just learned about the traffic delay earlier that morning, and all appointment times would be honored for the full length of the service.  Normally, spas will deduct time off your treatment to keep on schedule if you\'re late, so I was very happy to hear this.  Five minutes after checking in, I whipped my clothes off, threw them (literally) into a locker, and dashed out to my couples massage. \\n\\nWe were in a large suite off the terrace, and were immediately set at ease wtih a spritz of their signature scent at the spa to invigorate our senses.  Our massage therapists were wonderful.  They were extremely attentive, and sensitive to the pressure they were applying. By the time it was over, my husband had to pry me off the table because I didn\'t want to move.  I was officially jello.  This was by far, one of the best massages I\'ve had in a long time.  Upon leaving the treatment room, we were greeted with glasses of champagne to wish us a happy anniversary.  I had casually mentioned this to the designer on the phone when I booked the appointments, so I was extremely impressed with their attention to detail.  \\n\\nThey led us to the co-ed lounge, which looked more like a Moroccan hideaway.  The lounge was incredibly relaxing that it almost put me to sleep, which wouldn\'t have been a bad thing considering the state I was in. \\n\\nAfter having a little alone time to bask in our new centered states, we decided to hang pool side.  \\Wow\\"""" is all I can say!  You walk out to this picturesque view of the mountain--truly a divine oasis.  My one qualm with the pool area, was its size.  There were definitely not enough seats for the amount of clientele they had on site that day, and you could tell people were getting frustrated.  Also, we ordered some spa fare poolside, and for two salads, a forty dollar bill was a bit much.  But, hey, we\'re at a resort in Paradise Valley, so what did we expect?!?\\n\\nWe finished off our day with a quick workout, dunk in the whirlpool, and sweating out the toxins in the steam room and sauna.  I even tried the cold deluge, which is basically is a cold shower.  Even after the steam rooms, its still freezing, but helps bring your body temperature down pretty quickly.\\n\\nOverall, my experience was magnificent. The staff was very pleasant, helpful, and prompt.  There was always an abundance of fresh towels, all rooms, showers, and lockers were turned over and cleaned quickly, and water/ice tea and fruit spreads were always stocked and fresh.  My husband and I couldn\'t have asked for a better experience. We will DEFINITELY be returning!"""""""\n'

aS'I have never had REAL ramen until I came here.

The servings are absolutely huge, but fantastic.  \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I tried this place out on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. It was quiet inside, but the cashier explained they just finished with their dinner rush.\\n\\nI ordered the miso ramen and my boyfriend got the curry rice with a side order of goyoza. There were three goyoza to an order, and to be honest, they were small for the price.  The miso ramen and the curry rice were both very good. \\n\\nWe went there a week later (due to a hankering of mine) and decided to share a bowl of the republic ramen along with edamame and veggie tempura. All of it was delish. \\n\\nThe only downside to the restaurant is that it smells like a grease fryer.

I was a regular at this place for a long time.  Occasionally though I'd forget to call ahead to reserve a table.  Even if the place was completely empty, without a reservation the host(ess) many times will become visibly annoyed and act as if it is a big deal to find you a table and then put you in a corner somewhere.\\n\\nI don't know if everyone feels that way, or if it was only a way to try to condition me to call ahead next time since they knew my face.\\n\\nOverall however, other than that, it is a decent place to go for the occasional grub.\n"

Man, good thing I had a horchata to cool the flames.  The horchata was very good but around halfway through it became nearly impossible to drink through the straw because of the fruit and nuts.

Sweet sweet aroma. It was nice to go down the salad bar and choose what ever toppings I wanted..plenty of variety and the whole boiled eggs are something that I haven't seen at other salad bars. Everything is really fresh, and is very similar to a sanwich shop back in CA (called Erik's deli) for those who know what I'm talking about. But sandwiches are a bit bigger here.

This place must be good.  Suprisingly, the wait was short...they obviously know how to handle a crowd at this place.  Once inside, I was impressed.  Pretty small, but we had plenty of room in our booth.  I ordered the eggs and sausage, which came with toast and potatoes. The food came out quick.

The Science Center is equivalent to some of finest science centers across the nation with their state of the art technology, interactive exhibits and activities for all ages. \\n\\nDuring past visits, I\'ve enjoyed traveling exhibits like the Titanic exhibit years ago. As you entered, they gave you a piece of paper with a name on it. As you walked through the exhibit you looked for the name and learned about who the person was. Then at the very end, there was a wall full of names and you got to see if the name they gave you survived or not. Even though I was a history major in college, I learned several new facts in this exhibit and it was extremely interactive and educational with fun mixed in! \\n\\nCurrently, they have an exhibit called \\""""Forces of Nature\\"""" where you can learn about different weather patterns, climates and how weather happens. In the middle of the exhibit you can walk up onto a stage-like area where you experience different weather patterns interactively.

I've had their pizza, sushi, and desserts as well and I can't say I'm ever disappointed.  \\n\\nIf you are looking for an authentic sushi experience, you won't find it here.  Most of the sushi is pretty mainstream.  But it you want to get a great meal and look at a ton of hotties, you can't beat it.  Go for happy hour!  Most cost effective and pretty generous.\n"

aS"Oh Scratch, you have my heart. I love your delicious fresh ingredients. Your mouth watering little desserts, and that coffee is to die for. Your customer service is always great. My only issue with you, I need to be rich to eat you :( Thats okay though, this is one local business I will be happy to support no matter what the price is. The bread is always fresh, nom nom nom. I love eating chicken that actually tastes like chicken! No overprocessed chicken here. This place is definitely worth trying out. My favorite thing to get here is a vanilla latte with soy milk, and the chicken/mozzarella/pesto/tomato sandwich.. it is quite possibly the best sammich I've ever tasted. And a bit of a warning, it can sometimes take awhile for your food but the wait is well worth it.\n"

aS"I don't think much more can be said that hasn't already been said about this place. Hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I was sad to move from the desert solely because I couldn't come here every week. \\n\\nThe bruschetta is amazing. Tomato jam is hands down my favorite...sounds weird, but extremely good. You really can't go wrong with any of them. If you go on Monday or Tuesday night after 8pm, a bottle of wine and board of this gloriousness is only $20 bucks. Get on that. If you're not in the mood for bruschetta, the Tuna Melt is out of this world...order it with a side of Sierra Nevada mustard and you won't go wrong. \\n\\nThe brunch here on the weekends is incredible, too. Central is the only one that offers it so don't try going to the other ones and ordering the BELT sandwich, because you won't get it....but come here and you'll experience the fantastic brunch\\n\\nFree valet, too.\n"

aS"If you like spring rolls, you have to go to Rice Paper. For those of you who don't know, spring rolls are the non deep-fried type, rather, they have fresh lettuce, mint, cilantro and such inside a rice paper shell. Think of it as a Vietnamese Burrito. At Rice Paper they have it set up almost like a sushi bar. You have your choice of about 20 different spring rolls (all priced under $4). You check what you want and they make it in front of you. The spring rolls come in all types from sushi grade tuna, to fried crab, to shrimp and vietnamese sausage. Each comes with a special dipping sauce catered to the roll. If you don't like spring rolls, I recommend the Bahn Mi, which is a Vietnamese sandwich that you'll never forget served with sweet potato fries. Or try the Pho noodle soup, or even (I can't believe I'm saying this since I hate salads) the salads are great. They make cocktails infused with lychee fruit like the Lycheejito (a twist on the mojito). You can't go wrong here, and the great thing is is that everything is so refreshing and healthy, you feel great afterwords, especially on a hot Phoenix summer day.\n"

aS'MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.\\n\\nThis is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos. \\n\\nThey have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.\\n\\nThe portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.\\n\\nThe tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.\\n\\nThe California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.\\n\\nThe restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.\\n\\nAnd if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)\\n\\nPS I think they are closed on Sundays\n'

Kevin said no problem  and  that we could pick it up Saturday, our anniversary was on Sunday  and  they're closed. We couldn't decide which flavor to chose so I told him to pick it for us. I also asked if it could just be covered in buttercream instead of fondant.\\n\\nThe top tier looked so cute! They chose the white cake infused with almond flavor with almond cream cheese  and  strawberry fillings  and  it was AMAZING! The random dots of fondant were a nice touch  and  the cake was so moist  and  delicious. Can't wait to get our 5th anniversary top tier!\n"

aS"Stumbled upon this place last night (during First Friday) and couldn't find a sign or the name until we saw a poster hanging inside. Cool house that was built in the 20's, with the DJ up top in the loft (music was great), lots of great art on the walls and the bar has been built into where the kitchen of the house was. \\n\\nThey were totally packed and coudn't even get out to the back but it was really fun. Everyone  was friendly and having fun. The website says they offer 80+ beers, we had Blue Moons and some others I'd never seen before (which is always cool!). Highly recommended, especially for First Friday- the artists selling their works, jewelry, handmade goods, purses, sunglasses and more are lined up down the street near the Lost Leaf, and you can walk a short distance to galleries and the AZ Center (great place to park if you don't get downtown early).\n"

aS"Great food, great service! I've never been a Vietnamese restaurant as clean as this one. We were seated promptly and our waiter even helped us with our order with recommendations and making slight changes to our items as we requested. We each had an order of spring rolls and a bowl of pho with drinks. The shrimp spring roll was delicious filled with lots and lots of veggies just the way I like it. My brisket pho was absolutely delicious. I don't like rare pho meat so I got the brisket and it was cooked well with the tenderness still intact. The Vietnamese iced coffee also perfect. Never had a coffee quite as good and creamy, even better than the powder packets that so many of my friends swear by. Love it!\n"

If you're into fragrance candles check out Indonesian Teak, Tahitian Vanilla and China Pear-basically their whole candle line is amazing. I also pick up ALL of my coffee here since they have unique and strong flavors such as Italian Roast. Every 6 bags of coffee purchased earns you a free one. :D  Cost Plus is even my go-to place for last-minute gifts like photo frames and wine. As a rewards member (sign up for free) I occasionally get emails advertising awesome specials in-store and online.

We sat outside in the lovely patio surrounded by bamboo and a crazy looking tiki in the corner that looked like he had been scared half to death.  Still, it was a nice relaxing setting.  Our server was very accomadting and immediatly brought to our attention that we had 20 more minutes left for Happy House.  SCORE!  Quickly we looked over the menu and she took our orders.  At $3 and $5 per dish the appetizers are a steal!!  Their signiture drinks are not Happy Hour prices but there is something for everyone on the menu.  One of my friends had the burger with sweet potato fries and said it was awesome.  The rock shrimp and crispy chicken skewers were very good too.  The prices here cannot be beat.

aS"There's a little bit of an island vibe going on right here in Arizona.\\n\\nThis casual place makes me smile.  Yes, it's just a step above a fast food place, but the vibe is tropical and the food is tasty and prepared fresh to order.   When you walk in, you'll notice the island music playing, the ceiling fans turning and some kitschy Hawaiian posters on the wall.  The air is filled with aromas of teriyaki, Jamaican jerk, island spice rubs.\\n\\nTake a look at the menu on the wall and then approach the counter to place your order.  You pay and they give you one of those big plastic numbers to place on your table so the food server can match you to your order.  While waiting (not long) you help yourself to the beverage station, sodas, water, and the specially prepared Mango Iced Tea, which is amazing.  I just can't get enough of that Mango Iced Tea.\\n\\nLooking around, it seems that most customers order the rice bowls.  You choose a meat (chicken, steak, shrimp, etc.) then pick a sauce flavor (teriyaki, Jamaican Jerk, Bali Island, Honey-orange), and then your choice of rice (white, brown, noodles).   Looks really good.  I typically order one of their big entr\\u00e9e salads.  I alternate between their Voodoo Chicken Salad and their Aloha Chicken Salad. I can't decide which one I like better.  My husband loves their Volcano-Blackened Mahi Mahi plate.  Where else can you get perfectly spiced Mahi topped with tropical fruit salsa, rice, and a salad for under $ 10?  Yum, tasty and a great value.\\n\\nIt's just a simple little place, but every time I eat here, it reminds me how much I love Hawaii and hope to return someday.  Until then...Aloha.\n"

aS"There are worse airports to be stuck in for 8 hours with a 102 degree fever and frequent bouts of  atomic diarrhea intermingled with seemingly eternal sessions of projectile vomiting (and this is only one quarter of the way through my travel itinerary) after a night of mostly the same and a day of trying to navigate the American Aviation system in the middle of the holiday rush. Perhaps some of you recall my last cross-country travel experience (3 days stuck at SFO waiting for a flight out...). This time was not much better. \\n\\nBut the airport staff at Phoenix made my excruciating delay that much better by providing me with tissues, sprite (for my tummy), tons of pillows, and enough blankets to warm my shivering, shaking, feverish body. Had I not convinced them I had food poisoning, they probably wouldn't have allowed me on the flight that I finally got on at 2 a.m. after boarding my first flight at 2 p.m. the day before and facing an additional 4 hour flight. Their assistance and support helped me get some much-needed sleep while awaiting my winged chariot and made the flight I finally got on much easier than my former flight had been.\\n\\nI might add that there were ample food and sundries stations in the terminal I was in and I easily found all the medication I cared to take and regurgitate. I have been in and out of this particular airport for various reasons over the years and always found it rather average until this past week. Thank you, Southwest employees and airport personnel for making yet another miserable travel experience so much easier to endure.\n"

This isn't greasy bad, like dripping and wet, this is good.  This is fluffy warm fry bread, with delicious spicy chorrizo, and all the fixings.\\nThe prices are good, the staff was friendly and quick, and the food? oh yes, I  will be back.\\nAlso, the leftovers with a fried egg cracked on top, a great breakfast the next morning.  really.\n"

Justin Y is dead on, it is by far the freshest sushi I've ever had, and I used to live 20 minutes from San Francisco! The rolls are fun inspired and unique. The seaweed isn't overpowering. The portions are perfect! Their lunch menu is awesome! 4 pcs Hamachi, 4 pcs Salmon, 1 philly roll, a daquari and edamame, 27.00 out the door.  Great value in my book, especially for something so fresh! The guys at the bar are men of few words, but they crank out quality! I'm still beside myself with joy!\n"

For the food, I'd say three stars.\\n\\nService was good though, and the dessert I had was great (Scharfenberger mousse).  \\n\\nAmbience was a bit loud, and not super cozy, but I may be a bit of a food snob since I'm so spoiled by some amazing food in the Bay Area so I just can't give this more than four stars.\n"

I love all the cheese... cheap eggs... organic carrot juice, greek yogurt, the pizzas are awsome, the bruschetta sauce, creamy tomatoe soup is TO DIE FOR.... frozen vegetables in a balsamic butter sauce, the white corn is mmmmmm, edamame, shelled pomegranate seeds, nuts, wasabi peas, fruit leather, wines (some really good ones for just $3!!!), non alcoholic mojito, great teas, ect ect ect.

We were promptly seated, and looked over the menu, settling on satay and littleneck clams to start with, then the mussaman and curry for entrees. The littleneck clams were very tasty, and the broth lively and sweet. The chicken for the satay was moist and tender, perfectly seasoned with a peanut sauce with a surprisingly light texture. I ordered my mussamon hot, but not Thai hot, and the spice gave me a workout. We finished it off with a mango mousse cake that had my wife and I fighting for the last bite. Nettie's service was friendly and warm, and definitely gave us a good reason to go back.\n"

Dukes is no exception.  \\n\\nI went to Dukes last Sunday for the Chargers game and it was packed.

From the entrance along the red carpet in the kitchen, to the velvet covered walls, high back red booths, and staff in tuxedos, you know you are in for a treat as soon as you walk in. Hell, even the line cooks will wave hi and bye to you. \\n\\nFeatured in the bar every afternoon is a killer happy hour, with half price domestic and well drinks. They typically draw a pretty good crowd that doesn't seem to let up until late in the evening. A lot of the clientele here is the well heeled group from Phoenix Country Club, Palmcroft, and other nicer neighborhoods. It's a diverse group from 20 somethings to the about to die blue hairs. \\n\\nThe honest truth, as others have said, is that you can find a better steak. I would barely put Durant's in the top 10 with stars like Donovan's, Mastro's, BLT, J and G, etc. But Durant's isn't all about the steak, it's about the experience, one every phoenician should encounter at least once in their lifetime. The owners aren't the least bit accommodating either, as they don't have to be. The restaurant fills up almost every night. \\n\\nI still maintain that if it weren't for Durant's, a lot of people wouldn't even know what Central Avenue in Midtown looks like.

We started with the Double Down (Hummus and Baba Ganoush). Pro: if you need extra pitas - and you will - they're free. Just ask. (Or maybe the bartender just gave them to us because we're cute girls?) Let's go with the former idea. We then also ordered The Trifecta, Crabmeat and Artichoke Dip, and Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken. Wow, we ordered a lot of food between the four of us. Well, my friends ordered them, I just ate them. But everything was really tasty. Note: the spicy-mayo that is served with an order of fries has got to have yellow curry in it. And it tastes FANTASTIC. \\n\\nThe bartender service was really friendly (no, not just because he maybe, perhaps, gave us free pita bread). Long story short, I'd like to come here again for food OTHER than appetizers. And I know that there is another Vig, but I'm going to have a hard time going to any Vig other than the Uptown.\n"

aS'"""Drinking coffee and Espresso has become my new hobby (or dare I say obsession) due in large part to the opening of this funky and original coffee Lab.  The passion of the owner, to stay true to traditional barista ways, is nothing short of extraordinary.  While enjoying one of their amazing drinks, the thought comes to mind, this is what coffee is supposed to taste like!!  Darn the behemoths of the coffee industry for herding us like cattle through their identical shops while shoving expensive sub par coffee our way.  I say no more!  I want to sip a perfectly made drink in a place that feels like home.  Cartel Coffee Lab is that place.  The sweet and fragrant smell of the freshly roasted beans lingers in the air.  I almost feel like the owner should charge for the smell alone.  Because the beans are roasted on site, you truly can not get a fresher cup of coffee anywhere.  There are no old pots of coffee hanging out indefinitely on their warmers.  Every cup of coffee is brewed fresh for around $1.  I know, don\'t even get me started on the prices!  Your buck is definitely getting \\banged\\"""" at this place.  This place will not disappoint!!"""""""\n'

aS'"""Stylish and hip yet humbly manages to stay comfortable and understated; St. Francis is almost one of the best restaurants I\'ve visited in a long time. \\n\\nThere are enough interior design details to satisfy our inner Martha and a menu that\'s well presented and executed, so why the \\almost\\""""? The service was off. Our servers couldn\'t decide who we belonged too, another table\'s food was served to us, then our salads and soups came out with the entrees, huge no-no. For a restaurant that\'s been open well over a year, these kinds of rookie mistakes, while forgivable, are just out of place and confusing. It\'s a fact we all have off days, they clearly were having theirs.\\n\\nIn the semi-open kitchen you\'ll see their custom built wood burning oven which is the cooking method for many of the dishes on the menu. Now maybe I\'m nitpicking, but normally at this caliber of restaurant, bread is simply part of the service. At St. Francis to get a few slices of their fantastic house made baguette, served with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt ($2) you\'ll have to ante up. I know it\'s only a few bucks and really is a sign of the times, but really? So the bread was chewy and had an excellent developed flavor, okay it was worth it. \\n\\nWhen our Meatballs ($12) with Moroccan spice, tomato sauce, egg and olive oil toast arrived I swear there was cheese on top. After one bite of these meaty spheres there was no cheese at all, ends up the egg was so light and airy that it had a cheese like texture. This is that one dish that will keep me coming back over and over, such a taste departure from the typical Italian style. \\n\\nI\'d highly suggest ordering the fork tender Pot Roast ($17). Better than moms, it was served with sweet corn polenta, bok choy, carrots and tomatoes, rustic and deliciously fulfilling. The white fish of the night ended up being a thick fillet of Mexican Grouper ($23). Like everything else, perfectly cooked, the plump flavorful fish was served with carrots atop a pillowy mound of mashed potatoes. If you\'re craving a burger, try the French Onion Burger ($13) with its smoked bacon, Gruyere cheese and crispy onions, its a beautiful thing.    \\n\\nSticky Toffee Pudding ($7) with sweet cream gelato, was an excellent way to end such a great meal. \\n\\nThe food at St. Francis was on point with every dish being excellent. I look forward to an on day when the service matches the food."""""""\n'

aS"I really don't understand all the complaints about this place.  I've been going here for years, and the food has always been solid, cheap, quick and really tasty.  The menu is huge, and I have no complaints about the service or cleanliness of the place, either.  \\n\\nI usually get the fried tofu with garlic sauce.  It's transcendent.  Crispy, delicious triangles of fried tofu and a fantastic mushroom-garlic-onion sauce with some brown rice....I have dreams about it.  If I have the cash, I'll get some spring rolls with spicy mustard, which are a hot, crispy delight.\\n\\nHaters gonna hate, I guess.  I just wish it was open all night!\n"

aS'I absolutely love this place.  When you pull up and valet, does not feel like you are in AZ anymore.  It feels like you are somewhere exotic (Mediterranean).  The rich earthy colors are just so warm and welcoming.  Love it!  I ordered the Pan roasted halibut for dinner.  It is served with a fine herb potato gallette, saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms  and  vegetables with red wine butter sauce.  Too yummy for words to explains.  You need to try it out for yourself.  Just too terrific!!  I picked the Chocolate Fantasy (French chocolate silk on a decadent chocolate cake with chocolate sauce served with vanilla gelato) for my after dinner pleasure.  Again, too yummy for words.  This is the perfect place for the perfect date, anniversary dinners, and any romantic event.  Just one of the best dinner experiences that I have had.\n'

I greatly enjoy Thai and absolutely expect good atomosphere in a place as well and I got that at Malee's. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was better than expected. I loved the lighting (or slight lack thereof) and the different booths and tables available. My only complaint was that there happened to be a girl playing piano while we were there, but not knowing this when we arrived, we were seated in an area where we couldn't hear her at all.\\n\\nThe staff was very attentive and I was constantly having my water refilled without even gesturing that I needed it. This was perfect because the heat and spice of the food was exactly what I wanted :)\\n\\nThe unique names of the menu items were fantastic also and I kinda giggled a little bit (and still do). I had an appetizer of Siamese Kisses and a main course titled Evil Jungle Princess. \\n\\nI'd definitely go back here again. It was a great experience.\n"

But somehow I stopped going to Denny's and now they have changed and this is for the better. They have brought back the free breakfast grand slam and they have menu options in $2, $4, $6, and $8 options plus their faithful standbys. I am talking about the Super Bird people the best sandwich for the last 4 decades.  Anyway in this economy sometimes you want to just chill out and talk to your friends and Denny's has always been that and so much more for me. Reunited and it feels so good.\n"

aS"Went to @eatverde for my first #smunch with @smunchphoenix.\\n\\nRight off the bat, this is a combined review, as I'm including my experience tasting Verde's red and green pork from the @GetYourPHX event at @CoHootsPHX.\\n\\nThe layout, and interior decor of Verde is simple, minimalist, but perfect for the image they seem to want to present; don't get caught up thinking about the seats, or the tables, or the art, just enjoy the incredible food we make.\\n\\nAnd they do.\\n\\nThe green chile pork is simply the best I've had, ever. The red chile pork is fantastic, and I would die a happy man if I never ate anything else.\\n\\nYes, it is that good.\\n\\nBut wait, it gets better; they make their own tortillas, by hand, from scratch ingredients.\\n\\nAnd how are the tortillas, you ask.\\n\\nLet me just say that I probably ate about 2 dozen, when Joe brought his product to Co+Hoots.\\n\\nThis morning, for Smunch, I opted for a chorizo and egg burrito, because morning + Mexican food = chorizo.\\n(I think that's actually what it means in Spanish)\\n\\nHonestly, I was slightly disappointed by the chorizo.\\nI know most people dislike chorizo because it is so greasy. But what they don't understand, and I do, is that the oil is where the flavor is. The spices permeate the oil, not the meat. Sure, the meat has flavor, but when the meat is too dry, it certainly has a decreased presence.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I may have had too-high expectations for all things Verde, after experiencing the bliss of their green chile pork.\\n\\nRegardless, the burrito was tasty, and a sizable portion, for a really good price. There was a good amount of egg, as well.\\nI will likely get it again, simply because chorizo is my go-to for breakfast.\\n\\nOne more thing; the coffee. I was informed that it was merely a generic coffee brand, but the flavor was considerably better than Denny's or Carrow's, or even the Circle K coffee. I didn't just appreciate the coffee, I enjoyed it.\\n\\nFor the burrito alone, I would have only given 4 stars. But the combination of the previous pork experience, the pleasant coffee experience, and the interior that I definitely appreciate, I will give them five.\\n\\nI will, without question, return to Verde, time and again.\n"

aS"Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St.  and  Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad.\n"

aS"I was incredibly excited to learn about the opening of this establishment. I'm a fan of Wurstkuche in LA and try to go there when I'm in town (which isn't often, considering my total distaste for that entire city) and was happy to hear that there would be something similar in my neck of the words (albeit in Scottsdale--who sort of wants to be LA but just....isn't). \\n\\nThis place blows Wurstkuche out of the water.\\n\\n1) The patio, even though it was 105 on a Saturday evening, was extremely comfortable due to the huge mister they've installed. Feel free to sit out on it..you'll be comfortable enough.\\n\\n2) The service was fantastic the entire night. I was sure that the evening would be a total cluster**** because it was the first Saturday night they would be open. I expected long food and drink waits and general order and ticketing screw ups. None of that happened, even though there were 9 of us on 4 different checks and we were there for three hours. The servers and the food runners were all extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the beer, the food, and what toppings/mustards went well with what. I don't know who Payton has doing his front of the house training (it's probably him, anyway), but kudos to educating your team.\\n\\n3) The ingredients are fresh and the food is all crafted in house. All sausages are made in house (and they're for sale at the front counter if you want to take them to go). The kraut is handmade. The pickles are handmade. I believe they bake their own bread. The pretzels are handmade. The fries are hand cut. All of the sauces are handmade (the hush hush sauce, a very close variant to Thousand Island dressing, had their chopped homemade pickles in it). Anything they don't make in house is purchased from local vendors/farms. \\n\\n4) The beer selection rules. Belgian prices, as stated, are a bit overpriced if you ask me. However, they have some great American-made Belgian Style options (finally got around to trying a Green Flash Le Freak and it did NOT disappoint). Don't be an ahole and order a Bud Light--which they don't have. (Although, I did see they have PBR in the can there...guess it's for the hipsters).\\n\\n5) The food is just really really good. Strong flavors, perfectly seasoned good. Everyone at the table had something different and everyone raved about how good their sausages were. We were also lucky enough to sample a just-crafted recipe that wasn't on the menu yet--a beer cheese fondue served with their house made pretzels. Even though we were all stuffed, we managed to devour it. Dessert was also fantastic; that drunken date cake is a must try. \\n\\nRumors abound that there will be other locations--I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a downtown location as it's closer to my house. Until then, I can't imagine we won't be making regular treks to this new place. Congrats, Payton.\n"

Nothing amazing, but solid.\\n\\nThen there came the Crab. Half a snow crab, with an 8oz Steak and a side of roasted corn. As I started drooling, my stomach did a backflip from excitement.

So moving to Arizona, I had to leave that behind and settle for wannabe Viet restaurants and whatnot.\\n\\nSo when I found unPhogettable, I shuttered to see a pho restaurant title without a number after it and incorporating a terrible pun that makes my teeth grind.\\n\\nBut I walked inside and hey! It SMELLS like a good pho restaurant! =)\\n\\nOrdered a bowl of pho tai and it was pretty decent! The broth they make is surprisingly flavor and they somehow use less MSG and fats than their Californian counterparts without sacrificing flavor.

However, I felt that Taliesin West had a great deal of rich flavors and cultural significance that I decided it was worth raving about.\\n\\nWell what's to say? Frank Lloyd Wright's winter home is a stunning piece of architecture that many can learn from and admire. The 60-90 minute tour is very fun and highlights Mr. Wright's genius thought processes in building design and also delivers several colorful and delightful anecdotes of a stubborn old man who had to have his way.\\n\\nThe pictures here are Yelp are gorgeous but half of the fun is listening to the tour guides explain why certain rooms are shaped the way they are and how the history of this place came to be. It's all fascinating stuff and I highly recommend it. Also, the gift shop has lots of neat doodads that might be worth taking home. It's all a little expensive, yeah, but if you're into art and architecture, Taliesin West is a really fun place to be culturally enlightened.\n"

The food was spot on as well, I am not sure the last time I was compelled to order a chicken fried steak and eggs at 10:00 am but after a little encouragement from our server I took the leap, and I am glad I did. I am not sure if they were the best ever, but they were very close. The steak had a well seasoned batter and was very good, My eggs over easy were perfectly prepared, and and believe it or not my meal came with three delicious light and fluffy pancakes. My girlfriend, had the biscuits and gravy and they were well above average, light flakey crust, and delicious gravy. Oak's is a perfect location for the home style breakfast of your dreams, but Oaks does not provide me with memories of its ambiance, if you are looking for eggs with a view, look elsewhere.\n"

We decided to move to the restaurant side and sit in a booth which made for a much more comfortable and relaxing dining experience.  My friend ordered the Kona Cheeseburger with fries (the smaller 6 oz) which didn\'t look entirely special and the portion of fries seemed quite small.  He must have been really hungry as he wolfed it down with no complaints.  I had a hard time deciding what to order...I was hungry but not starving.  I noticed that they\'ve changed their appetizers and no longer offer the giant onion rings :(  I opted for a fairly healthy option, the Sushi Combo ($11) which includes eight california rolls, and one each of salmon, tuna and shrimp.  The house salad (dressing on the side) was very fresh and tasty.

aS"I'm actually a pretty big fan of PGC. I was first treated to Mahmoud's culinary talent way back in the day (late 90's), when he owned the Green Leaf Cafe up on 19th Ave (where Fattoush is today). His current location is much nicer, but the food is still center stage. One critique that I've heard over the years is that people were expecting something different due to the name. PGC is not a Persian restaurant. It is however a place for great Vegetarian and healthy options that taste unbelievably decadent; flavored with spices and herbs that are typically associated with Persian cuisine.\\n\\nThe menu is quite large, with slight variances between lunch and dinner (dinner has more seafood and meat options - but honestly they let me order anything at anytime). There are always daily specials which are generally based on whatever Mahmoud finds at the daily market and items are clearly marked as Vegetarian, Vegan, or Carnivorous.\\n\\nMy biggest challenge at PGC is narrowing down the choices to a reasonable amount of food (which isn't easy because the portions can be quite large).\\n\\nSome things that shine as stars on the menu:\\n* the hummus - served with fresh veggies and house made nan\\n* barley soup (when it is one of the daily soups) - this stuff is loaded with vegetables and barley\\n* angel hair feta or spicy chicken garden salad - both are HUGE and crammed full of the most amazing organic vegetables found in phx, then lightly tossed in the house dressing that is crisp and brings out the flavors of every ingredient\\n*purple shoots - asparagus and eggplant, topped with saut\\u00e9ed onions, garlic, scallion, tomatoes, fresh herbs, lemon juice and feta cheese\\n*herb stew with chicken - I don't even know how to describe this one, but it truly rocks!\\n\\nMost of the meals are served with brown and white basmati rice topped with a toasted almond-raisin-saffron mix, a homemade cugurt sauce and fresh nan. I could probably make a meal on this stuff alone.\\n\\nPGC has a small selection of wines, but their flavored teas are so out of this world that I could float away on them. The peach tea is like none other that I have ever tried!\\n\\nThe only thing that I'm not a big fan of are the deserts - with the exception of the ginger and rose petal ice cream. If I'm going to splurge calories on desert, it's not going to be on a Vegan Cheesecake. But that ice cream... my mom and I split one and the first bite I took was weird and wonderful all at the same time - by the time we got to the bottom of the bowl we were having a spoon fight that required black-belt finger moves.\\n\\nThis is an unexpected little place that is relaxed and unpretentious while simultaneously offering table cloths and candles. It's not cheap, but they definitely make up for it in quality and large portions. Call ahead to check the schedule if you are interested in going on a night when they have belly dancing (usually the only time you need a reservation).\n"

Base on my relative's recommendation I took my son to this facility.\\n\\nDr Cohen did a thorough examination to ensure the symptoms were not serious, prescribed some medicine and made some recommendations to ensure his coughing would not worsen.\\n\\nAll in all a very pleasant experience, no one expects to get sick during a vacation/trip but when it happens, it's good to know that facilities  and  staff like Healthy Outlook are there to help  and  understand\n"

aS"I have to whole heartedly disagree with the other diners here. I think this place is fantastic! We had reservations and did not have to wait at all. The service was prompt and our waiter was attentive, although he could have been a bit friendlier. \\n\\nWe had the spaghetti and meatballs, the pork chop, and the scotch beef. The meatballs were some of the best I've ever tasted and the pork chop was definitely in the top three pork chops I've ever had. The scotch beef was very good too, although it could have been seasoned a bit more. We had the bourbon bread pudding for dessert. Heaven! Absolute heaven! \\n\\nWe will definitely be back every time we are in the Phoenix area!\n"

Had a few too many drinks and want to ride the bull? It makes for great entertainment for those like me who love people watching anyways.\\n\\nThis place is definitely a 'high energy, rock-western experience'.\\n\\n*please note, this is a review of Saddle Ranch as a spot to hang out, the food has not been tested by yours truley*\n"

aS'My girlfriend and I had dinner here with my brother and his wife this past Saturday. It was packed outside so we had to sit outside which was fine. If anything it got a little too warm under the heat lamps, but the atmosphere was fine.\\n\\nFood was very tasty across the board. We had steak and organic chicken on our side of the table both of which were cooked exactly how we wanted them. Juicy and tender. \\n\\nService was excellent. Recommended.\n'

We order procciuto and asiago cheese as appetizers, they come with some bread and some dip, it was good. For dinner we ordered the pizza w/ sausage and sage I don't remember the name, it was pretty good. The food came quick, the staff was friendly. Highly recommended.\n"

aS"Perfect hole in the wall Mexican food restaurant! Quint,authentic, family owned, just the perfect atmosphere.Great Margaritas! which is always what breaks or makes a Mexican restaurant for me. My friends and I split some awesome oysters which i was apprehensive about at first, just because this place really is the definition of 'hole in the wall,' but they turned out to be great... then again it was my first experience eating oysters... We all ordered burritos which were also very good, I love a place that isn't afraid to use dark meat chicken. I mean why do restaurants always advertise white meat chicken anyways?  that's what usually steers me away from ever ordering chicken in the first place! For sure gotta come back to try more of their menu!\n"

aS"I could not be happier with this preschool. My first child is going to graduate to kindergarten this year and my second will be in the 3's class next year.  The teachers are outstanding.  After researching so many other preschools the thing about this preschool that makes it stand out is the community and the parent education.  As a first time parent not only was I not ready to send my child off to school and not be part of it but there was so much I didn't know.  Since this school is a co-op I was able to carry through with what my son learned at school and reinforce it at home.  I learned so much from the expert teachers.  In addition, I have formed close bonds to the other co-oping parents.  I can't think of a better way to model a sense of community to my children than to actually live it.  The school offers a developmentally appropriate curriculum and allows children to learn through play.  I could go on and on about this school and it's community!\n"

aS'Place is pretty good after new ownership took affect. Pretty clean and organized. I would give the food 4/5 stars. Better than most chinese buffet places. Looks like all employees are actually Chinese. Your drink is always filled since they check up on it regularly. I actually had more than I could drink they filled it so often. Prices are good at $6.99 per person during lunch. Dinner is $9.99 per person. Children 3-5 is $2.99 as the check said. Soda is $1.49. And guess what, REAL ICE CREAM. We were pretty happy about that.

aS'After spending a lovely day looking at musical instruments, or enjoying one of the concerts the MIM has, what better way to finish off your experience than to get lunch at this delectable cafe?  The food here has an emphasis on sustainable and locally produced food.  They have a lot of unique dishes here, and the menu changes daily.  Some examples include ahi tuna and caviar pizza, braised beef with potatoes, and unusual (and tasty) dessert such as chilled rhubarb soup with cake squares.  The portions are very filling, and service is excellent for a cafeteria style establishment.  Some of the dishes can be hit and miss, but I give them points for trying at least.  For instance, the tuna on the pizza I tried was a little overcooked and a little fishy tasting for me, and a chicken sandwich I had was bordering on the dry side.  The beef I have had here though has been very tender and flavorful so far though.  The cafeteria itself is in an open, airy, sunny locale, which provides a good view of the outdoors while you eat your meal.\n'

aS'Went there last night with a group of 32, for a special family celebration.

aS"Went here yesterday with the family to celebrate a birthday and it was amazing. This is my second time to City Hall and we will definitely be back! The service is outstanding and they do a great job accommodating and helping you make your way around the menu, etc. We started with cocktails and our server recommended a drink not listed on the menu; a cherry lemon drop. It was delicious and the presentation was great, too. It comes out similar to the seafood tower and is so cold the drink bubbles when they put it in the glass. Very cool. We got the seafood tower where they will give you almost any number you like for each option, which is certainly helpful when you have a table of people who can't decide! \\n\\nFor the meal we got a variety of their steaks: ribeye, porterhouse, KC strip and all were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Absolutely delicious! Our family is in the meat business and my dad said it was one of the best steaks he had ever had. We shared the lobster mashed potatoes (amazing!) and some mushrooms. All in all it was a great place to have a celebration!\n"

I was able to return my pc with out incident. The agent followed my problem start to finish via telephone and email.

aS"Anytime I can't hitch a ride to the airport I always park at PreFlight.  Why?  Because it takes much less time than parking at the airport itself, it's cheaper (check out the coupons on the website!) and they have a Frequent Parker Program so I earn a free day for every five days parked.  Now, I always liked PreFlight but last week I decided that I love them because after returning from an awesome weekend in Vegas I hopped on the PreFlight shuttle bus (which comes every few minutes) and arrived at the lot to find a sad car with a dead battery.\\n\\nIt was hot and I was in no mood to play games with my car.  I tried and tried but I couldn't get her to come to life.

aS"Ok I say this every time, but I do not like to make a habit of giving a place 5 stars in my first try, but at Fate I can't help myself. Everything from the ambiance, food, happy hour, beer, and even cake pops were simply amazing!!,\\n\\nI'll start with my favorite, beer. We got here early during happy hour and thought that my wife and I would order 2 beers each. So I ordered the Smoked Porter and she had Imperial IPA. Trying these I would say the imperial IPA was really good. 8.5 100lbu. Very tasty! The smoked porter was great too. Not really my thing but with food it tasted good. A little on the over smoked flavor but I respect that. After we had the pale ale and Irish Red. The pale ale was 6.0 and it was more on par of average IPA.  The Irish Red was amazing! A strong but refreshing red. This was my wife's favorite beer. Mine has to be the imperial IPA. \\n\\nDuring HH we ordered the pizza bread very good. Basically cheese bread on their pizza dough. It came with a side of marinara. I would total order it again next time we are at HH\\n\\nWe then decided to order a pizza to share. We chose the rustic pizza which including artichoke hearts, fennel,sausage, gorgonzola cheese. I thought it was excellent pizza! Even better with a craft beer next to you. \\n\\nAnyways our experience at Fate was excellent. Id like to add that the service was excellent and liked the layout of the restaurant and the small brew tanks. This place is small but seems like a lot of room at the bar and a decent sized patio.  \\n\\nOh one more thing, when we were walking out, my wife spotted the cake pop display. We had to turn around and ordered 2! 2 bucks each and well worth it!! We tried the sinker doodle and peppermint red velvet. The red velvet was the best! A little harder shell but once you ate more they were very moist. Do your self a favor and order at least one on your way out!!\n"

aS"Best. Frozen. Yogurt. Place. Ever. Period.\\n\\nLove that they change up the flavors every now and then. The seasonal oatmeal raisin and pumpkin flavors are amazing. They let you control all your toppings (NOT like that other place). They also have seasonal toppings too. Right now they have Cracker Jacks as toppings to celebrate baseball spring training Cactus League.  If the number of flavors overwhelms you, there are free sample cups that you can pick up at the register upon entering the shop.  The price per ounce is also very reasonable. I love this place and I always try to think of excuses to come here :) \\n\\nI can't wait to take my sister here when she comes to visit me!\n"

aS"A simple, healthy, pleasant meal without pretense in the Scotts Rd/Frank Lloyd Wright neighborhood.  Yeah, right - it doesn't exist except at Miracle Mile.  Anytime we want to eat, we always have to choose between spending over an hour doing it (between waiting for a table and service focused on upsell), gut busting food or driving 15 minutes away (back to the hour plus).  Miracle Mile has great diversity on their menu, gets you in and out, and has tons of seating in a pretty pleasant and very clean dining area.  Miracle Mile probably isn't worth driving out of my way for, but I'm sure glad it's nearby.\n"

aS"There are very few places who can get me to eat chicken that is not boneless/skinless and this is one of them! Not only can they get me to eat it, the jerk chicken here can get me to drive across town on my lunch hour just to indulge. Generous portions of juicy, tender, flavorful chicken piled in one corner of a styrofoam take out tray partnered with loads of rice (flavors vary, for example: rice and beans or pumpkin rice) and your choice of plantains or (my choice) steamed cabbage for about $10 with a drink. The cabbage is still crisp and firm and a nice, mild crunch to go with the rest of the meal. The staff is incredibly friendly. Seating is very limited (stools facing a narrow counter that runs the perimeter of the small restaurant's space) -- but, in a way that makes it convenient to eat alone and be left to stuff your face! \\n\\nBYO wet wipes though, fair warning!\n"

They have a wide range of baked goods, including gourmet breads and pastries, cookies, and other goodies (even fresh hummus!), as well as great iced tea and other drinks. I walked down there today and got a wonderfully delicious sandwich on their fresh 9-grain bread, along with chips and a drink for under $8. The staff and owner are all friendly, the place is charming and has dine-in seating indoors or on the patio, and they make it fast and fresh. Thanks, Bread Basket! You guys are awesome.

After sports were over (around 10), the barkeep put on some Japanese gore movie on the DVD that was very entertaining. Prices seemed fair, even cheap. Very friendly bartender and seemed like a great place to just hang out with friends and play pool or chat. Probably wouldn't go here on a busier night like a weekend but it was nice tonight. And, bonus, they have absinthe!\n"

aS'I did write an update giving 5 stars but then we went tonight and I had to take it back. We ordered an appetizer, salad, and sandwich to share plus a burger for our two year old. It all came out at the same time. That is a huge pet peeve of mine at restaurants, Our table was so full we had no room for our plates, we had to eat the hot sandwich first, then the hot appetizer (which was almost cold by that time) and then the salad. And try to keep the hot plates away from our kiddo. Not cool. How difficult is it for them to understand, one dish at a time in a timely manner unless otherwise specified. Still love it there, next time we will have to ask and be more specific.\n'

aS"I met a friend here for brunch on Sunday, and it was a good breakfast spot. It was CRAZY busy though! But, it's order at the counter style, so no matter how busy it is, you can get your order in. Then the only problem is finding a table. We finally got one, but it was RIGHT by the main entrance, so not the best feng shui. \\n\\nPROS: The patio is dog-friendly, it's a happening spot, they have a unique menu, and you can get your order in right away.\\n\\nCONS: Parking is a nightmare. It's really packed. They call your name when your order is ready and it's IMPOSSIBLE to hear them call you when it's busy, so if you're not waiting right by the kitchen, your food will get cold! Mine did. Also, strangely, the tables do not have salt and pepper on them...so...um...bring your own??? idk. I like to put salt and pepper on my eggs, but there wasn't any on the table! Also, NO HOT SAUCE! I asked the woman at the counter for hot sauce, and she seemed surprised! She said to ask the people at the coffee counter....weird. Um...no...they did not have any hot sauce at the coffee counter. I'd still go back again, but I would just bring salt, pepper, and hot sauce!\n"

aS"This is easily my favorite cafe in all of Tempe - and perhaps the Valley - for lunch and baked goods.  The atmosphere is charming and understated from the way you order to the friendly service you wouldn't expect from a counter service kind of place.\\n\\nI'm always torn on whether to order the croque monseiur or the warm open faced steak sandwich.  Both of the sandwiches are superbly prepared and presented.  You can't go wrong with either.  I always opt for the dijon potato side salad garnished with mustard seed.\\n\\nThe warm open faced steak sandwich is tastefully done with tender grilled ribeye with a cabernet butter and sauteed mushrooms and bleu cheese.  Rich, sinful and bad but in a good way, kind of like sex with an old ex.  Similarly the croque monseiur has me hooked, but their use of de-seeded jalapenos adds a distinctive Arizona touch that I just love.\\n\\nWhile waiting for my lunch I can never resist their outstanding macarons (I prefer the chocolate, but both are delicious), cakes and cookies (go for the chocolate truffle) displayed so innocently behind the glass case where you order.\\n\\nSince I am friends with someone who works here, she doesn't serve us (company policy), so service is usually by the manager, and once we even got the chef, which was a nice surprise because I was able to ask her details on the sandwiches.\\n\\nAnd finally, because they use organic and locally grown ingredients you can leave feeling like not-so much of an asshat.\n"

aS"A great all-around stadium to watch the game.  With the exception of a few spaces on the lawn, there are no bad seats in the house, and the stadium still has a great classic baseball look to it.\\n\\nWe always opt for the lawn seats.  Let's be honest, most people that sit in the lawn of this stadium never watch more than 5 pitches.  It is a people-watching, party scene.  If you are lucky enough to get there a bit earlier, get a good spot on the lawn, and you can enjoy the best of both - baseball  and  people.\\n\\nWhat I really love about this park is the food / beer.  How can you not enjoy a San Fran game without a classic San Fran Beer - Anchor Steam and Garlic Fries from Gordon Biersch.  Minus the heat, you feel like you are right in the bay area.  Plus, you can smell the fries cooking 3 sections over.\\n\\nIf you are an autograph junkie, they usually have a good (but repetitive) line up of old stars behind 3rd base signing autographs.\\n\\nParking is limited directly around the park, but you can usually snake a spot in a neighborhood or park in Old Town and take the trolley or walk.\\n\\nA HUGE knock on this park - ticket prices.  Just about everywhere else in AZ you can get a lawn seat for a spring training game around $8.  At the Scottsdale Stadium - $19.25!  They also do flex-pricing here, which means if a popular team (Dodgers / Cubs) are there the ticket prices will go up.\\n\\nIf you are new to AZ, and want to see a game, you can't go wrong here.  Plus, afterward, most people spill right into old town to keep the party going!\\n\\n* This spring training, I took on an aggressive goal.  Go to all 10 Spring Training Parks  and  see all 15 teams in one spring training season, and do it all on the weekends (FRI-SUN).  This review is a part of 10 total reviews.\n"

They were not busy yet and we were seated at that time. Our waiter was Matthew a very energetic and helpful person. He told us about the special and answered the questions we had for entr\\u00e9es we were considering. My wife decided on the Margherita Pizza and me on the Ahi Tuna. Their pizza is on a very thin crust which is how we prefer it. The Ahi was ordered rare. When our order arrived the waiter said he thought the Ahi may be a little more cooked than I had ordered and offered to take it back if I wanted one less cooked. It was cooked more than I would have liked but I told him it was fine. It was a very nice piece of meat. We had great service. Matthew was very attentive but not overly attentive. All our needs were met and we will definitely go back. The staff is a great group of people. Oh the pizza was very good and more than most would eat at one setting.\n'

Why have a sausage link when you can suck on chicken feet? Don't worry, not everything is that exotic.

The menu is very extensive and could take you a couple of hours to finally decide on something.  Or you can make it easier for your party by asking for the family menu that contains a set of items they recommend.  This route is typically cheaper and feed more if you have a large group.  If you are adventurous, ask for the family menu that is Chinese! Can't read, server can help translate.\\n\\nSeafood is always fresh as they have live tanks in the restaurant.

We retreated to another supermercado, our dreams of tacking a whack at the opening day pi\\u00f1ata completely dashed.\\n\\nFortunately, Helen Y. and i were combing the area before going to Tim Finnegans, so we checked it out. The layout is almost identical to the Ranch Market on 16th st. and Roosevelt, with the same amazing produce and aguas frescas. The seafood bar isn't as snazzy, and I'm not sure they have grab 'n'  go containers of salsa -- you can buy it by the pound at the salsa bar, which would take an extra 30 seconds or so. \\n\\nWhat's cool about this location (besides being a ten minute drive from the Melrose District), is that the Costco Business Center shares the parking lot, and they sell dirt-cheap restaurant supplies. A trip to both places could outfit a barren fridge and kitchen for about 18 bucks.

aS"Went here only once, but it left a fairly strong impression.  I'd recently discovered Yelp and found myself taking notes through the whole thing about things I wanted to say - then I threw that away and decided to go w/ my gut.  I mention that, because it feel like that's what this place is like - someone originally had this list of the detailed things that needed to be included, then they just sort of scraped that and did something in between.  It wants to be upscale (to pay the rent and bring in the chicks) but in the end it's a bar with tons of beer and upscale bar food.  When it comes to food (this is where the list comes in) they have everything - burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, seafood, chicken fried chicken, mac  and  cheese, rice bowl, steaks, ribs and a bevy of desert options.  I mean - really?  What made you decide you needed to tackle a menu that big?  Trying to compete w/ Cheesecake factory?  Pricing is about the same as well - but serving sizes are not. These are smaller.\\n\\nI'll be honest - the food was pretty good.  Our server was particularly helpful in helping the guys plow their way through the beer lists.  They didn't sing for his birthday (BIG plus!) but they totally respected that it was a special occasion dinner.  As the night went on, my brother's only complaint was that for a place that specialized in beer, the bathroom shouldn't have been so far away from where folks sit - located by the front door.  I thought that was a noble observation, even if he was slurring a bit as he mentioned it...\n"

While the lollipops were a hit, the stuffed shrimp had a bit too much horseradish. The best part of the shrimp was the funny faces that ensued after the horseradish kicked in. The bread was also good, accompanied by a pesto and blue cheese butter.\\n\\nBetween the five of us we ordered the Tuna and Halibut, Chilean Chilean Sea Bass, and Swordfish.

The girl who seated us was really nice and gave an enjoyable contribution to the dining experience. Yes this place cost almost twice what I pay across town but worth it with the right company. My brother and I ate here and we both agreed we would probably not eat here together much but we will both be eating here again. AKA we thought this was alot better place to take a girl or a business associate than our fav pho in the area to have lunch together.  Cyclo has a more upscale atmosphere than the average pho and we both thought the food is above average.\\nI don\'t agree with another reviewers post that the portions here are small. I had one appetizer with a pho bowl and left full.  I\'m 6\'3\\ 230 and like to eat ALOT and my brother who is shorter but heavier than me was complaining he ate too much after we left. One of the best phos in the east valley!"""""""\n'

aS"I have just experience food heaven and a food coma all in one! I have always wanted to try this place because I have heard such good things. Their sunset menu before a show at the Gammage Theater was the perfect excuse. Honestly it was such a good deal for so much food and such tasty options. I went with my sister and we each tried something different off the menu and shared. For starters we got the edamame hummus and garden salad. The wonton chips with the hummus were so good and the salad was so light and refreshing. \\n\\nFor the second course I got the vegetable tempura and popcorn shrimp. Both of which were good, but I would go with the shrimp. The vegetable tempura was good but a bit heavy before the final course. \\n\\nI got the salmon as my main course and my sister got the filet. The salmon was perfectly cooked, but I didn't need the rice and the sauce was slightly too sweet for me. The filet was so good with a great teriyaki sweet sauce and perfectly smooth mashed potatoes. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful in our selections and the ambiance was nice. Not super crowded but we had an early reservation. I want to go back and try the rest of the menu.\n"

aS'"""I was never excited about bagels before in my life until Big City.  Now I look forward to sneaking over there a few times a week for one of their freshly made delicacies.  BCB is family owned and family run and the kids are just wonderful, hard working people.  \\n\\nI know that they have specials after two for a dozen bagels and they look like they wonderful sandwiches.  All that I know thus far is that the quality of their bagels is second to none.  They are larger than the competitors and prepared better.  The coffee is great, and is self serve.  The store is clean and has about 5 or 6 tables outside so you may enjoy your day or take your dog along for a bite.\\n\\nI never thought I\'d be raving about something as \\blah\\"""" as a bagel.  But BCB is so much more than that.  Enjoy!"""""""\n'

aS"Considering the price and city, this hotel totally deserves 5 stars for it's interesting styling and great design choices. The exterior of the hotel rooms has a retro feeling, while the interiors are furnished with modern furniture and decorations. The extra large tub (cornered by 2 frosted glass walls) even has a mood light shining down on it. You probably won't find another hotel this chic in all of Arizona.\\n\\nIf I ever come back to the Phoenix area again, I will be sure to book at this hotel again. It gets my highest recommendation.\\n\\nPrice Tip: Smartphone users should use the HotelTonight App, which will run last minute deals for this hotel.\n"

aS"I stumbled upon this restaurant when performing a Yelp search for Ceviche in Mesa the other day.\\n\\nI was a little skeptical due to some of the low ratings, but we decided to enter the humble looking venue, in the primitive looking strip mall.\\n\\nWe were immediately greeted and seated by a lovely hostess / server. She was extremely attentive and informative, as we were not familiar with Pupusas or much of the other Salvadorian Cuisine.\\n\\nWe ordered and shared the Shrimp Ceviche, which was garnished with fresh Avocado and Cucumbers. The freshly fried tortilla chips were very tasty, and the ceviche was a little more on the sweet side vs. the typical intense lime flavor. It was very fresh tasting, and we both really enjoyed it.\\n\\nWe were given a lesson in what Pupusas are, and asked our lovely waitress to pick three of her favorite choices and send them out. She chose Carne Asada, Chicharon with beans, and the last one was not quite identified, but was very tasty.\\n\\nBefore bringing out the Pupusas, she dropped off a small bowl of a red sauce, and a bowl of spicy cabbage, which were meant to be used as toppings for the Pupusas.\\n\\nWe both thought that the Pupusas were very simple, yet tasty. The spicy cabbage and red sauce as toppings really added flavor to the Pupusas.\\n\\nWe were impressed with what we perceived to be authentic Salvadorian Cuisine, so we ordered one last dish. \\n\\nWe had to try the fried Plantains, served with a black bean sauce, and Crema. The plantains were fried to perfection with nice caramelization. The black bean sauce was interesting, and the cream was a little on the salty side, rather than sweet as I would have expected. It is small details such as these which led us to believe that the food was authentic.\\n\\nDon't let the other reviews mislead you if you are looking for a fresh, authentic experience. \\n\\nIf you want a fancy location with beer and wine, then forget about it. This place is all about giving an authentic, down to earth, culinary experience to those who seek quality without the distraction of interior design.  :)\n"

aS"Wondering where to go to dinner tonight, we followed our senses and the cyber sensations coming from the deli's e-mail blast of tonight's menu. We made the long drive to Queen Creek from NE Mesa (on a week night!) and were rewarded handsomely with the usual amazing fare. My wife had the Panko Crusted Pork Schnitzel w/ Lemon Butter Sauce and I had the Slow Roasted Chicken Breast w/ Romesco Sauce.  As usual, the meats were a cut well above and the sides (Pearl Couscous w/ Roasted Tomatoes in my case) were inventive and came in generous portions (too bad I'm on a low carb diet!).  Don't let the butcher paper tablecloths and casual attitude fool you. the deli serves serious food! Blake and his staff know how to please!  Make the drive one time and you'll end up investing in a hybrid so you can afford to come back again and again and again.\n"

aS'"""As an East Coast 1st generation Italian, I was very excited to see a more casual version of Aiello\'s open very close to me, and on my way home from work no less.  I can tell this place will be trouble for my waistline.\\n\\nSalumeria means a store that sells cold cuts, meats, etc.  Aiello\'s does that and more.  I\'ve only had a sampling of their food so far and just based on the Sfogliatelle in the dessert case, I\'m in love.\\n\\nCaprese Paninni - absolutely delightful focaccia bread, fresh mozzarella, basil that smelled and tasted like it had just been picked and juicy tomatoes.  Divine.\\n\\nAnitpasto Salad - real Italian meats and cheeses, not those weird little sliced bundles of rolled up American meats and cheeses like you find at other places.  This salad was peppered with whole slices of imported Italian meats and a beautiful blend of greens and artichoke hearts.\\n\\nArancini - OK, I love these!  My Mom used to make them occasionally so I was thrilled to find them on their menu.  It\'s delicious!  A huge stuffed ball of rice in tomato sauce.  Way too big for me to finish so I am enjoying it for breakfast as I type this.\\n\\nNow, to the item that will most get me in trouble!\\nSfogliatelle - In Italian this word means \\many leaves\\"""" and that is what this pastry looks like. Some call it Lobster Tails..I call it by it\'s traditional name.  You have an option of two different fillings.  One is similar to cannolli filling...YUM.....the other is a sweet ricotta with citron...DOUBLE  YUM....  At almost 500 calories a pop, I\'ll really have to restrain myself or hit bootcamp twice a day!  Honestly haven\'t had Sfogliatelle this good since I left the East Coast.\\n\\nAiello\'s Salumeria, I will be back and am very much looking forward to it.  There\'s nothin\' better than a little midweek Italian foodgasm!"""""""\n'

Will definitely leave room to try dessert next time. \\n\\nThe server, Daniel? was wonderful! He did a great job.\\n\\nI would love to give them 5 stars but there are some kinks they have to work out - what new business doesn't? \\n\\nThey would hands down have 5 or more stars if they had:\\n\\n* A sign - people need to know if they are in the right place.\\n* Clear hours online and on the door and adhere to them. Every minute counts when it is insanely hot and people are on very limited lunch breaks.\\n* Open/closed sign. \\n* Cross-trained staff so even if the server is not there yet people can be served.\\n* Decreased wait time between being seated and receiving water/menus.\\n* A bell or something at the door so they hear customers coming.\n"

aS"Super friendly, great service, came in just before they stop serving Dim Sum at 3:00PM on a Saturday and chef was willing to make some for us on short notice.  \\n\\nA picture menu and ordering of a list like a sushi menu instead of having a cart roll out to you was neat.  And the picture menu really helped out my linner partner.  So we were able to get all the dishes we wanted delivered out to our table in one go which I found convenient.  \\n\\nThe Dim Sum was well executed, not greasy, and the price is right.   I'd rate it about the same level as House of Sifu in Chandler.   But bellow Great Wall or Golden Buda the the other 3 major Dim Sim places in the valley.\n"

aS"Los Olivos Norte is the North Scottsdale outpost of the original, located in Old Town.  This is your basic, everyday (American) Mexican food place.  Fajitas, combination platters, chips  and  salsa, etc. etc.  While Los Olivos Norte is not going to blow your socks off, it is good, typical Mexican food.  I give it four stars because I am a Mexican food addict.  If you do a good job (and they do), I'm going to be a fan.\\n\\nThe service here is QUICK.  Chips and salsa (plus a free bean dip!) came out immediately.  They were quick to take our order and the food was out, fresh and hot, about 10 minutes later.  Again, the food isn't going to change your life, but it is tasty and does the job.\n"

aS"I have been here when it was still a buffet when they first opened. I wasn't too thrilled as it was like any other buffet. The only cool thing I thought was the ice cream selection. \\n\\nWell that was then this is now...\\n\\nOn a very hungry late evening a fellow yelper Clifford and I were gonna meet up for some Chinese food. We were headed to our favorite spot on the east side. When I got there it was 5 min from closing and Clifford was still 15 min away. After discussing some options I made it down to Dobson and Warner to find Phoenix Palace open till 10. After giving Clifford a ring we met up there and gave it a shot. \\n\\nUpon entering I noticed that the place was empty, but not common on a monday night and with all the other places in the area closing early the complex is usually dead by 9. The place no longer having any buffet tables and many of the awful decor gone it could be promising. \\n\\nSeeing that their menu had some of my favorite dishes I thought I give it a shot. So some Spicy Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, Salted Fish Fried Rice and Beef Stew Hotpot. \\n\\nWow! Were we surprised with the food, especially this late at night. The pork chops were well seasoned to how they should be and very crispy on outside and juicy on the inside. The beef stew was wonderful, the meat was well cooked and the large pieces of the green onion was a great touch of flavor. The salted fish fried rice was not so great, it was very under seasoned and the portions for the fish and chicken were not a large as some places are with this dish. \\n\\nOn my second visit I tried a different fried rice dish and same thing very under seasoned. It seems like that the chef has very strong dishes and some other dishes are not so strong. I have yet to try the dim sum but i'm sure this is going to be very good as well.\n"

aS"Best body piercing shop I have EVER been to.  It was a little busy when I walked in but the guy at the counter, Chris,  greeted me right away and asked what I wanted to get done. I told him and he got all the paperwork started and showed me which jewelry I could choose from for each piercing (nostril and helix). Once I picked them out I still had to wait a little while but he kept a conversation going with everyone so that we were occupied.\\n\\nThe piercer I got was Dana and he was awesome. He's really funny and down to earth which took away any nervousness I had. He showed me a couple different options as far as placement for each of the piercings and didn't waste any time getting to it which I like. He was very quick actually doing the piercings and kept me talking the whole time so that I wasn't thinking about the fact that he was sticking needles into me.  After both piercings were done he made sure I was actually okay and wasn't just saying that to try and look tough.\\n\\nHe walked me out to pay and made sure I understood the care instructions and to feel free to stop by or call if I had any questions.  Chris emphasized that again while he was taking my payment and gave me Dana's card with their contact information and also the sizing of the jewelry I got. I left trying to think of what else I want to get pierced just because I had such a great experience there. I will definately be going back soon!\n"

I don't eat wings, but their sauce is so good, I'd love to buy a bottle of that stuff.  I've been ordering their Veggie Wedgie sandwich or the barbecue pizza when I'm with my cousin.. She adds all kinds of toppings to the pizza and I would recommend ordering a pizza w/ bbq sauce and then whatever else appeals to you..

aS'I was recently blessed with a little getaway that included a stay at Firesky Resort  and  Spa.  I have had my fair share of hotel experiences, and I have to say I was so pleasantly surprised by this venue.\\n\\nThe staff at the front desk and at the restaurant were very nice and helpful.  The cleaning crew did a great job tidying up the room and replacing all the amenities (shampoo, conditioner, and lotion from Aveda!).\\n\\nThe room was beautiful - great decor, comfy bed, nice flat screen tv, plenty of vanity space, super high water pressure in the shower, and complimentary cheetah-patterned robes for the duration of the stay.\\n\\nThe pool area is amazing!  Small waterfalls, one pool included a beach area complete with sand, perfect temperature for all hours of the day, and plenty of chairs and towels to accommodate any guests.\\n\\nI have to admit I was a little sad leaving the hotel.

This place is so unpretentious, it's a breath of fresh air.  If you don't know exactly what to ask for, the staff will ask you about what you've liked in the past, what flavor profiles you prefer, and a ton of other questions to narrow down exactly what you'll like.  3 times out of 3 they've nailed it on the head!\\nThey just recently added a happy hour menu and expanded their food menu as well...you have to try the smoked salmon bruschetta best I've had in the valley (even beats out postino's smoked salmon!)\\nTo top it off, this place even offers wine 101 classes, grape varietal classes, and even a book club!  \\nI think you get it by now: This place rules.\n"

aS"Now don't let my profile picture fool you, I am not, in the traditional sense, a Mexican. Shocking, I know. But, I do know my Mexican food, and Los Favoritos is awesome! Wonderful in fact. Delicious, cheap, clean and delicious.\\n\\n  This morning I got a bacon breakfast burrito with beans inside, and if you don't know, their breakfast burritos are their bread and butter, the money maker, and they never disappoint. The only problem you may ever have is the bacon being a little salty, and even then the always incredible hot sauce (or salsa, whatever) is there to save the day. The carne asada is very good, seasoned well and almost always very tender, the beans, which are cooked with wonderful, wonderful lard, are always just firm enough, never just a pile of mush, never watery, the chicken is juicy and tender, I just can't say enough about it. The only negative I have is that one of the counter girls is a bit rude, and there is a military service recruitment center right next door, so at times you may be bothered a little by them, but come on, they're serving our country, so it can be forgiven. \\n\\n  Los Favoritos is the best fast Mexican restaurant that I have discovered so far. Do yourself a favor and give them a visit, at either location (Tempe, Chandler) and tell them Kevin sent you, they'll probably just look at you funny, but why not?\n"

aS'Well, I am starting the year with JUVE AUTO CLINIC doing right by me as usual!!  I needed new brakes front and back on my 2006 Toyota Avalon and of course took my car to JUVE AUTO CLINIC.  Their waiting area is comfortable and when they know you are staying on site for the work to be completed are as accommodating as possible.  What made me really feel like family on this visit is that I had the wrong credit card with me and no problem - I could just call back with the right card when I got home.  That kind of trust to a loyal customer is what generates rave reviews. I was treated with respect with no upset because of a delay in payment.  Always friendly and always courteous and always doing a quality job is why I recommend JUVE AUTO CLINIC to anyone who wants great car repair at a reasonable price.\n'

aS"So I tried this place today and I was extremely impressed!  I'd had tortas before at a couple of the 'bertos places and while they were okay, they were nothing spectacular.  This place was delicious.  Everything on the menu sounded pretty good, but I ended up with the cubana torta and an alambre taco.  While the tacos was very small, it was very good.  The cubana torta was very good as well.  It was humongous!!!  I couldn't even finish the whole thing and I'm a girl that can eat, trust me, I'm from Texas!!!  It was full of meat and it had lots of avocado on it, which I loved.  Let me just warn you about the avocado looking sauce on the salsa bar.  That stuff is hot.  It's good, but it's very, very hot!  Just looking at it, you would think it wold be a mild sauce since it looks like a creamy avocado, but believe me, this is not for people that can't stand the heat!  It took me aback for a second because I seriously wasn't expecting that type of heat.  I still have a bit of sweat on my brow from it right now as I type this review.  Overall, this place is very good and I can't wait to try the quesadillas because they look pretty darn good themselves.  I also have to say the people that work there are very nice and friendly as well.  Bottom line, this place is excellent and I will definitely go back in the near future!\n"

They used to have Cuban salsa, which was a fantastic secret... they ought to bring that back.\\n\\nPrices: Very reasonable, just bring cash!\\n\\nStaff:  There's a kid who sings your order to you, and he's awesome.

It's a smaller store and they have been out of things I am looking for.  They have always offered to have things sent in for me or at least find it in another store so I can pick it up that day if I need it.\\n\\n Since I lost the store where I shopped enough that the magnetic strip was worn off my credit card, I have discovered Bed,  Bath,  and Beyond, does carry a wider range of products than I would have known otherwise.  The staff is for the most part, very knowledgeable about their stock.\\n\\nA special compliment to this store.  Occasionally I shop for a friend using her Amex card.

aS"This was my first time at Roy's and I have to say I was pretty impressed. Our server was awesome (I believe her name was Kelani) she did a great job of answering all of our questions. I started off with the Hawaiian martini and my fiance had the cucumber cilantro margarita both were very good and unique although kind of pricey. We then had the Asian soft tacos which weren't personally my favorite however John loved them. I ordered the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and originally when it came out it was super salty I could barely taste anything else at all. I let our waitress know and she was very quick to fix the issue and brought me out a whole new plate and it was amazing, nice, flaky, and moist it had great flavor. I had also ordered a side of the pesto risotto and that was tasty as well. John ordered the white truffle and black pepper sea scallops which were cooked to a perfect medium as he had asked also served with the risotto. Both meals were so good we had to force ourselves to stop eating just to save room for the pineapple upside down cake which was to DIE for. It was made fresh to order and served with homemade coconut ice cream(which I could of ate a whole bowl of alone lol) Overall I had a great experience here and while there was a little mishap with the mahi mahi at first they were quick to fix it and the manager even came by and apologized and took care of our dessert for us.\n"

When this happens, the Genghis Grill is a great solution.  The location is ideal: close enough to the mall for easy access; far away enough to park your car.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is clean and the food is fresh.

The actual meal is delicious, but sometimes I get impatient waiting for the fool in front of me to figure out whether he/she needs two or three carrots and spends two minutes figuring it out when all I want to do is eat!\\n\\nThe meat selection is great: seafood, steak, chicken, etc.  Plenty of veggies and sauces.  The trick is to fit as much uncooked food into the bowl.  That is the part I hate.

They had more of a selection than Mojo, which I appreciate--they had chocolate/vanilla, strawberry, banana, a couple of non-dairy choices, and so on.  I got strawberry with... cheesecake bits.

The worker did not give us cups to taste--he insisted on serving the yogurt to us himself, even for tasters.

He didn\'t really get what I was saying so he gave me a non-dairy toasted almond tester which I had to choke down to not be rude, but I hate non-dairy and I don\'t like almond so how do you think that made me feel?\\n\\nHe gave me another tester but it ran out onto his thumb, so I was grossed out.

The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy.

aS"This is a review for the pizza take out.\\n\\nThere are a few levels of pizza in the 602.\\n\\nTop tier is Pizzia Bianco, Cibo, Federal PIzza, et al. Those are NOT daily pizza choices, to me they are special occasions. \\n\\nEveryday kind of awesome pizza is Red Devil! Light years ahead of NYPD, Streets, etc. this place is legit! I highly recommend trying the pizza 'well done' which gets you more char on the crust. It's super good. This place also has really great wings, which surprised me. I ask for all drums, as those little wings aren't worth the trouble.\\n\\nKeep up the good work Red Devil. You are an oldie but a goodie.\n"

The inspiration came from talking with Jackie.  She's a dynamo!  I love the creative energy of the place.  There's something special going on there, and I recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same old restaurants, the same old foods, the same old.  I wish there were more places like this one in the valley.  You go, Jackie!\n"

aS"If there's German food or beer in the Phoenix area, you better bet your bottom dollar I'll know about it. \\n\\nI came here the day after it had opened and it was pretty slammed but we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat. While we waited, we were able to go over to the bar area and get ourselves a beer. The beer list is so great, it took me 5 minutes to decide which one to get first. I started with a Bell's draft for the wait (I know, I know - getting an American beer at this place? But Bell's is the bees knees and not many places have them on draft so Brat Haus gets a big star for that). \\n\\nOnce we got seated, the waiter came over and was extremely friendly and attentive. Every time I go to a restaurant shortly after they open, there's usually always some hiccups - spotty service, out of certain menu items, etc., but that wasn't the case at all! Everything seemed to be running smooth like they'd been open for months already. \\n\\nI got the spicy brat and the #5 Hefe for dinner. We also split fries and the pretzel. Hands down best pretzel I've ever had! \\n\\nThe ambiance is great, they have a beer menu to make even the most decisive person become an indecisive little girl, and the menu makes me want to keep coming back until I try everything. \\n\\nGo here.\n"

aS"I have been going to Sassy Glasses since I moved out here, about 4 or 5 years.\\n\\nI originally went for their frame selection - which is FANTASTIC!\\nI think of eyeglass frames as jewelry, and since I need them on my face 24/7, I always have a few pairs. (You wouldn't wear the same pair of earrings every day, would you? Well, ok, I wouldn't).\\n\\nThey definitely have the coolest frames in town - not necessarily the trendy boring 'names'; these are mostly European  and  Japanese cutting-edge style, but with enough 'interesting' basics for your everyday pair.\\n\\nThey are locally-owned, unlike most other shops in the Valley.\\nAnd to the previous reviewer who said they do not make their own lenses - well, I have news for you, I don't think I've EVER been to a shop that DID - even when I lived in NYC and Boston - at least for my prescription, which is a VERY complicated one, prisms and astigmatism and progressives and diopters. No matter where I've lived, my lenses ALWAYS take a week to order and receive.\\n\\nWhich brings me to - Ouida  and  Dan take the TIME to make sure they have my prescription and measurements CORRECT, unlike another nameless chain place I went to here in the Valley once (and will never return to).  They KNOW what they are doing. \\n\\nAnd they are really really nice, unlike some of the snobby shops so prevalent in the Valley. Have been in a few of those places to browse and I felt like I was being scoped out as to whether I could afford the frames or something! (and I try not to dress like a schlump). And I have no confidence that those places would get my lens correct, anyway.\\n\\nS.G. even made me a special pair of glasses to wear for when, as I normally do, sit with my laptop in my lap with the TV on, with the progressive line moved way up so I could see both.\\n\\nSassy Glasses IS a bit pricey, but I've discovered (see above) that you get what you pay for, at least on the lenses.\\nWhich is why I am a long-term customer.\n"

aS"Just cashed in our groupons for these bad boys a few weeks ago and had a great time, even if it did mean getting up before 8 a.m. on a Sunday. The staging site near 4 Peaks was easy to find and the company provided all the gear we'd need-- helmets, goggles, water, confidence, you name it. Luckily it had just rained the night before so instead of dust flying everywhere, we got splashed with mud. I'd rather get muddy and have some great views of the Valley sans pollution than ride through a constant cloud of dust, a la Pigpen.\\n\\nThe guide was super experienced and he let some of the faster riders up towards the front and the slower riders in the back so people could go at their own pace. We of course managed to get squashed in the middle behind a couple who couldn't decide whether they wanted to be speed racers or terrified school girls. That kinda put the kibosh on us really letting loose, but we still managed to pick up some speed along the way and really enjoy the trail. Since we weren't allowed to bring anything with us, the guide provided water and even took our pictures so we could download them later. \\n\\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend Stellar Adventures if you're looking for a little half-day trip or want to treat some out-of-town guests. It's a little pricey though, even with the groupons, but worth the splurge if you're up for a little action.\n"

aS"WHAT!? First off, why have I not left a review for this place. After all, it was Yelp that helped me find this supa-dupa-awesome office. Secondly, if you are looking for a new dentist, I HIGHLY suggest this award winning (litterally) dental office!\\n\\nMy history: My experience with the dentist hasn't been bad. I don't have many-to-any dental problems besides the fact that, like everyone else, I don't floss enough. I come from Ohio, where the waiting list always seems long to get in. Maybe, that was just one office.\\n\\nIn the middle of the Summer of 2011 I started having bleeding gums. Not just when brushing, but just gushing out (I know, graphic). I tried to tough it out, especially since I had an appointment with them about a week later. I woke up with massive blood clots in my mouth and so I called them at like 2am asking them to see if they could fit me in that same day.\\n\\nThey called me back as soon as they got into the office and said they had a cancelation for later that day to which I agreed to. I went in and it was quick and easy. I remember my mother filing out tons of paperwork but this was easy. Maybe times have changed a lot since then?\\n\\nIn any case, they got me in, and out, quickly when I arrived. They did a smal little clean for the area (I had a popcorn hull that had seriously impaled my gums) and signed me back up for a deeper and more extensive clean a few weeks after that. I did that, and even though they did a deep clean, they did a normal clean because I didn't need a deep clean.\\n\\nSince then I've had one other routine cleaning and I love it here. It is effortless.\\n\\nBonuses - they give you nice little shades to wear so that you're not blinded by the lights. Secondly, if there is an issue, they will take pictures of it and show you on the TV screen in full glory. You REALLY get the message then.\\n\\nI've dealth with Amber, Mary, Kathy, Kaysie, and Dr. Tom.\n"

They also offer laundry services as well as a computer room and free printing of airline boarding passes. \\n\\nIt looks like a new, clean property with contemporary interior design. Definitely worth the price, since other high end hotels would charge you three times as much for the same amenities. \\n\\nThe only weird thing is that the induction stovetop was rotated 90 degrees to save counter space (think of a photo that is rotated into portrait mode, rather than the landscape mode it was meant to be in).\\n\\nBut again, this place completely exceeded my expectations. Will definitely check this chain out next time I'm on travel.\n"

We didn't golf, we only stayed at the resort but this review isn't for the lodging; it's for the customer service. \\n\\nMy boyfriend's car battery died when we were on our way to dinner for our anniversary so he asked one of the staff members if they could help jump his car. Not only did the staff members help but when they realized the battery was completely dead, they helped remove the battery from the car, called Wal-Mart to make sure they had the same car battery so we could exchange it, shuttled us to Wal-Mart to pick up a new one, waited for us to exchange it, shuttled us back and installed the new battery for us. We didn't ask them to do anything other than help jump the car and it wasn't part of their job description to do any of the things they did but they did it and we couldn't have been more grateful. \\n\\nI'm so glad to see that there are still nice, genuine people around when others need a helping hand and I'm glad that they work at Orange Tree.

Although, I need to watch my weight I opted for sweet potato fries and they were excellent.\\n\\nThe burger was pricey but reasonable for the area and the Kobe beef, which I've had small portions of steak at other places and have paid a fortune for it.  \\n\\nNone the less, if you are there with friends, they will enjoy the view and the atmosphere.\n"

aS'"""Ok, let\'s start with what this hotel IS NOT:\\n\\nIt was officially NOT designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The architect of record is Albert McArthur, though he sought advice from FLW on the \\block system\\"""" that was stylishly used on the place to great effect. \\n\\nBut...there are obvious FLW influences throughout the property (especially in the main building lobby), and  (because FLW was a true ****) he said in public that this is McArthur\'s design while privately trying to take credit. That being said, I am an FLW fan and was lucky enough to spend a lot of time in one of his Paradise Valley homes...and this place has just enough \\""""vibe\\"""" to it to make anyone seeking the FLW feel be happy. Ok, I digress...\\n\\nIf you are looking for a sparkly clean, no cracks, built in 2012, all amenities resort...don\'t come here. This property is old school charm and elegance to the max. The thing it doesn\'t (and shouldn\'t) have is that extra \\""""something\\"""" preferred by 30-ish middle America d-bags that only comes with a hip spa that paints \\""""your lady\'s\\"""" toenails with American flags. Gross. \\n\\nThis property is for anyone who appreciates old school luxury. The main building\'s \\""""classic rooms\\"""" are throwbacks. They aren\'t huge, the windows aren\'t perfectly sealed, you can hear a bit of your posh neighbors\' conversations...but in this setting, wouldn\'t you want to?\\n\\nThe grounds are stunning and gorgeous and the staff was impeccable. \\n\\nI checked in and, after being asked twice if I was there for a special occasion, was given a free upgrade (to my already discounted December rate) to a suite overlooking the hills with a near private swimming pool. Problem was: it was TOO BIG for the two of us and we didn\'t want to be by the lovely tennis courts...we wanted the action. So they seamlessly transitioned us into one of the much smaller main building rooms. Bliss. \\n\\nWithin an hour of checking in to our new room, a knock came...behind the knock was a man delivering a bottle of sparkling wine, two flutes and a plate of six huge chocolate covered strawberries. Also on the tray was a note from the front desk guy (Frankie - you rock!) congratulating us on our celebration and expressing his hope that we liked the new room. Come on, that\'s a class move. \\n\\nAnyway, we immediately went downstairs, ordered a Monte Carlo and a perfect Manhattan, sat by the fire pit and watched the sun go down behind the gorgeous Camelback Mountain - all the time feeling more and more like Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn than a regular LA couple out to visit the \'rents. \\n\\nOld school luxe, charm and hospitality...low d-bag quotient.

I wanted to get a job in the building so I could eat my lunch outside there every day.  So I walked into the building and... nothing.  No signs of Dagwood's.  Then I realized that right in front of me was an area w/ small tables, a sofa and some nice sitting chairs facing a tv.  I had to ask someone when they walked out if that was Dagwood's.  It was.  So I walked in and went to the side to find that the entrance for Dagwood's is officially at the back of the building - but even there I couldn't find a sign.  \\n\\nA really amazing selection of sandwiches.  They had SO many options.  And they do breakfast - gotta love that.  The sandwich was good and all, but my favorite part was walking outside to eat (I love Phoenix! - My first time here was November and I've eaten outside in December and January too!) where I found some round shaded tables where I could eat lunch while looking out at their fake-lake with ducks swimming back and forth.  Not bad for 5 minutes away from a very industrial part of Tempe.  If you work in the area, it's definitely worth a stop.\n"

I appreciate this from a viewpoint of someone who tries to eat healthily, yet allows herself the occasional indulgence.

The staff was friendly, welcoming, and my room was amazing.\\n \\nI was surprised by getting a nice and comfortable room on a higher floor and the view from the balcony was breathtaking. I stood on it every evening and morning. Bring a camera! The beds were even better...the pillows, heavenly and super soft. I slept better in that bed than I have in my comfy one at home. I was later pleased to hear that they sell them on their website. Smart. I had to get up early to work at a conference hosted in the resort that week, but if I could have stayed in bed longer, I wouldn't have stopped hugging the feathers out of these amazing pillows. \\n\\nMy favorite things about the resort (besides the awesome beds) were the saloon and the Deseo restaurant. May have been one of the best dining spots I have been in a while. With phenomenal wines on the menu, dishes filled with a melange of delicious flavors and fresh ingredients, and their bread is some of the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend going on a nice dinner date here or out on a business dinner. You won't be disappointed! The saloon below the lobby is also a great spot to grab some drinks and enjoy some bourbon or scotch. \\n\\nIf you are a golf enthusiast, they have a large golf course on site. By far, I will say that the fire pit outside is THE best amenity of this resort. With comfy large couches surrounding the fire put, drink service available, blankets there to keep you warm, this is the perfect spot to lay back and relax with friends in the evening. Everyone should have a fire pit. At 5pm every day for an hour, the hotel has a very talented Scottish bagpiper who wanders around the fire pit and golf course, entertaining those outside with some great music. \\n\\nI would love to stay here again sometime!

aS'Great outdoors store that has just about everything.....I have never bought anything here, but has been a great place to take people to sight see.  I have even taken children here to check out the huge fish tanks, stuffed animals(real ones) and all the unique gear that goes along being a hunter, fisher, or outdoors type.  \\n\\nI am sure the prices are not the best, but you go here for the huge selection of unique tools and equipment that is special to these recreational hobbies.  \\nAnyways if I was an outdoors type, hunted, or fished, or just curious on taking up a new hobby this is a place to check out.\n'

aS'This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ! Fresh fish, good portions, and great service. A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce! Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like. I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice.\\n\\nThe staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars. As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs. There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right? Check this place out and judge for yourself!\n'

aS"i do love me some mini golf, even though i am not that good. lol. but hey its all for fun right??!! it was pretty crowded for a saturday but then again its getting warmer so i didnt expect any less from it. prices aren't too bad. and there are 2 different courses to choose from i believe. it seemed even more crowded because of the water park, so if you dont like screaming children running around then stay away! the course we chose was a little slow but it got moving once everyone got their games going. usually when i play i dont keep score because im not that competitive, but my boyfriend kept score and that only made me want to kick his butt, but that didnt happen because i get in this mindset of how im gonna totally win and yeah. lol. but i cant wait to go back again. this place is definitely good for parties too. they have a pretty good size arcade inside as well as a food place to get like hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, etc. the water park also looked fun and since i hear it gets to be like 120 degrees here in the summer time that definitely sounds like a good plan.\n"

You\'ll need to check the menu before you order to make sure they have everything you\'re used to. While most Chinese restaurants all pick from the same playcard, Tott\'s bills itself as an \\asian diner\\"""" and so standbys like moo shu pork are absent. To flesh things out, they add a handful of curries and some other pan-asian dishes you wouldn\'t normally see.

(I make sure to order it \\""""not crispy\\"""" since the shards-of-chicken approach is UNpleasant to me, which they abide by perfectly.) When it comes out fresh and uncrispy, there is no greater. It is just a bit spicy and has some red chile-type things in the sauce, so be prepared, or ask them to tone it down, but it comes out fresh, and hot, and amazing. \\n\\nTheir chow mein is also fantastic. It\'s chow mein as it should be: soft noodles, not dry at all, and with tons of vegetables. I have them throw in shrimp, and they always include a big portion of just-right cooked shrimp.\\n\\nI usually tap things out with an order of their great crab/cheese puffs. They\'re a bit light on the \\""""crab\\"""" side, and might be \\""""krab\\"""", but the flavor is amazing and their sweet and sour sauce is fantastic. Some of my favorite cheese puffs, pretty much ever.\\n\\nIf you dare order the pork rolls, a word of warning: they are an entire meal in and of themselves. They are the about as thick as your arm and there are two of them, served with sweet  and  sour mixed with spicy mustard. They are so big that they have to rubber band the foam container.\\n\\nThe portions are huge for dinner, and at about $11 each, you EASILY have two meals out of them.\\n\\nTake the time to hit up this place for a different take on great chinese food.

aS"I love this library nestled up in North Scottsdale. The architecture is beautiful and the exterior surroundings are nice as well. There is plenty of seating inside and seating outside as well. The exterior seating is under a covered area to shield you from the sun.  I really like the tables inside the facility that are right next to the tall glass windows because you get that natural lighting and get a chance to peak outside as a break from whatever you at the library for.\\n\\nThis library, as probably most if not all, features free wireless internet. There are also many HP Touchscreen computer terminals available. The monitors are really large. I'm not sure how big exactly, but it's probably more than 20 inches. There is also a circular, central seating area as you walk through the main entrance. The seats are in a circular pattern with little tables on the side that you can swing around that are big enough to sit a laptop on.\\n\\nThere are also other features to this library, but what I mentioned earlier are what I'm more familiar with. I visit this library every now and then on the weekends. It's never incredibly busy, but I'm not sure what it's like during the rest of the week. The hours are kind of limited on the weekend because their closed on Sundays.\n"

aS"07/15/07\\n\\nThe quintessential New York Deli...or at least what I am told one should be (having never visited New York).  \\n\\nSolid, satisfying, hot and cold sandwiches with a variety of potato and salad (macaroni, etc.) side options.  Cafeteria style, so know what you want by the time you get to the counter.  It's a great place to go on Sunday morning and read the paper while you enjoy a carved sandwhich.  Of course, there is nothing heathy about any of this food, but it's solidly tasty and satisfying.  Slightly pricey (hot dog special is a good economic choice), but the atmosphere is relaxing, always clean, consistent quality, and they have free self-service water, so you don't have to bother with getting back into line if you're still thirsty.  \\n\\nWhat makes it unique is its authenticity and distinction from chain and fastfood stores.  It's not particularly interesting food, just good to satisfy your deli cravings.  Plus, I believe it's locally owned with gives it actual personality.\\n\\nCome on Sunday and then walk down to PetCo.

The outdoor patio is ideal for the warm desert air; and the pink glow of the couches look inviting for a couple's first date. \\n\\nOf course, tapas are best shared in groups. And in our group of four, we cleared: escargot in garlic butter, deep-fried cauliflower with aioli, roasted artichoke, fish and chips, pork taquitos, flatiron steak, lamb kabob, duck confit, and beef carpaccio.

I live in West Mesa now so it was a long drive for us but we were both good and hungry. \\nWe were warmly greeted and well served after we found it (tricky). \\nThe ambience is best described as warm and cozy - pretty intimate. I counted the total number of seats in the place: 28. \\nTJ ordered the pork entree with a side of carrots and the creamed corn. I ordered the pasta dish because I saw it arrive at someone else's table and was intrigued. \\nI had a white sangria and TJ got the blood orange mojito. \\n\\nThe entrees were delicious, truly. Mine was piping hot, fresh, just the right amount of creaminess and I was surprised at how perfectly cooked the onions and peppers in my dish were - still crisp without being under cooked. The pasta, too, was right on. The chicken and the chorizo - a little chewy. \\n\\nTJ's portion didn't fill him entirely. He helped with my dish and I still had a box to bring home.  \\nHis mojito was truly wonderous - must find out how to do that at home. My sangria was just okay. It had little apple slivers in it that I found unappealing due to aged texture. I'd stick to the mojitos in the future and would only go back for happy hour pricing because with those four ordered items and our $30 Groupon credit, we still spent $43.00. \\n\\nI'm not sure about the price/quality/quantity ratio. It would have been nice, too, to have some fanciful little breads or crackers or chips on the table before the entrees came out. Didn't happen. I'd say don't go starved and don't bring kids.\n"

Pulling up I noticed they advertised real charcoal grilling and sure enough they cook everything to order on a charcoal grill behind the counter.   We were not asked how we wanted the items cooked, but the man cooking the food had been interacting with us, so I asked him to make my two hot dogs well done and he made the perfectly.  The toppings for the hot dogs and burgers looked fresh.  We ordered the macaroni and cheese which was also delicious.

I got the small bowl and still had enough left over for another meal. \\n\\nThe ingredients are spread out in a buffet. You go along the buffet and fill your bowl with whatever you like. I chose chicken, lots of veggies and rice noodles. The trick, from what I can tell is to shove as much food in your bowl and then using the handy wax paper they leave out for you, smash it down into your bowl so you can fit even more in! At the end of the buffet are tubs of different sauces and a chalkboard with  instructions for different combinations. I am a bit of a traditionalist and mixed up the Mongolian sauce. You then hand your embarrassingly heaping bowl to the cooks who quickly stir fry it for you and then hand it back.\\n\\nCan I just say oh my God was this delicious without sounding vain because really I sort of cooked it myself? The ingredients were super fresh!  There is also a small bar with soup and rice, but I wouldn't waste my time with those if I were you! The BBQ was delicious and fun to prepare!\n"

Typically my parents would go to Outback or Olive Garden but I asked if we could please switch it up  and  my mom told me to pick a place. I had received a postcard from Ocean Prime for $25 off  and  thought why not? It must have been meant to be because my mom got one too  and  said she was thinking about trying it out also. I called  and  made reservations for Saturday the 26th at 7pm. \\n\\nThe place was packed when we arrived, literally every table was filled. The design was very sleek  and  modern, with neon blue lighting. We were seated at a table near the bar  and  Rebecca was our server, she was awesome! \\n\\nFresh bread  and  butter were immediately brought out, yummy. We started off with the colossal shrimp cocktail  and  half order of oysters. My hubby  and  I shared the shrimp cocktail, 3 HUGE pieces of shrimp with dry ice underneath, very cool  and  very tasty. My parents shared the oysters  and  loved them. My dad is a scotch man so he ordered a couple johnnie walker's with club soda. I am a vodka girl so I decided to try the berries  and  bubbles cocktail. OMG was this cocktail delicious, the pieces of fruit  and  dry ice sent it over the top, I loved it so much I had 2. My hubby went with the tequila cocktail  and  thought it was just ok, I knew he should have stuck with his usual captain  and  coke. \\n\\nOn to the entrees. My dad ordered the 7oz filet mignon (med-rare), my mom ordered the salt n pepper tuna (WELL DONE! WTF, WHO DOES THAT? I TOLD HER NOT TO BUT SHE INSISTED, UGH.), my hubby ordered the sea scallops  and  I ordered the twin lobster tails. For sides we all shared the sauteed wild mushrooms  and  jumbo asparagus with hollandaise. We all sampled each others entrees  and  everything was amazing, except my mom's tuna since she ruined it by ordering it well freakin done, but my lobster tails were the crowd favorite. Both side dishes were delicious as well. We were all so full but decided to get dessert since we were celebrating. We chose the chocolate peanut butter pie. Damn was it good, somehow we all managed to make room  and  had to keep ourselves from licking the plate clean. \\n\\nI brought that $25 off postcard I mentioned earlier  and  so did my mom. I thought they wouldn't except both at one table, but since we were paying with 2 cards they let us use 1 on each card, awesome! So with the promotional $50 off our total came to about $230 (not including tip). A tad overpriced, (which is why I only gave 4 stars) so I don't see us coming often, but we all thoroughly enjoyed our dinner so for a special occasion it's worth the splurge!\n"

aS"Best description of this place would be Chick-fil-A play land meets Pump-It-Up.  My kids love this place.  They're moving and climbing non-stop whenever we are there, so I love it.  We had their birthday parties there about 6 months ago.  Overall, I think the kids had fun. The only downside to the birthday parties is that you can't have a private party unless you do it afterhours, which is sort of late for young kids.   I think its $9 for an open session.  My only other complaint is the quality and price of the food.  I think its Sam's Club food.  They charge $2.00 for a not so great hot dog.  Also, I think they need to vacuum more often; the floor appeared to be pretty dirty.  They say they vacuum everyday, but I'm not so sure about that.\n"

I\'ll find something to make and some way to sport it if it kills me.  \\n\\nWhat I DO know though (well, now I know, anyway) is that it\'s not superduper smart to go to SAS without an honest to god pattern that you\'re ready to cut and sew in your hand.  There are just too many luxurious fabrics in beautiful prints and colors to play with, every aisle you walk down.  Sure, there\'s some junky stuff, but whatevs, just keep going and before you know it you\'re fingering the prettiest, shiniest, brightest silk or brocade or taffeta that you\'ve ever seen, and you\'re imagining the ballgown that you\'ll make out of it.  Hey, one never knows when one will need a ballgown, so get off my nuts!  And just in case you do, there\'s plenty tiaras and whatnot to complete the look.\\n\\nThey do carry lots of notions, some too many and some not enough. There are BINS of loose buttons, if you care to sort through and find all the matching buttons you need.   I don\'t think I saw a really great selection of laces and ribbons and other trims though.  The thread is super cheap, but the color selection is a little thin and I\'m not sure if it\'s any good (most of them had \\family dollar\\"""" stamped on them, and at .20 a pop, who knows).  Needle selection is next to nil, and the ones that they did supposedly have were almost all sold out.

aS"We are huge fans of Cartel Coffee Lab. \\n\\nThe Mrs. is a coffee nut so we drive all over in search of the best cup and the best beans. It is one of our two very favorite places.\\n\\nFirst of all, their coffee beans...  We are firm believers in getting beans that are locally roasted. We've subscribed to the belief that flavor is lost  as you get too far out from the roasting. Cartel roasts their own and does a ridiculous job. They do a great decaf and a number of interesting and excellent regular varietals. If you don't already buy locally roasted beans, do yourself a favor and give Cartel's a shot.\\n\\nAs far as their in-house coffee drinks, the Cartel folk are pretty much obsessive in their pursuit of excellence. You won't find the million varieties of crazy drinks they now do in many coffeehouses but  you will find excellent drinks done by people who are serious about what they are doing. I for one, am happy to roll with their recommendations when I am there and enjoy my whole milk, leaded latte with agave syrup. \\n\\nThey also have a Clover machine (which many say does the best brewed coffee) which does 1 cup at a time. You will also see the beans individually packaged for the clover right nearby. One of the philosophies the folks there have expressed is that you want to get the beans brewing as soon after grind as possible. They've even minimized the number of steps you have to take to do this.\\n\\nCartel Coffee Lab is also a very, very cool place. It's kind of tucked away in a strip mall off University back behind Eastside Records. They've taken this industrial space and kept some of that which adds to the charm and also have put very cool local art throughout. Some of it changes which is also nice. They've also fabricated some things like the bar and space dividers which give it a neat look. Their roaster also sits out in full view. In addition to all this, they always have great music playing. Something about sitting down on one of those couches with their background music instantly relaxes me.\\n\\nAnd the last bonus for me is that with them being so obsessive about coffee, they also sell some great equipment in the front. We bought our burr grinder from them and couldn't be happier.\\n\\nAbout the only thing about Cartel that is disappointing to us is that they have recently stopped pulling decaf espresso shots. From what I understand, this happened because they switched their grinder system out for a better one. I hope at some point, they decide to grab one of their own burr grinders for sale and reverse this change.\\n\\nIf you haven't tried Cartel Coffee Lab yet, it's a must.\n"

Everything I tasted was delicious, especially the Chicken Quesidilla. Normally I would skip a chicken Quesidill on almost any menu, but I am so glad I didnt this time. Just the right mix of seasoned Chipotle Chicken and Cheese in a huge folded and grilled tortilla, with sour cream. This is by far the very best restaurant quesidilla in town. Everything served was great, and raves about the food came frome everyone.\\n\\nThey have great drink specials during happy hour as well, including 1/2 price margaritas and special priced beers. It's the tequilla selection that is special though. It's an amazing selection of some of the best tequillas in the world. You can even try some tequilla flights!\\n\\nInside the place is funky/cool, super clean, with some really cool art and lighting.\\nIn Old Town There are some real GEMS and a few DUDS when it comes to mexican food, but Cien Agaves might just be the very best choice for Mexican food in Scottsdale.\\n\\nI MUST SAY TO MY FELLOW YELPERS---GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n"

aS'If you are looking for authentic goumet Italian food, this is not the place to go! The food is simple but tastes great. Good for large groups as the place is huge with many different rooms to be seated in. They offer a complete dinner: drink, bread, salad, entree,  and  ice cream for around $11. I had spaghetti  and  meatballs, pesto ranch on my salad, very tatsy- the hot sourdough was awesome and a scoop of spumoni ice cream. They offer whole wheat pasta, and gluten free pasta options.

First of all, I love the fact that they have plenty of free parking; even on a Sat night.  The restaurant is actually much larger than I thought with the huge back room where we were seated.  \\n\\nSince it is a German restaurant, we were ready to try their beer but didn't have a clue as to which one...our waitress took delivery of bringing us samples to see which one we favor.  That was very nice of her.  After ordering the beer, we had the imported pretzel, Paprika Schnitzel, Sauerbraten.  \\n\\n*Pretzel = YUM!  It was crusty on the outside and very chewy inside.\\n*Paprika Schnitzel = very much like Japanese cutlet.  Not as flavorful..\\n*Sauerbraten = we tried it because we heard that it takes 4 days.  Honestly, the only thing we could taste was the thick sauce, the meat was kinda tough, and the pasta was bland.  On the upside, I liked the red cabbage.\\n\\nOverall, it was a great experience with live German music, great beer and pretzel.  \\nBut would we go back?...probably not.\\n\\n*Ambiance = Wonderful!  It doesn't really feel like AZ.\\n*Food = mediocre...we prefer more flavor\\n*Area = good.  in the middle of old town Glendale.\\n*Service = great.  we had a wonderful waitress who took very good care of us.\n"

The chicken sandwich is very similar to the breakfast sandwich at Olive  and  Ivy.  The gorgonzola chicken salad is the same salad I've had before at Sauce.

The beef, since it is cooked rare, is very tender, and because it is marinated in a sweet vinegary type marinate, you don't really notice the rawness of the meat.  The sausages were kind of reminiscent of Chinese sausage, except thicker and more savory/salty.  The sausage is red like Chinese sausage is, except it is more of a sweet/sour type sausage rather than mostly sweet like Chinese sausage is.  \\n\\nService was adequate, although they ran out of diet coke that day so I couldn't get my fizzy caffeine fix for the day.\n"

aS"Saw the Hey Joe! food truck parked at the Mesa Arts Center food court for the Asian Festival and had to try it out!  I got the Lechon plate ($8.50), which included about 4 pieces of deep fried pork belly with crispy skin, a scoop of rice, and some pickled veggies (Carrots, radish, red bell pepper).  The order took a little time to be made, as there was a backup of orders from some customers wanting a lot of extras (Like 8 cups of soy sauce, or 6 to-go boxes for their plates), so the food wasn't out in quick time like I was expecting for a food truck.  The staff were very friendly though, and it's nice that they offer credit card for you to pay (No minimum order), and will send you your receipt through your e-mail.  \\n\\nThe lechon was very rich and flavorful.  It had a mix of juicy pork and crispy skin from being deep fried.  Although they give you just a few pieces, it is a pretty heavy tasting dish, and it was nice to add the rice and vegetables as lighter sides to balance out the meat.  Although very tasty, the price was a little high, considering I can get a pound of lechon for the same price at Heavenly Bakeshop in Chandler.\\n\\nOverall, it's nice to see some more uncommon foods here in the Phoenix area such as Filipino cuisine, and I'd like to visit their food truck again to try some more dishes.\n"

You can\'t go wrong on either the basic or premier sausages, but if you\'re unsure what to try go for a sweet/spicy combo. Like the spicy brat and a sweet topping, or sweet brat and spicy toping. If you like sauerkraut, it\'s all homemade (like the sausages) so give it a try. If you don\'t like sauerkraut, you\'re a strange person and should probably not go to a bratwurst house.

We had the filets, which were cooked to perfection. However, the meat did not have the excellent taste that we expected.  We had mashed potatoes (very tasty) and green beans.  The salads were generous and fresh.  We had flourless chocolate cake which was amazing.

I can't verify that, I don't even remember who told me that, maybe I read it some where.  Don't know if it is true or not. What I do know is that Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  Their pizza is consistently good.  Thin-Crisp and delicious.  I have had pasta's and salads there as well.

aS"I decided to visit this place after reading about the owner in an article in the Arizona Republic. In my old job a coworker who sat next to me always brought in chocolate croissants for breakfast to share with me (from Albertson's bakery). This is how I got hooked on them. Then after several trips to Paris and enjoying the chocolate croissants there it was hard to go back to Albertson's chocolate croissants (last time I checked, however, Albertson's no longer makes chocolate croissants anymore). Anyway, my worries are now over as this is the best croissant I have ever had. Right here in the valley. My husband and I stopped by the other day and got the chocolate croissants while they were still warm. As we were driving away we decided we had to have more and turned around and went back for more. On our second stop we also purchased the Raspberry/Rose macaroon and, this too, was the best I've ever had. I haven't had any of their sandwiches or salads as of yet, but I will be going back for more croissants and macaroons for sure.\n"

I have enough trouble choosing amongst 12 flavors, so this was just clearly going to be the biggest challenge of my night. I went with the little girl's faves - nocciola e amaretto. Delizioso. My date went for fruit - chocolate coconut and raspberry (lampone). Also excellent. The flavors are rich and the gelato creamy. Their store is fairly large and bright.

For my main course I choose a seared Irish salmon that was served with leeks, tomato gratin, and a pea puree.

The buns are soft, but hold together well and the meat is charred, but not crusty and overdone.\\nAre there better burgers in the Phoenix area?...I'd have to say yes. Are there better drive-thru burgers in Phoenix?...I don't think so. \\nLucky boy is terrific...fresh, tasty, inexpensive (my meal was under $5.00), fast and the people at Lucky Boy are just extremely nice folks. Let's all do our  part and make them busier!\n"

aS"Somehow this unassuming place in a strip mall in Arizona is one of the better Thai restaurants I've been to.  I've been here numerous times, and each time the food is consistently delicious.  One of the best Pad Thai dishes I've ever had, and most of the curries have had have also been quite good (save the Green Curry, of which I've had better)\\n\\nLike most good Asian restaurants, you should come here for the food and not the decor/ambiance/service/whatever.  On my last visit the decor appeared to be in the process of being updated from it's previous hole-in-the-wall look, but wasn't quite there yet.  I've never had a problem with the service -- they're very friendly and efficient but they don't fall all over themselves for you either, which is fine with me.

They have a wide variety of flavors that are both fruity and creamy. In addition, they have several toppings to top off a delicious cup of fro yo!

I've had their sushi (Tiger roll is my current favorite here), their chinese combo lunch plates (which are outrageously cheap), and their fried fish hawaiian combos. Everything has been great and way more food than I can eat.\\n\\nTheir service is great as well. They bring the food to your table if you are eating in and start you off with crispy wonton strips and sweet  and  sour sauce. Then your food comes, fresh from their grill, and it is just wonderful. They even offer to top off your drinks for you, and bring you anything else you need.\\n\\nYou could come here for lunch every day, try something new, and never run out of choices or variety. On top of that, their hours are amazing, something like 10:30 AM to 8PM. Early lunches to late dinners, and they deliver.\\n\\nI can't think of anything to complain about. Maybe they could offer soup. Really. That's my wish, not even a complaint, because I probably could not eat wontons, soup, AND a dish. But I would try.\\n\\n--- UPDATE - They DO have soup.

It is a very new store, so the shelves aren't full yet, they're trying to figure out what the customers want.

aS'"""After writing my initial review, I was contacted by the manager of Fresh Wasabi (Billy). He asked that I come back in and order the same thing I ordered on my last visit. He explained that he would cover the bill, and that he wanted prove that the first bad experience was not the normal experience a customer would have. I took him up on his offer last night. I went in and ordered to the best of memory, what we had ordered on our last visit. I ordered 2 pieces of nigiri, a california roll, and their \\Snow White\\"""" Roll. After I ordering I remembered exactly what I disliked on my first visit. Originally the size of the piece of fish on top of the nigiri was quite small. This time, however, if anything, the piece of fish was too big (a good problem to have in my opinion). Next came the california roll. It is a standard california roll, nothing to complain about, very average. The snow white roll is basically a spicy tuna roll topped with a small piece of white tuna and roe with a mustard soy sauce. I didn\'t care for this roll very much, but it was executed well. I remembered it from the first visit, and I was just not a huge fan of the flavor combination. Finally as an addendum to our order. Billy had us try a new roll. It contained a fried jalepeno and crab in the middle and was topped with siracha and a wasabi mayo. When I read the description, I was thinking it was going to be very spicy. I did not find it extremely spicy though. I found it a little more appealing than the \\""""Snow White\\"""" roll. It had a similar taste to biting into deconstructed burger (Siracha = Ketchup, wasabi mayo = mayo, rice = bun, crab = meat). Overall, I will probably end up coming back in to the restaurant. I will most likely avoid the specialty rolls as I didn\'t particularly care for either of them and they are normally $10+ on the menu. However, I would probably sit at the sushi bar and order nigiri and the more basic rolls after explaining to the sushi chef that I prefer big cuts of fish on my nigiri. Billy went over and above to show that my first experience was not the norm and I appreciate the pride he showed in his restaurant. I would come back for lunch and for a staff that takes pleasing the customer seriously."""""""\n'

You can enjoy the appropriately named \\Oasis\\"""" relaxing on their lounge chairs and couches, or get there early if you want to commandeer one of the beds.  The folks at the Clarendon didn\'t miss much: the d\\u00e9cor is modern and the atmosphere relaxed. They\'ve usually got a pretty good soundtrack piped in above and an even better one below the surface thanks to the nifty underwater speakers (We\'ve caught the themes to Hawaii Five-O, The Love Boat, and even Jaws). Plus there are free towels, pool toys, beach balls, and a very convenient poolside bar (or friendly waiter on slower weekends). Speaking of the bar, do yourself a favor and order a margarita. Better yet - a pitcher of margaritas. Mmm. The only thing they could improve would be the hot tub - although it can fit 50 people (yes, we\'ve tested it) they keep the temperature set to lukewarm bath.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, we began to panic as the weather started to turn cooler and we foresaw our pool fun coming to an end. Much to our delight, we found the rooftop lounge opening up for the fall season. Although this is more of a work in progress, the potential is there for an excellent night on (or above) the town - you can\'t beat the view. You never really know what you\'re going to get at the C though - We\'ve been there on nights when we were the only patrons and others when we couldn\'t even get upstairs.  For those of you that previously noted the capacity limitations don\'t worry! We\'re told that renovations are planned to raise the railings (and thus increase the capacity). Keep your eye on this place!\\n\\nOh, and if you\'ve got a good excuse to be downtown, you might as well book a room.

I had the edamame dumplings and the farmer's market salad for lunch. The dumplings were more like ravioli with a bit of truffle oil - some of the best I've had. I really would have been happy with an entire plate of these for my meal! The salad was fresh and crisp, and an interesting combination of ingredients - golden beets, kale, romaine, manchego cheese, avocado, with a light champagne vinagerette. \\n\\nLater, I ordered the thai dumplings and steelhead salmon for dinner. The dumplings were good, but not as good as the edamame dumplings from lunch. The salmon was cooked perfectly - good sear on the outside, and moist on the inside - all on top of a bed of beets, greens, and red quinoa. \\n\\nPrice is a bit of a drawback here, but I suppose you pay for what you get when it comes to the calibur of the ingredients.

If I had the dough and lived closer to this amazing little nirvana-esque studio, this would be my place. Some studios get too corny with their faux new-agey vibe....but here I feel like the vibe and ' heart' is organic and unforced.  Brooke the owner is an AMAZING instructor. She provides useful information about the transformative effects of each pose and it pushes me to complete each section with dignity, grace, willpower and determination like no other. I've never advanced so rapidly (in as short as four sessions) both mentally and physically. I also went during August  and it helped me tolerate the insane mind melting heat with more aplomb than in past summers. You know they say that once you go Bikram, you never go back-ram ( I know that was corny with a 'k'). But seriously try it.\n"

aS'"""One of the guys down at Cycle Gear in Mesa had recommended this bar to me several weeks ago, he gave me the impression that it was a motorcycle bar of sorts, so I hopped on my bike to check it out last Friday night around 11pm.\\n\\nFirst timers take note:  This place is to easy to zip past, esp. if you\'re looking for it westbound off of Thomas.  Print a map or at least know the cross street name, N 68th street.\\n\\nAnyway, when I finally found the place and pulled into the parking lot, there was not another motorcycle in sight.  So much for it being a motorcycle bar, maybe that\'s on certain nights.\\n\\nWhen I stepped inside and looked around, half the (mostly female) contingent of people at the actual bar turned around and stared, I guess a motorcycle riding man is somewhat of a novelty?  I found a seat at the back side of the horseshoe bar, noticed that Guiness was on tap, so I ordered a black and tan for $4.50.  I immediately started chatting with a friendly tatooed local next to me, Megan.  \\n\\nWe talked about restoring motorcycles  and  cars, and how she got into working as a female bouncer.  She told me a story of some poor guy who\'s forehead was actually cracked open against the wall \\on accident\\"""" while she was trying to haul him out of the bar in a headlock.  That conversation ended within approx 30 seconds of me casually mentioning the fact that I had a girlfriend.   Which was OK because they had \\""""The Big Lebowski\\"""" playing on a couple of flat screens in close captioning, and I fuckin\' love that movie.\\n\\nInside the TT Roadhouse there is a lot of wood, as is cellulose.  It is pretty small, and reminded me of another tiny bar, the Tiki Ti in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.  Only with more of a pirate/twin peaks feel.   I also noticed that there were in fact, several old timey pictures of motorcycles on the walls, hooray, I guess that makes it a motorcycle bar after all. \\n\\nFor my second drink I asked the other bartender (i.e. not \\""""The Predator\\"""") what he recommended from the tiki style Friday night $3 drink specials.  He was kind of an ass about it, saying \\""""I don\'t recommend any of them....because I\'m a guy\\"""", or some shit like that.  I let it slide and just ordered a Pabst Blue Ribbon in a can for $2.  \\n\\nThe bar wasn\'t ever packed, about 2/3 full when I got there, but more people started rolling in past midnight.  The ratio was easily half male/female. If you were looking for a hookup, there were maybe 2 or 3 \\""""doable\\"""" girls there, tops.\\n\\nThe men\'s room was flooded, the urinal looked like it hadn\'t been flushed in the past 30 uses, and the toilet was clogged too.  I even tried to unclog it using the plunger there, but no dice.  I hate having to take a piss is some unflushed toilet and have the pisswater spray back at me, fuckin gross.  The only good thing is that they had soap and water and paper towels to wash up with.  \\n\\nWhen I finished washing up and looked in the mirror I noticed that I had been wearing my reflective Halo band around my neck since I walked in the bar.  (The Halo is this reflective band you put around your helmet so drivers can see you at night.)  Man did I feel like a toolbox.  Is that why everybody was looking at me like that when I walked in?  Maybe they\'re wondering, \\""""Is some kind of trendy new scarf, no wait, wtf is that guy wearing around his neck?!\\"""".   Nobody had said anything the previous 20 minutes, including the girl I had been talking to, maybe they were too loaded to care, or just trying to be polite.\\n \\nWhile saddling up on my bike outside, a girl on the, ah, \\""""tipsy\\"""" side was pushed over to me by her gay manfriend, whereupon I was solicited for a ride.   She said she really wanted a ride despite the fact that she had never ridden on a motorcycle before.  I tried to explain that:  buzzed driver + drunk 1st time passenger + no passenger helmet = almost certain disaster, but I\'m not sure if it really registered.  Her friend announced \\""""wait, wait let\'s get a look at his asssss when he gets on the bike\\""""   I happily obliged and took off into the night."""""""\n'

aS"Only had the lunch special (2 slices and a drink).  Had it a few times and it's a great value and a decent slice of pizza.  They don't skimp on the toppings either.\\n\\nI used to eat at Lucky's in North Peoria all the time and this place really reminds me them.  Thin crispy crust with a nice amount of crunch and chew.  Nothing like the pre-made garbage you get at the chains.  You can tell this dough is made fresh.\\n\\nDon't expect high end fixtures or fancy toppings, just good basic pizza at a good price.\n"

aS"I like Mexican food and this place did not disappoint! My family and I were in Phoenix for only a few hours and my husband's cousin suggested coming here for dinner. The outside wall art was an added bonus. Best dinner suggestion ever! Although there was not a 'kid's menu' and hardly any food to choose from, we were able to get my daughter a few corn tortillas and chicken to make her own version. Problem solved. Our meals were fantastic and the sangria was the best I'd ever had!\n"

aS'This place is amazing. cheap but great food and really nice staff.  the place has a great atmosphere with old Chicago stuff.  Their hot dogs are great. I personally love the chili dog.  The sliders are great too and  the french fries are the type that are amazing when warm but are still amazing when there cold.  You can also get authentic cheese fries, which accordingly to my girlfriend (a Chicago native) is nearly impossible in Phoenix. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. We go to it at least 3 times a month.\n'
p1222
aS"My beloved boyfriend had suggested this place one night for dinner and I love trying new things. The ambiance is dark but lit with many candles and chandeliers to enduce a sense of culinary romance. The mosaic brick-tiled wall accent is a nice touch as well. The staff seemed knowledgeable but a bit robotic for my taste. To start, we ordered a bottle of the El Coto Rioja Crianza 2007. We then moved on to the tableside mixed guacamole which is yummy but probably worth your calories for the whole week! The salsa they give you with the chips was super disappointing. I felt like we were dipping our chips into a bowl of cheap store bought watered down tomato sauce. Our appetizer we shared was the Colorado lamb with the rice and lamb chirizo. It was very impressive in presenation and flavor profile. I was blown away that I felt maybe we shouldn't have gotten an entree and just had more of the lamb. Our entree that we shared was the Chirizo Porchetta (pork shoulder, chorizo, fresh rosemary, cotija, white bean puree, sweet garlic crema w/chirizo gastrique). It was pretty tasty, however, we both agreed that the pork was a bit dry.\\n\\nTo summarize, atmosphere is a 5, cleanliness 5, food/wine 4, service 3/4 and yes I would recommend this place to others.\n"

aS"Even though I live closer to a different Asian market, I take the time to drive a little further for the great selection and prices at Lee Lee.  They have just about anything you would need to make any Asian or Asian-inspired dish.  And it's not just strictly Asian food.  They have aisles for Indian products, European and British products, and Hispanic products, among others.\\n\\nThere is so much to find here. A decent produce section caters mostly to those looking for Asian vegetables.  The bakery aisle is stocked with an assortment of trucked-in (not made in-house) breads and a few sweets.  At the back of the store you can find a seafood counter and meat section that has both fresh and frozen meats.  Again, I cannot emphasize enough how reasonable most of the prices are!  On the other side of the store is huge freezer section full of items too numerable to list.  In the center you can find aisles full of kitchen gadgets, pots, pans, steamers, dishes, and even a beer/liquor section.  A small restaurant and snack counter are located near the entrance of the store, but I have yet to try either of them.\\n\\nThis is just a great overall Asian market.  I can easily spend over an hour just browsing the aisles.  So glad I found this place!\n"

aS"What I like about Windsor is its unpretentious style. At the same time it has a great style, great decor for a small neighborhood restaurant. I like that they have smaller portions (right portions.. don't be afraid you will leave hungry). Patio is nice and interior is connected with Churn- a place where you get your cookies, ice cream and some fun stuff. I really like the bar area. It is large and old fashion in the good sense of the word. what I would like to see at Windsor is seasonal menu. changing 4 times a year. After eating there 10 times you kind of run out of options.\n"

aS"The Vig was great!  We ordered the following-\\nApps:\\nChips and Guac-- YUM, good chips\\nSweet Potato Fries-- good but not great\\nSpinach Dip- v. good\\n\\nVig-azz burger-- it was big and it was good.  \\nPasta Special-- delish\\n\\nCheesecake-- excellent\\n\\nThe parking was a bit nightmarish but whatever, I am downtown a lot so I am used to it by now.  It's valet ($3) or you have to park across the street on the west side of the Checks Cashed joint. \\n\\nLots of cocktails-- everyone seemed to enjoy them all.  We were a group of 5 and the booth was perfect.  The setting was chill, just a really good experience.  I am looking forward to my next night out at The Vig!\n"

aS'I got two pieces of chicken, mac and cheese, and refried beans with a Coke for under $7.  The chicken was very good tasting, juicy and cooked just right.  The mac and cheese was delicious.  I got this order to go and they had me sit down at a table and the waitress brought the check and my drink over.  It was very nice and relaxing after the morning I had.  They have R and B playing and ESPN on the flat screen tv, so I had no problem waiting for my food to cook.  The restaurant is very clean and everyone was very polite!!  Next time I go back, I want something with BBQ sauce, it smells wonderful!\n'
p1227
aS"MMM! Can you say delicious? You actually won't be saying anything because your mouth will be full of Pad Thai and the Coconut Milk Curry soup! This place was introduced to me by a friend who threw her anniversary party here and it was the best place for service!\\n\\nI absolutely love the Thai Tea and Thai Coffee they serve. It is a definite on the menu of items to try. \\n\\nI absolutely love the decor. Very ornate and very clean!\n"

aS"The house beer here... My friend and I dropped in here for our first times and ordered it. The sweet aroma of that brew was hard to pinpoint. I said some sort of berry, he said orange, and our waitress claimed cannabis. From that point on I was sold.\\n\\nOverall, I like this place. The look and ambience of the Roosevelt with their beer selection and presentation makes for a wholly enjoyable experience. It's definitely worth all the trouble trying to find the place. Depending on how you look at it, the size of this place is either a pro or a con. It's a good thing in that it builds a relaxed and quiet atmosphere, but it might be a negative in the case where the space gets filled easily. The bar is literally a house that they converted which I find cool, but I will admit that some of the rooms give off a claustrophobic feel.\\n\\nThe Roosevelt definitely is and will be a staple of the burgeoning arts district, so try to go by there before it becomes too well known. Make sure to check out the crazy good berry-citric-weed beer too and keep the secret to yourself.\n"
p1229
aS"So far, I can only review the bar for this place, but that's all one needs to be sold on Haus Murphy's. Virtually anything and everything I could think of was stocked in the dense cabinets, and the tap selection was amazing. Amazing, I tell you! Now, I've never had German beer, but my Dunkel Optimiser hit the spot and packed quite a punch. Would drink again, especially since you can get it as a 32. oz. Are you up to that challenge?\\n\\nOf course, the overall atmosphere also rocks. I've walked by here a million times and seen the live polka and such. Consider this a place a glimpse of a culture you won't see too often around these parts. Can't wait to tell you about the food!\n"

aS'"""My boyfriend and I like to come here now just for the dessert.  He\'s not into paying to cook his own food so the allure of the meal packages doesn\'t work on him.  But, dessert we will both do, and the Melting Pot is one of our favorite places to do so.\\n\\nI love the variety that you get with the dessert fondue: cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, cream puffs, strawberries, bananas, multiple types of marshmallows, and pineapples are all cut up into mini pieces perfect for feeding each other behind the closed curtain.  We always choose the turtle (chocolate and caramel with pecan nuts), and request the dark chocolate instead of the milk chocolate for those extra antioxidants.  \\n\\nWe recently came to the one on Ray Rd for our Anniversary on New Year\'s and I was especially pleased with the service.  The waiter not only recommended the correct size we would need for the two of us without trying to upsell us and leave us with way too many leftovers, but he also brought us extra pieces of our favorite \\bites\\"""" when we had finished to make sure we were happy and the extra chocolate didn\'t go to waste. \\n\\nI really appreciated the great service and the great food, and for that I say Thank You Melting Pot!"""""""\n'

aS"Finally, a Southeast Asian food pulse around CenPho. When I first moved here, one of the things I noticed was how few choices there were when it comes to Asian cuisine. So nice to see something a little less common like Cambodian food get represented. \\n\\nThe spring rolls are a must. For $2, you get a very heavily stuffed roll of rice paper touting chicken, shrimp, cilantro, carrots, etc. The beef salad is also a winner. The seafood soup is flavorful and just might literally nourish the soul. The sandwiches with the pork pate are a great lunch choice. One day, I got one plus a roll to go--all under $6. Of the desserts, everyone should try the sweet and salty corn at least once. The tapioca is my favorite. Light and warm. \\n\\nThe best part about eating here is knowing that your money is going toward a very genuine and kind Cambodian family. I have spoken with the chef/owner's son every time I go in. A real sweet guy who will demonstrate how to play the xylophone-esque instrument that is the centerpiece of the main dining room. Speaking of, I love all the touches of decor i.e. travel books on Cambodia at every table. \\n\\nI really, really hope this place does not go the way of some mom-and-pop operations in Phoenix that had really great things to offer. I've been disturbed by the lack of customers I've seen a few times. I want this restaurant to really succeed. I don't want the lines out the door (otherwise I can't get in. ;P) but I want to see a steady stream of patrons. This place really has a chance to be a good-size fish in a big pond. It doesn't fit a cookie-cutter mold and it's got a fantastic bill of fare to show off.\n"

aS'"""To start of the new year, we were in Phoenix. My cousin recommended this place and he was able to make reservations via Open Table for the 6 of us. Our reservations were for 7pm, but they were that packed that we didn\'t get seated until around 7:30. It\'s a cozy lil place and when we finally did get seated we sat in the \\governor\'s corner.\\""""\\n\\nThey had a lot of drink specials which I would have loved to try, but I was feeling under the weather. I ended up ordering the Cedar Planked Salmon. I made my husband get the special for the night,  ribeye surf and turf (basically shrimp, sausage and scallops on a stick as the surf part). My salmon was a slightly over cooked and I wasn\'t a fan of the horseradish potatoes, but I ended up trading the potatoes with my husband\'s potatoes which were so much better. =) He seemed like he enjoyed his meal and he ended up eating the rest of mine too. (That\'s what husband\'s are good for ;)) In any case, I loved the atmosphere and the company. We ended up getting two free desserts with the kitchen being backed up and the wait for the table. We ended up with the croissant bread pudding and the warm chocolate torte. Both were delicious, but the warm chocolate torte was my favorite. \\n\\nOverall, service was good especially for a busy night and food was decent. I would definitely want to come back to try some drink specials and more desserts. =)"""""""\n'

aS"I'm glad that great customer service can still be experienced at a Nordstrom. Sadly, this one is about 800 miles away from where I live.\\n\\nI expected the Scottsdale Nordstrom to be as or more upity than my neighboorhood Cherry Creek spot, but was plensantly surprised. The customer service was great, and when my helper had to transfer to a another customer that arrived before me, he made sure that I was covered by someone else. Nice.\\n\\nWhen I go to Nordstrom, I don't expect great prices, but do expect good quality and great customer service. The Scottsdale employees got it right.\n"

There are so many options on the menu that it is hard to choose from, but I have definitely found 3 favorites on here. The turkey and avocado sandwich was not a fav.. but I'm not much of an avocado fan anyway. I definitely recommend this place to people looking for a good breakfast joint.\n"

aS"So I've been going to this Chino Bandido place off and\\non for a number of years. Great concept - Chinese/Mexican\\n(Con)fusion without any pretense. At the original location\\nby the horsey races they give Chino Bandido virgins the\\nwhole flavor sample deal - you almost get a full meal just\\ntrying all the different possible fillings. So in this\\nChandler location I didn't notice that whole ritual. It\\nis more of just figure out what you want and fill out the order\\nsheet. \\n   The order sheet seems to trip up a lot of folks.\\nIt ain't rocket science or quantum finance, folks. Don't\\neven look at the sheet. Figure out what you want to eat\\nfirst and then look at the sheet (see photo) and figure out \\nhow to express that. \\n  It's easy. You get 14 items to choose from: Carnitas, Chile\\nRelleno, Chinese BBQ Pork, Egg Foo Yung, Gringo Chicken, Hengrenade\\nChicken, Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, Jerk Chicken, Emerald\\nChicken, Teriyaki Chicken, Veggie Salad, Pollo Diablo, and Machaca.\\nGot all that? Now you can choose to get this as a rice bowl, \\ncombination, Quesadilla, or Burrito. \\n   For the rice bowl, you just choose one item with steamed rice or\\noptional beans as well. You can also add fried rice for 75 cents.\\n   For the combo, you can choose two different items (it says 1-20 \\nbut I think they meant 14) and circle either BLK for Black or REF for \\nrefried beans. Then you also choose what type of fried rice you want. \\nJFR for Jerk Fried Rice, CFR for Chicken Fried Rice, PKFR for pork \\nfried rice, and PLFR for plain fried rice. This is pretty much the \\nfull-on big plate. You can also get the items in either a burrito or \\na quesadilla by specifying a Q or B. This way you get a burrito or\\nquesadilla in addition to your fried rice and beans. \\n   You can also get items as Quesadillas. You can mix more than one\\nitem together if you're daring. Same with the burritos. \\n   You can also order the rice and beans as a separate side if you \\ndidn't get the rice bowl or combo and wanted it anyway. You can get\\nit as a pint or quart as well if you want to take some home.\\n   Finally, the cookies. You get a free cookie anyway but if one ain't\\nenough they have a space for you to order half a dozen or a dozen.\\n   Drinks - pretty much self explanatory. I like this place. I don't need\\nan endorsement by Guy Fieri to justify my liking this place. This is \\nan occasional lunch outing with co-workers when the mood strikes. Lately\\nI've just been getting Quesadillas and Burritos and skipping the whole\\nrice and beans thing. I don't need to fall asleep in any meetings thank\\nyou. :) One thing about this location - even though you don't need \\nhigher education to fill out the order form you might still need a \\nsextant, compass, telescope, and charts to find the place. The Google\\nmap makes it look like it is right on Chandler but it's deep southeast \\ninto the mall. Lots of parking but not necessarily right next to the\\nplace during the lunch rush.\n"

aS"I really love this place!! Nothinglike a fun Sunday meal with my family to make me love it even more. We stuffed ourselves with delish catfish, fried shrimp , and tasty hazelnut Mahi. Service from Rocky was \\nreally fast , effiecient without that fake cloying attitude. Felt like we were\\nthe center of the restaurant. Funny how things like fast drink refills, quick service and welltime plate removal can do that.  \\nAnd here is the kicker of the evening ..I know have ordered or tasted every dessert on thier dessert tray, scary but true. Did you know that three of their desserts are made fresh there the rest including cheesecakes are made in Texas and brought in. I got the fresh Brulee  . yummy.   Can't wait to go back.\n"

aS"We went late on a weeknight after having a pretty bad day, so I would like to go back another time to fully enjoy the experience. While sushi certainly didn't fix anything, it did make the day a little better to digest. We weren't overly hungry, so we didn't order too much... but their alcoholic drinks were very delicious! They have some neat mixed drinks to try out, so I want to go back and try some more of them out too! I forget what I had, but it was very tasty and very strong, although I didn't notice how strong it was while I was drinking it! :) The sushi itself was also good, and the miso soup was tasty. It wasn't very busy, but then again it was late on a weeknight. Not sure how busy it gets, but it was a nice relaxed atmosphere when we went. Everyone was very nice, and I feel bad because I was not in the best of moods. They were still super nice to me, though! We will be going back ASAP, for sure... and we will bring friends and family, too!\n"

They sold me pure fat for 0.99cents a lb (best to call ahead, though I caught them in the middle of a butchering and they happen to have a slab handy to chop for me immediately), which is wonderful for adding into your own homemade sausages.  I used to purchase the fat pre-pckgd at Lee Lee's but could no longer find it in the past year, so I am glad to have discovered this place!\n"

aS"It's been over two years since my first review of SMC, I've since bought a new mountain bike from them and have had routine service there - and my review stays at a 5 star without question.\\n\\nI spent a lot of money there because they take the time to deal with my indecisiveness in dropping $3k. I had other options and I was shopping around including online but my decision came down to them. They're local, they ride the trails I ride, they're extremely experienced and knowledgable and seem to give a shit with my hundreds of questions I had in 26 vs 29, brain vs no brain, chassis geometry, this rear set with that shifter etc... like endless knowledge of everything they stock and more.\\n\\nIt came down to ordering a brand new 2011 or taking the last 2010 upper model in the shop. After some talking I walked out with the more upgraded 2010 model. I got a great price, had it in-hands and didn't have to wait the 4+ months to get the new one and I was stoked.\\n\\nRecently I brought her in for routine maintenance, left it there after my ride on a sunday and was back in hands tuesday afternoon. It went in dirty and grimy - came out like a million bucks :) Like seriously as clean as the day I bought it... \\n\\nAnyways - they care, they have only the best bikes there and evidently the best help, and that is why I spend my money there and recommend them to you.\\n\\nRide hard kids...\n"

aS"First it was kosher. Then it was kosher-style. Now it's kosher again (and has been for several years.) The recipes never changed - the politics of this silly town did.\\n\\nAnd all along, it's been my favorite little Jewish bakery in town. Chompies is nothing in comparison!\\n\\nThe Raspberry Delight cake has been my favorite cake EVER, consistently, for about 20 years. I've even given it as a birthday cake and anniversary cake to loved ones. Don't let the small size fool you - this thing packs a wallop of flavor!\\n\\nThe breads are always consistently really good. This morning, the Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated and I were in, and he opted for a marble rye. A gorgeous, perfect, deceptively heavy super crusty rye. YUM!\\n\\nI avoid the butter cookies as much as I can. Mostly because once I eat one, I won't stop until they're all gone. Yes, I have eaten almost a full pound in one day. Not a pretty sight.\\n\\nAll the other cookies, cakes, mondelbread, hamentaschen, etc. are top notch, too.\\n\\nSo nice to have a real old school kosher bakery in the hood!\n"

aS'Great store, plenty of parking, and has everything from biking, clothing, kayaking and rock climbing.  I can spend hours looking through the different sections of the store and walking out with new gadgets and boots.  \\n\\nWhat ever it is that you do in the outdoors, they most likely will have it.  There employees really know what they are talking about, having much experience in the outdoors and the products that they sell.  They got a bike shop inside so they can fix your bike or what ever.  They have classes on GPS, bike care, kayaking and tons of other things during the week and on the weekend.  They have the most recent products there and  much more... they have everything you need for that next trip, hike or ride.\n'

aS"This is the best buffet in Az. HUGE variety from veggie dishes, fish, shrimp, mussels, and even sushi. The quality of food is very good too. One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food, look inside! This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good. Just sayin'. For a buffett, they have a really nice staff. There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing. It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks. I eat here at least once every couple weeks.\n"

aS"The first couple of times I went to Nee House I was unimpressed.  We had ordered typical stuff off their American menu, which was okay but nothing to rave about. Then I dined there with a Chinese friend who ordered off their Chinese menu, and my opinion of Nee House did a 180 degree turn.  If you're ready to be a little adventurous, you're in for a taste treat!  I love their steamed fish, which is slathered in a delicate, flavorful broth.  The Kowloon Crab is a garlicky treat, but wear old clothes when you dig into this sticky hands-on goodie or your next stop might have to be the dry cleaners.  Other favorites are the Szechuan Green Beans and Garlic Eggplant.\n"
p1244
aS"Good sushi + a good price = winner. It's hard to find a decent place for sushi that doesn't cost an arm and a leg...except at dozo. Here you get the best of both. I really like the amount of specialty rolls they have here and the favor combos. The prices for the rolls are great too with the specialty rolls topping out at like $11-12 for 8 rather large pieces and they don't skimp on the fish in them. A good judge is that a  negihama roll had not chopped yellowtail but slices of fish and plenty of scallion for i think $5.\\n\\nThe only things keeping this place from a 5 star are that it can take awhile to get the food (even when you are the only people there) and some of the rolls aren't wrapped well so it's hard to pick them up with chopsticks. But These are really outweighed by the quality of the fish and the prices.\n"

aS"This is Tempe's greatest kept lunch spot secret.  \\n\\nThe food is always super fresh and delicious.  The service is awesome and its family owned.  They also use a lot of local fresh food.  For example, they get their hoagies fresh daily from an Italian deli nearby.  And it's some of the best bread I've ever had.\\n\\nI've tried everything on the menu and I've been a regular for several years.  If I had to recommend one thing on the menu it'd be the Italian Cheesesteak (add mayo, lettuce, tomato to make it 'hoagie style').  They grill that bad boy up fresh every time.  The soups are great too, my favorite is a tie between the Albondigas and Broccoli Cheese.  My wife enjoys the tuna or turkey.  You can't go wrong, check it out!\n"
p1246
aS"First, I did not eat here.  This has nothing to do with the food.\\n\\nI was in the area and had heard about this place.  Younger crowd (yes, it's close to ASU) but good music, good atmosphere.\\n\\nStrong pours from the staff.  I mean strong.  I mean five stars strong, on any type of liquor, any bottle.  If you hang out in Scottsdale and need a reprieve from that scene (and that L.A./Vegas price point for drinks), this is a place that should be on your short list.  You will think you died and went to heaven when you get the tab!\n"

aS'"""I really enjoyed this place.  Made a reservation for 4 and mentioned my wife\'s birthday.  We were seated promptly and the service from start to finish was very attentive.  We started with the appetizer plate and split a couple of salads.  The appetizer plate consisted of sushi, a shrimp stick, a lobster potsticker, and something else that escapes me.  Very good and the platter for two was split by the four of us.  We had the farm salad whick contained walnuts, different veggies and an outstanding dressing.  Our friends had what was titled I believe \\Wowie Shrimp\\"""" and they really enjoyed it.  For main courses, I had Mahi Mahi crusted with Macadamai nuts--delicious with a lobster glaze type sauce.  Rich but very good.  My wife and one of our friends had Scallops with basil---excellent dish and huge portion--scallops had a little crust on the outside and very tender on the inside.  Our other friend had Ono (sp.?) and really enjoyed it as well.  We ordered to of their lava cakes for dessert.  They brought out one decorated for my wife\'s birthday and didn\'t make the traditional scene that many restaurants do.  They comp\'d both desserts which I thought was pretty classy.  All in all a very good experience and certainly worth another visit."""""""\n'

aS'"""We went to the Farm to check out the Farmer\'s Market and go to lunch.  It was amazing.  I can\'t believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house.  It\'s almost hard to believe it\'s even in Phoenix - though to a native like me, it\'s just one more reason to remember why Phoenix is so great.  \\n\\nWhen most folks used to think of South Phoenix they thought of crime, blight and anything else associated with being on the \\wrong\\"""" side of the tracks.  Sure, there may have been areas right next to downtown that were like that, but most of South Phoenix was all farming community.  While some of this still exists - especially near and in Laveen - most of these farm plots were sold off during the years to individuals for their own homes - and any of the large lots were sold off to developers in the last 10-15 years or so.  Most of these became mass produced houses (like mine) or shopping centers.  The Farm is off of 32nd street (with property stretching back almost to 24th street) between Baseline and Southern.   To put this in perspective - there is a huge Target/Fry\'s/Ross/Applebee\'s kind of complex at 24th and Baseline - and the South Mountain Community College is just North of that on 24th.  At 32nd and Baseline there is the Raven Golf course, with lots of condos all around it.  That all seems a whole world away once you pull in to The Farm.\\n\\nI\'m attaching some pictures from their web site www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com.  I\'ve been only to one of the restaurants so far - The Farm Kitchen which is their lunch spot.  But I plan to visit Morning Glory soon.  All the stores are amazing - and it\'s so cool to see where it all grows.  As we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids (and adults) having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants, in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley, or sold at their Farmers market to be eaten in their own home.\\n\\nCheck out their menus online.  Yes - it\'s a bit pricey.  I was hesitant that I\'d think it was \\""""worth it\\"""".  But oh it was.  I can\'t explain it any better than stealing from a commercial - You can TASTE the freshness!  Everything just tasted so much better.  Not that the atmosphere didn\'t help - but it wasn\'t the only factor.  One interesting thing to mention - pets are ok.  There were two folks there who brought their dogs.  The doggies seemed quite happy to have some run around space (leashed of course) and then a nice meal by a picnic bench.  \\n\\nI\'m planning to go again - bringing lots of friends and family at different times.  I\'d love to try out their yoga and/or gardening classes too! This will definitely be on the short list of places a visitor needs to go when visiting from out of town.  Better yet though - it\'s one of the few places you can go in town and feel like you took a day trip out of the valley."""""""\n'

Smells the way I want an Italian restaurant to small - warm, slightly tomatoey, garlicky - welcoming :0)\\n\\nWe were quickly seated though the place was crowded. Warm breads and spicy dipping peppers brought to table with drinks.....mmmmmmm.\\n\\nService was friendly and knowledgeable - owner Joe stopped by to check in\\n- was visible in the dining room throughout our visit - nice wine list - my medium red was smooth and fruity - entrees plentiful and prepared as you order them....this is not The Olive Garden!

aS"How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint that's less authentic - hit up Z'Tejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and it's hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!\n"

aS'"""Eat Mor Chikin. That\'s all I can say. Chik-fil-A and baseball apparently go together like pitching and Tommy John surgeries. To avoid paying a premium for buying food at the ballpark, we stopped at a nearby Chik-fil-A for a quick bite. I spent $6.29 on a chicken breast sandwich, fries and a drink, and what did I find inside my paper bag? A coupon for $5 off baseball tickets. Talk about a win-win! \\n\\nPeoria Sports Complex is another great ballpark in Arizona! We came here last Monday for a Giants/Padres night game, and I was really impressed with the facilities. With the aforementioned coupon, we were able to purchase $21 club level seats for $16 apiece. \\n\\nNow, mind you, these are premium, wide, padded seats between home plate and first base for $16. Plus, you get an exclusive concession area and an elevator, should you need one. Most people in the section were older, armed with a scorecard and a #2 pencil. Our friend even caught a ball when he went to get a beer (and by \\caught\\"""" I mean \\""""found it on the ground\\"""" because he was the only one getting a beer at that time). \\n\\nThe ballpark\'s batter\'s eye reminded me of PETCO Park, which, I am sure, is not coincidental. Peoria Sports Complex has the best scoreboard in all of Cactus League, too. I am sure while reading this, some Padres AND Giants fans might channel Skip from Bull Durham and say: \\""""What do we need a scoreboard for? We haven\'t scored any runs all season!\\"""" I am sure that\'s about to change. \\n\\nParking here at Peoria Sports Complex is another matter. For $5, you get to park close to the stadium, but if you are too lazy to walk, just take the shuttle. The shuttle is a guy in a golf cart that seats seven. Man, I would pay $5 just for the ride. It\'s fun, kind of like a roller coaster ride for shut-ins. Highly recommended. \\n\\nNote: Nearby Hooters is open late after the game. So if you started your night with a chicken breast sandwich like I did, you can end your night with . . . Well, I\'ll let YOU finish that sentence."""""""\n'

aS"This place was packed on a Tuesday night. Granted it was during Spring Training, but I don't think they have a problem filling the joint. It's got a great atmosphere. The bar seemed fun with live music playing and lots of people enjoying themselves. \\n\\nThe food... If you love enormous portion sizes, then this is your place. I had the petite fillet and couldn't finish it, which I was very sad about because it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. My husband had the bone in fillet, which was terrific as well. For sides we just ordered one because we knew we wouldn't be able to finish more than that. We had the crab gnocchi, which was great, but a little too rich for me -- not the restaurant's fault - bad ordering on our part. We didn't have room for dessert. Oh, one of the reasons we didn't have room for dessert is because we ate too much of the amazing bread basket they bring you. Pretzel bread, olive bread, amazing sourdough rolls - all worth trying. \\nThe service was OK. Definitely some room for improvement. Overall though, the experience was good and you can't dock them for the service because the food shines. \\nThis place would be great on an expense account.\n"

aS"What a wonderful place!  There was nothing on the menu that I wouldn't get along with.  It took me a while to decide because everything sounded fantastic.\\n\\nI started with one of their fresh squeezed/blended juices (ginger, agave and soda).  It was light, refreshing and REALLY good.  Highly recommend this one.\\n\\nI finally decided on the tuna sliders which comes with a side of kale salad or roasted sweet potatoes per the menu.  Our server told us that we could get it with 'half and half' sides.  So, of course, I went half kale salad and half sweet potatoes.\\n\\nThe sliders were good but the size of the tuna in each was not real consistent - the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars.  Another person in our group also ordered the sliders.  For my two, one of my sliders had a really thin piece of tuna and the other one had about a 1/2 thick chunk.  The other order had different size pieces too - strange.\\n\\nI usually don't order dessert but was really tempted by the 'stellar' Banana Chocolate Caramel Tart as described by our server.  'Stellar' was the perfect description for this masterpiece.  The chocolate crust contained mesquite flour which I found really unusual as I had never had it before.  We visited the Desert Botanical Garden and learned about the mesquite tree/shrub and the guide told us how they make flour from it.\\n\\nService was absolutely top notch FANTASTIC!  Our server was super helpful and knew that menu backwards and forwards and knew all the ingredients/spices in everything. \\n\\nI wish we had this kind of a place in central Illinois!\n"

aS"There's this Chinese math teacher at the school I work at (I know, how cliche right?) and he's been telling me all year that I HAVE to go here, and that it's the most authentic Chinese food around town.  So finally, I did.  I have no idea about authenticity, but I do know it was delicious and cheap.  It was pretty crowded on the day we came in, but we found our own seat and waited a few minutes before menus were brought to us.  There are about a billion choices, all of them priced well under 10 bucks.  This place simply cannot be beat for value.  \\n\\nAbsolutely clueless about what to order, I stuck with what I knew, and got the Orange Chicken Bowl, an egg roll and a can of soda that only cost 92 cents.  Our food didn't take too long, and my egg roll came out first.  It was so tasty!  It was packed full of good stuff and the sauce to dip it in was quite good.  My Orange Chicken Bowl came out in the shape of a plate.  I thought that was odd, but who really cares.  The orange chicken was really good.  It had a bright flavor and the sauce was just thick enough to cover the chicken properly.  The fried rice was the best fried rice I have ever had.  I still think about it actually.\\n\\nI would definitely love to come back to this place, especially since it is right by the Light Rail.  Hopefully I will be better prepared to order something a little more adventurous next time.\n"

aS"This place is the Hope Diamond of hidden gems! I grew up in an Italian household, so Italian food is as personal as it gets for me. And this place does Italian well enough to please my grandmother. My husband and I went for a romantic dinner, and we were not disappointed at the amibance of the place. The owner himself was seating everyone and while it was an air of elegance, we also felt really welcomed. Our waiter Julio brought us our menus and ice water right away, which was great because it was super hot out, even for Arizona. We selected a Chardonnay from Fess Parker vineyards, and because we had a gift certificate from restaurants.com, we opted to split a bottle of it. It was the first of many great decisions. For our appetizer we split the antipasto for 2. Incredible. Fresh veggies that were perfectly roasted, cold, salty meats, sweet rich cheeses, awesome! Their fresh sourdough bread was a pleasure to eat, with that just right crispy crust and light, fluffy middle. We both had the ceasar salad, which really prepped us well for our meal, as it was well sized and not overly dressed.  I ended up with the seafood risotto and my husband had the baked ziti with sausage. We were stunned. First of all, they came out HOT! Not the luke warm-ness that's becoming too common now, but truly hot! My husband loved his ziti. He went so far as to say it's better the first baked ziti he ever had, which was on New York's Mulberry Street with his parents when he was a teen. My risotto had so many layers of deep intense flavor I was beside myself. Not overly full of seafood, but enough to satisfy the craving, the clams, mussles, scallops and shrimp were to perfection. There was small peices of shredded lobster throughout. The peas, red peppers and asparagus were done well, but not mushy and the rice was just al dente. The saffron lobster bisque broth was intense in flavor but let each aspect of the dish shine through! As much as we were enjoying dinner, we decided to take half of each portion (very large portions, so bring friends or a large appetite or be prepared to take some home) home with us so we could have dessert. I'm so glad we did. We had the vanilla creme brulee. You could actually see the vanilla beans in the custard. And it wasn't overly sweet. Too many are cloyingly so, but not this one! And it had a rather thick ring of the burnt sugar, which I liked, cause to me that's the best thing about creme brulee. The owner, as mentioned by others, was all over the place, but always making time to sit and chat with his patrons to make sure they were happy. Julio was fabulously attentive, not being in our faces, but our glasses were never empty and the pace was perfect. We agreed this is a place we'll be going to at least once a month, if not more!\n"

aS'"""I\'ve been going to Oregano\'s for years. It has always been fantastic. The wait can get ridiculous at times so I plan accordingly. But the last time I went it was less than stellar. To avoid the wait for a table (it was rainy and cold this day otherwise we would have taken the faster option of getting seated with first available) we chose to sit at the bar and eat. The waiter took the order of the couple sitting next to us and then took ours immediately after. Our neighbors received their order in the expected amount of time, however, our order did not come out until our neighbors had eaten and paid. This was a bit annoying since we were quite hungry and the orders were taken at the same time. They ordered a large pizza and salads. We ordered a small pizza and a order of wings (their wings are terrific fyi). So I didn\'t see what the hold up was. When we finally received our order I was not at all satisfied with the pizza. It didn\'t have the same crispy, delicious crust I was used to, but I am not the type to complain about the food unless there is something seriously wrong. So I just dealt with it. I went to the lady\'s room to sufficiently clean up the wing sauce and when I got back I overheard the waiter/bartender and my boyfriend talking. He asked how everything was and my boyfriend said the pizza was ok but the wings were great. The waiter left and we were visited by whom I think is the manager. She was an older lady and looked in charge anyway. She came, made some small talk and laughed with us for a moment, and then asked us about our experience. She heard our pizza was only \\ok\\"""" and wanted to know what it was that only made it \\""""ok.\\"""" So I explained to her and she took what I said seriously. She also took the price of the pizza off the check which was not necessary at all. Although it had been a less than stellar visit to Oregano\'s I knew that I would be back again because all the other times I\'ve been there have been wonderful. I was completely delighted with this experience because they really showed that they care about what their customers think and they care about their experience with them. I recommend checking it out! Also, do not pass up the pizzookie (pizza cookie), it is to DIE for! yummmmm!"""""""\n'

aS"Being from the North Carolina coast and now living in Glendale, Arizona I find that the food I miss the most is seafood. Clearly living in Arizona limits my ability to find good, fresh seafood-let alone trying to find well prepared seafood. Tonight I found fresh seafood that was prepared just the way I like it-fried with extra sides of tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, coleslaw (mayo not red), and a healthy selection of domestic beer. \\n\\nTy, the server at the counter, was helpful and very interested in making sure the dining experience was met with great service. While the atmosphere left you feeling like you may end up with a pirate cap (e.g. Long John Silver), the beach music on the radio made me feel like I was home. \\n\\nThis wonderful little find came to me by pure accident as my wife was giving me directions to Next Place Coffee (see my next review) and mistakenly gave me 59th and Union Hills as cross-streets.

Not since going to the houses of friends of my father many years ago have I tasted food like this. \\n\\nI should clarify...\\n\\nThere are great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, but a lot of the places have food that tastes like restaurant/deli food. This is not bad at all...restaurant food can be very delicious. But, then there are places that serve food the way \\Mom\\"""" makes it. It\'s that special little bit of love that I\'m talking about.

The hummus and baba were solid, loaded with garlic and topped generously with olive oil. The gyro plate was also solid, the meat wasn\'t too dry and the veggies were definitely fresh. Above the previous two menu items stood the beef kebab sultani. Each bite had the two of us smiling because it was so good. The kebab meat had flavor infused into the core of each piece...never did I chew a bite and not get the flavor of the marinade. It was awesome. We also got to taste some of their hot dolma. I have only been served hot dolma at three restaurants, and each time they have been great; definitely worth trying if you\'re a dolma fan.\\n\\nThere is one last thing that we tried that everyone needs to come to Eden\'s Grill for though, and that is the rice - basmati w/ golden raisins and chopped almonds.

Don't get me wrong, I love a dive bar every once-in-awhile, especially when it's super close to my house, but Coach House will never be a regular in my rotation... and will always require a good ten minute shower and shampoo / conditioning rinse of my hair.

I just woke up, I\'m not looking like the hottest/hippest/nicest person in Tempe. I mean, I never look like that but when I NEED coffee, I need to dose myself in a safe and secure environment.\\n\\nSo I went to Cartel expecting the worst, I ordered Iced Toddy. To keep my order neutral and cheap. It was okay. Pretty f-ing good in comparison to xtreme bean, my only other Toddy experience. I branched out into soy Lattes because I like to get some protein in the morning. I know....latte for breakfast - aren\'t I a pillar of health?\\n\\nNO ONE judged me when I would order my soy latte with sugar-free vanilla in it. NO ONE. I\'ve gotten some jokes about it, but who gives a fuck? It\'s $4.50 - I\'m being a yuppie suburban bore when I order it and I know it and I don\'t give a shit if they know it. I love them for keeping me in check anyways. How is a kid from Tempe supposed to know anything about coffee? That\'s not my business. As the customer, it\'s our business to try new things as suggested by the people who\'s life\'s work is coffee.\\n\\nSo I tried an americano by suggestion. Its DELICIOUS. GET ONE. Iced/Hot, whatthefuckeverjustgetone. I go here for an americano EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE except when I am out of town and I bemoan the lack of Cartel even when I\'m in Los Angeles (Mighty City of Intelligentsia). Which brings me to another point, the LINES.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a McLatte, they exist. It\'s called McDonalds. They are everywhere. Cartel is not a run in/run out kind of place. They are offering a luxury item as well as an experience. You wouldn\'t go to a spa and bitch about your facial taking too long. If you want to see lines, go to Intelligentsia during the midday rush and you will immediately appreciate what Cartel is doing.\\n\\nFor serving the entire ASU community with outstanding coffee, 20 minutes sounds about right. For a drink that is delicately crafted from bean to cup, $2.50-$4.50 is just right. For a locally owned company successfully competing with corporate giants, you might as well just go and give a deserving shop your money. \\n\\nAnd if you are nervous about being judged by the \\hip\\"""" kids who look like they smelled a fart, recognize that they are only posing with their macbooks and modern literature and are too vain to break character. \\nAnd if you are nervous about being judged by the baristas, try SMILING at the people who are SERVING you - because you remember how hard it was to deal with customers before you got your middle management salaried job, right?\\n\\nI love you, Cartel."""""""\n'

I really wish more people would pull over while going thru the Camelback Corridor. Besides really good coffee, the man knows how to make good breakfast burritos and sandwiches. Cesar is a hardworking, kind and dependable proprietor. I really hope more people stop by and give this place a chance. It's actually opened late too!\n"

aS'I loved the Pink Spot.  I have been there a few times already.  The first time I had to try the Kona Coffee ice cream.  It was delicious and so I got it in a shake and walked around Roosevelt during First Friday cooling off with my delicious shake.  I, being the coffee addict that I am, went back for another shake a few days later.  Oh my, it is delightful.  A couple of weeks later my husband and I were lunching at Z Pizza and walked through the doorway connecting the two and got the Kona Mint Sundae.  It is a scoop of Kona (my favorite) and Mint Chocolate Chip (his favorite) with hot fudge  and  whipped cream.  It was perfect for sharing and was a tasty end to our meal.  \\n\\nAlso, they have a really neat lamp hanging up at the end of the counter by the register that looks like white mesh tubes tangled together.  I was really interested in it so I asked the girl behind the counter where it came from.  The owner was sitting at one of the tables so we talked about it.  He even told me where he bought it in (a store up near Kierland Commons) and we had a nice little conversation about the design.  \\n\\nPink Spot has a couple of new fans....\n'

He got my mountain bike tuned up and ready to go in an hour after I called to set an appointment the day before. At first, I called a few highly rated bike shops close to me to schedule a tune up.  I called on a Thursday afternoon. Even though I was told: \\Sure, just bring it in\\"""" ..no one could get it done before end of day Monday. That translates into a full weekend without my bike. No way! Chris saved the day and had me up and running for my Moab trip in no time.  Thanks so much Chris!"""""""\n'

aS"Wow, this place has been open for just a month and I am the sixth review.  At first I was disappointed with the service, it was a little slow, but it turns out that we got there right before the next shift started.  Our server was very knowledgeable about wines and helped me make a great choice -- I concur with Natalie the pour was generous.  As we were getting ready to leave Bruno, chef and owner came by to talk to us.  He was very friendly (like his staff) and I can't wait for the next visit when I am in the area again.\n"

aS'I am a fan of big and tasty sandwiches but have had very few really good ones as of late. That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.\\n\\nThe 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar  and  American\\n\\nWhat makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again\\n\\nFor me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL.\n'

aS"After a long day of nursing a hangover and a long night of pretending to not be home because we didn't have any Halloween candy for trick or treaters, we decided we needed some pizza. I drive by Florencia everyday and we keep saying we need to check out some of the establishments in this shopping center. Yelp says it's good, so obviously, I trust the palettes of my fellow Yelpers. We headed up there, it was pretty dead and the owner met us at the door and said we could only get takeout because they were closing up at little early. It was only about a half hour early and the guy was real cool about it, so we were fine with it. We went up to the bar and ordered a 12 inch pepperoni and italian sausage. All the girls at the bar seemed really sweet. They told us about 15 mins, so we sat down to wait, one of the girls came around to offer us something to drink while we waited, which I thought was nice. I can see some of the comments about the decor. At first I thought it was odd that the floor is just concrete, but it actually all kind of grew on me after sitting there for a bit. It has kind of a rustic tavern-ish feel. We started talking to Val, the owner, who was a real nice guy. Telling us about the place, they've been there for 11 years I think he said, so it's a nice neighborhood joint. He was real down to earth, just sitting at the bar drinking a beer and catching the end of the game. We noted that they had a pretty interesting beer selection both on draft and in bottles, which he said he rotates fairly frequently. He seems to have a pretty strong passion for beer and real interested in getting in some local brews and interesting selections in there. We got our pizza home and it was cheesy and delicious. The crust wasn't super flavorful, but the texture was perfectly crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The sauce had good flavor and the ingredients tasted like high quality. The pepperoni had a real nice rich flavor and the sausage had a nice flavor with the fennel and other herbs and spices. True it was a little on the expensive side but I'd rather give my money to a nice guy like Val than to Domino's any day. I'm looking forward to heading up there again to sit at the bar, watch a game and enjoy some more pizza or perhaps one of his calzones with a local brew!\n"

Try the Pho- you won't regret it.  Spring Rolls are fantastic- I love the variety and splitting several w/my husband. Ambiance is awesome- not your run of the mill chain restaurant drab beige interior, as they've made over an eyesore of a historic home into a chic and welcoming spot you'd be proud to take a date... and you must take anyone who thinks the Phoenix food scene is lacking in character and hipness ;)\n"

aS"My almost 3-year-old son loved this place!  It's a nice respite during the miserable summer weather.  It's perfect for kids his age.  There was something for all interests--visual, art, tactile, everything!  I love that all the rooms are kid-sized, including the sinks in the bathroom and a separate/lower hand-rail on the stairs\\n\\nProbably not the best value for crawlers or older kids.  But for 2-5 yr-olds, it's a wonderful place!  The only annoying part are the parents who don't lead their kids by example.  Saw some pretty poorly-behaved, rude, and bully kids there.  But that has nothing to do with the museum.  Just a sad commentary of the lack-of parenting skills out there.\\n\\nAnyway, we love the museum and think that it's the best $9/person we've spent all summer!\n"

aS"This place pleasantly surprised me. For years I've looked over at this sandwich joint as I walked into one of my all-time favorite lunch time spots Essence Bakery. I ordered today's sandwich special which was a Cajun Grilled Chicken sandwich on a fresh baguette. The flavor of this sandwich literally blew me away! The combination of the spicy grilled chicken, lettuce, melted cheese, saut\\u00e9ed green and red peppers with onion was YUMMMY!!! The portion was a little big for me but I managed to scarf down the excess! It was definitely worth the $6.95. I loved the little mini cookie that all the sandwiches come with, it was more or less a sample because I definitely wanted to buy the larger cookie after that tease. My sister had the Sacks Overture which is basically a spruced up Roast Beef sandwich, she said the beef was good but the Horseradish sauce snuck up on her (too bad she doesn't have spice tolerant palate). The place has indoor and outdoor seating. Inside is a little too dim for me, but hey I didn't come there for great ambiance I came for a great sandwich and my mission was accomplished. See ya soon Sacks!\n"

We ordered the pineapple cream cheese wontons for an appetizer and they were good, but nothing to rave about, so I'm glad we got them for free with a coupon. My husband ordered Sake, but the waitress forgot about it (as did we) until the end of the meal, so she gave it to us on the house.

aS"I have been here only once and it was for my best friends birthday.  I made a reservation but it was unfortunately late in the evening because I made it late.  I expected there to be more people since I was told that the only time they had available was 915pm.  I was ok with this but only because it was for my besty.  We arrived and were quickly seated.  Since it was her first time they went over the whole shpeal about how it works.  We started out with the Wisconsin Trio Cheese Fondue.  I had never thought of bleu cheese in a fondue but boy was this rich and creamy.  We thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  The only dipping item that I didn't enjoy with it was the uncooked broccoli.  We then moved to the Cesar Salad.  The parmesan encrusted pine nuts were so good we spent quite a bit of time talking about it.  We then got the Land  and  Sea and a side of the teriyaki-marinated sirloin.  The fun of cooking the food soon became apparent.  She had thought that this would be tedious but quickly warmed to it and enjoyed finding the perfect cook time for the shrimp so that the tail slid right off.  She enjoyed finding different dipping sauces for each of her meats and for the veggies.  The night quickly moved to dessert.  When we were kids we would stay up late and watch horror movies and melt chocolate and peanut butter so The Original was a perfect match for us.  By this time we were fairly full and had forgotten to save room for dessert.  But we ate it anyway.  I love the dippers that are provided.  The strawberries are always fresh and sweet, the bananas were good (based on my friends review, again with the stupid allergies),  The cheesecake was rich and creamy, Rice crispy treats are always good and then add peanut butter and chocolate and heaven is tasted, the graham cracker encrusted and oreo encrusted marshmellows are wonderful and I wish I knew how to make them, the poundcake was divine and the brownies were rich.  Needless to say the dessert was a hit.  The price is high but worth it.  Had to take a star away for the late reservation even though they weren't very busy.  The waitress was ok but the experience at the Scottsdale location with the flambe was an added enjoyment.  It is a nice location.\n"

I lost my cell phone while I was there.  It was an extremely busy Saturday afternoon at a car wash, as you can imagine it would be.

He also gave us a brief history about the place and how it was came new management recently, but kept the menu the same (except for the omission of ham last week).\\n\\nThe food was delicious and the amount was well worth the price (about $10/person for breakfast).  The red pepper hash was tasty, with a very slight crunch on the bottom and a mouth-watering flavour profile.

aS"This bar has been part of the valley gay scene for so long... from what i've heard it's been around here for more than twenty years, another landmark but what impresses most is not solely its longevity in Phoenix but that its been in Old Town Scottsdale all this time away from what people call gay Phoenix in downtown. \\n\\nMy first introduction to BS West was a long time ago... well long to me... back in 2005. I had been to Charlie's, and at one time there was Crowbar which is now Club Downtown. Also had been to Boom! But never heard of BS West until someone mentioned on facebook group of a gay club hidden behind Acme in Old Town. They described it as the gay club down the alley that it was hidden that anyone could easily miss it. So I went with two friends and based on pure curiousty, walked down the alley next to Acme and saw a door (pre-patio days) with a sign above it that said BS West. It was a Sat. and it wasn't too crowded but we were in awe... it was true there was an actual gay bar near Tempe. And that's how I was introduced to the 2-4-1 drink specials and the BS West chips. \\n\\nThis video bar of which I think is its only kind in Phoenix and really haven't found any other video bars in other gay havens is such a nifty idea. I mean, haven't you ever been in a club and just didn't want to dance but the song is so good, that you gotta do something? well the video bar concept is awesome in that you can drink and watch the music video and kinda dance along... LOVE IT! You can never beat the drink specials here on Wed. which has always been 2-4-1 and Sat nights too. Both nights are crazy packed... that I'm sure it's against fire code but there's no restrictions... just a mass of gay men, and all kinds too, intermingle some queer peers too and it's just a great environment! Strong drinks too. But what I love apart from the drink specials are the poker chips which you can use as currency in the future. Certain colors mean certain drinks like cocktails, shots and the like. The Dj usually plays a good mix but depends who's there and if there having an off night but if you want a good time, strong drinks, and just a packed atmosphere... check out BS West or BS!\n"

Forgettable.\\n\\nThe lobster and corn bisque was tasty and deserves a \\""""Bravo!\\""""  Met my expectations, maybe exceeded it a little bit. \\n\\nThe Kobe Flat Iron, however, fell flat (pun intended.)  I have prepared a Kobe NY strip (which I purchased at A.J.\'s Fine Foods for $39/lb.) at home on my grill that tasted better than the dish I got from Bourbon Steak.   \\n\\nOne would expect a Kobe steak to \\""""wow!\\"""" you when you take that first bite and also that last bite, and in this case, it just did not happen.  The steak was not particularly flavorful, and was not particularly tender.  The onions overpowered the dish a bit, leaving me with a strong and unpleasant \\""""onion\\"""" taste in my mouth for the rest of the night.\\n\\nMy advice on Kobe steak:  if you want an affordable Kobe experience, hit A.J.\'s and grill it yourself at home.\\n\\nThe Berry Parfait was totally tasty.  Great ending for the meal - super-fresh fruit chunks, everything worked together very well.  I\'d pay $8 for that on a menu.\\n\\nThe place was very loud.  It was only about half full, but the sound reverberates in that place.  Tables are close together so you get to hear your neighbor\'s conversations, barely, above the overall din.\\n\\nThe SERVICE WAS SPECTACULAR.  Within 5 minutes of sitting down, I had my order placed, water to drink, and duck fat fries on the table.  They never let me sit there waiting around for water, or to remove a completed dish - they were ALL over it like a good team.  I\'d bet 6 or 7 different people served my table.  Service definitely was the best part of the experience.\\n\\nSo, in summary:  Would I take a date there and spend $150 per person?  NO.  Would I take advantage of another $39 special next year and try something new?  Quite possibly, yes."""""""\n'

aS"Awestruck.\\n\\nThat is how I felt sitting on an overhang just off of the Boulder Canyon trail, taking in the most magnificent view I have seen since moving to Arizona.  Enjoying the pleasant warmth of the sun and the light breeze, it was one of those rare moments where I wouldn't change, well, anything.\\n\\nThe Boulder Canyon trail was my first venture into the Superstition Mountains/Tonto National Forest.  What a great introduction!  I am happy to know that something so enjoyable is less than an hour from my front door.  \\n\\nFirst, the winding section of AZ88 to/from Canyon Lake Marina (parking for the trail) is an experience in itself.  Definitely a take the convertible, drop the top, wind in the hair type of drive.  Woo!  Twists, turns, breathtaking views of the lake and rock formations, plus a couple of one-way bridges thrown in just to keep things interesting.   \\n\\nThe trail itself begins on the south side of AZ88, right across from the Marina, and immediately starts climbing into the hills.  Parts of the trail are a little challenging, with loose rock and a couple of fallen saguaro to maneuver around/over, and a few areas with somewhat steep incline.  Take it at your own pace, you will get there!  (hint:  if your friend is much faster than you and disappears into the distance, take solace in knowing you have the car keys... haha!)  There is a lot to see along the way - cool rocks, huge cholla and saguaro that look like something out of a Dr. Seuss illustration.  Due to the recent rain, everything was much greener than I expected too.  The reward at the peak is more than worth the effort - a panoramic view of Weaver's Needle, Battleship Mountain, La Barge Canyon/creek and the Superstition ridgeline.  Truly spectacular.\\n\\nIf you haven't been here, add it to your to-do list.  Now.  In a couple of weeks, there should be wildflowers...\n"

aS"My first visit to the Grind was a 7pm dinner on a sunday with my 11 year old son.  We're pretty regular visitors to Delux Burger, but we've been hearing about the Grind for a while and thought we'd try it out for a change.\\n\\nThere were many people eating and drinking at the bar watching various games on the flat panels, but there was no wait to get a table.  In my experience staff at some of the other trendier restaurants around town tend to be a bit cool toward patrons with kids, but everyone at the Grind was accommodating and friendly to my son.  Our server took time to answer our questions about the burgers and made recommendations for us.  My son ordered a basic burger and I had the Steakhouse BLT Burger.  \\n\\nThe burgers were HUGE, the meat was very flavorful, both were cooked to perfection, and the presentation was top notch.  We also shared an order of the herbed fries which were a nice compliment to the burger.  Not the best fries I've had, but good enough.\\n\\nAll in all a very positive first experience at the Grind.  Highly recommended for a great burger in a cool atmosphere.\n"

He made sure my brows were not bushy and that no stray hairs were growing out of my ears.  I have not had such a professional and enjoyable haircut in years and wanted to share the experience.

Also O  and  I does have a specialty drink menu. I think the chopped chicken salad is better than the Meditteranean.. The bread they give you is light and served with a thick pesto sauce, and is very delicious. \\n\\nThe patio is great.

aS"I'll be honest, I wasn't particularly impressed the first time that I ate here 2+ years ago. Since then, I've gradually come to really enjoy the food here, and we have gotten an explanation as to some previous inconsistencies with the food here at a certain point in the past (management/cooking staff changes were made). I normally order a two taco combo plate (the shredded beef is what I opt for), and they're pretty good. What really makes this place a win for me personally is their queso dip and their salsa. I swear, I could eat just chips and salsa/queso and be happy if I had to. Anyway, if you're in the Anthem area, this is one of the better options if you're looking to get away from the typical chain restaurant dining that plagues that area.\n"

aS"WOW!! This place is awesome. I love local coffee establishments. The place had a really homey feel to it. The art design on the wall gave the place a unique feel.

Lots of great collection from indie musicians. \\n\\nI ordered the 12oz Mocha which was very delightful to the palette. It was smooth and refreshing, it didn't have that burn taste.

aS"The decor is an odd mix of Arizona ranch and Colorado fishing lodge, with lots of hammered copper, rough-hewn wood shutters, barbwire-etched glass, and antler chandeliers. The cuisine can best be described as Southwestern comfort food with some very gourmet twists. The fondue is a shining example of the kitchen's creativity - a pot of silky-smooth, creamy-rich melted pepperjack cheese is accompanied by rosemary-garlic lamb chops, pistachio bread, and butternut squash for dipping. Other highlights are beef ribs braised in Dr. Pepper, pork shank slow-cooked in beer, and hickory-smoked salmon that tastes like it was grilled on a campfire. Green-chili macaroni and cheese is a house specialty, and deservedly one of the most popular items on the menu, as is the Big-Ass Burger piled high with toppings, but be forewarned - it's served only in the Saloon, which gets very rowdy, especially during happy hour. There's a patio with a fire pit that makes outdoor dining cozy on chilly evenings in the desert. Sadly, this isn't the five-star experience it should be - reservations appear to be meaningless, if the forty-five minute wait we had is any indication, service is abrupt and bordering on rude, and prices are considerably higher than they should be for what you get.\n"

Yep, I orderd a cup of each instead of a soup and a sandwich...seriously, it's THAT FREAKING GOOD!\\n\\nThey make these soups fresh every day, so you call in the morning to find out what today's pot of gold will be. A few weeks ago, I called the day before and not only did they not know yet what the soups would be the next day, I GOT TO PICK THEM! Holy mother of Pearl, did that make me a happy girl! \\n\\nThe standard French Onion is incredible, but the potato leek or corn chowder are also fantastic.

But the food definitely doesn't make you feel cheated. And what I really like about the decor of this place  is the little veggies on the vine as you walk into the front door gives this place a cool vibe. Kind of a modern place. Like the lay out quite a bit. \\n\\nOnly down fall is the seats at the bar are not very comfortable and the do not have a foot rail so your kind of hanging there and the booths can be a bit small if your a big guy like me but that aside this place is the bomb.\n"

Located at the bottom of Artisan condos, it's not a terribly easy place to see if you're driving by. They feature an incredible selection of wines and cheeses, of which you can purchase and take home as well as nosh in the restaurant. They also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night.\\n\\nA particular favorite of mine are the ancho pork empanadas which are fluffy and crispy with a little orange in the pork. They are definitely delicious. Also great is their white pizza featuring sea scallops. \\n\\nThere is nothing here that is oddly unique, but everything is interesting, and it is a nice spot to hang out with friends and have a nice night out.

aS'"""Taste: 5 stars.  The food here is delicious.  I have only eaten here once, but I went with a group of four, each of us ordering a separate dish.  We ordered the honey walnut shrimp, baby bok choy, some kind of chow mein (the name of it escapes me now), and a fish dish.  I opted out of the fish dish but everything else was exquisite and came in decent sized portions.  The honey walnut shrimp had decent sized pieces of shrimp that were cooked nicely.  They were a little tough for my preference now that I think back, but in no way did that impede my enjoyment of the dish.  The sauce spread over the shrimp was sweet but not too heavy and the walnuts were toasted to give an amazing counter balance to the texture of the shrimp.  The baby bok choy was made to perfection, and as a lover of garlic, the dish touched close to my heart with bits of friend garlic sprinkled on top, bursting with flavor that complimented the bok choy perfectly once mastication started in my mouth.  The chow mein was definitely something I was not used to.  The noodles were thinner, fried, and the vegetables on it were in a little bit of what looked like a starchy cream sauce.  A little bland to taste at first, I wasn\'t sure what to think of the dish, but the more I ate it, the more the \\blandness\\"""" turned into an appreciation for the different and simple components of the dish.  \\n\\nEveryone at my table was extremely happy and when we gave our compliments to our waiter, he informed us proudly that their chef was straight from Hong Kong.  He even told us a story about how the chef shakes his head in disappointment when people come in, requesting beef and broccoli and other dishes of the like.  Their response to these requests?  \\""""There\'s a Panda Express down the street but if you want real Chinese food, then stay.\\""""  \\n\\nService:  3.5 stars.  I\'m kind of conflicted trying to score this.  The staff was very nice, the hostess and waiter were extremely polite and both were attentive and very helpful, but nothing seemed extraordinary.  Nothing really seemed to stand out as either good or bad.  They did their job and they did it well, but other than that, there was little interaction.  The best part about the service was the story our waiter told us at the end of our meal.  I really appreciated the interaction he finally gave us but it was after we had already paid.\\n\\nEnvironment:  3.5 stars.  The restaurant is very clean and is separated from the rest of the market enough that you feel like you are actually eating at a restaurant.  They did a great job making a restaurant in the corner of a supermarket but with the cooks tucked away in a room where you can\'t see them and only two people working the floor, I didn\'t get much from the environment of the place.  Maybe it was also because when we went, the restaurant was dead.  \\n\\nLee Lee\'s restaurant is a great place to grab a bite with friends.  I highly recommend going with friends so you can do what I did and split up dishes and taste multiple ones.  I hope that this place picks up in popularity.  The vast population of Caucasians in the greater Phoenix area should add a bit of culture into their lives and give this place a try.  All of the Americanized Asians (such as myself) and all other ethnicities should do the same. \\n\\nBecause the food was so great and that, quite frankly, is what is most important, I am going to round up for my final star total.  \\n4 stars.\\n\\nOh one more note, they only accept Visa!"""""""\n'

aS"I don't usually write reviews whether good or bad, but after my experience with Teri, I felt that it warranted me taking time to write a review.   I feel that good service should be rewarded with a good review.   I have been to many places for microdermabrasions, and Teri has by far been the best.  She took the time to discuss my skin, complexion, and products.  She explained each product she was using and also  sent me home with lots of samples.  I didn't feel like she was rushing through the treatment at all, I felt very pampered.  I have been to other places that rush through my treatment in 15 min.  With Teri, I was on the table for at least 90 min.   I found out about Teri through Groupon and her treatments are extremely affordable.  What usually is $60+ at Scottsdale salons is only $35 for her.   She works out of a cozy, clean room upstairs in Salon XL.  The aroma of the room is laced with lavender and peppermint tea tree oil.

aS"If there was a half star, Centurion would get 4.5 stars.\\n\\nI was slightly skeptical at first when there was just the chef and waitress in the restaurant.  Considering this was a Saturday night, I thought I didn't get the memo that this was a lunch-oriented place and not the place to be for dinner.  I was so glad to be wrong, for once and only for once.\\n\\nThey warmly greeted us as we entered.  We were so hungry that we started out with their cheese plate.  It was a nice assortment of manchego, double-creamed brie, and since i mentioned I loved blue, the chef gave us their blue that was not even on the menu.  You get to choose 3 cheeses out of 6-9 choices.  The cheese plate was nicely arranged with fruits (grapes, strawberries) and nuts.  In addition, he added fig jam and Dijon mustard that gave it a nice kick.  Compared to other restaurants in the valley, it was one of the nicer cheese plates and selections.\\n\\nNext, on to 3 different kinds of risotto (coconut and shrimp, chorizo and manchego, white truffle), which were very rich.  The food just kept coming with our filet mignon, lamb, and halibut (entree for 2).  I know it was a lot of food for the 2 of us but I just had to try it all.  The filet mignon was good but although ordered rare, it was more on the medium rare side for me.  The sauce that was made for the lamb was fantastic; however, I've had a better cut of lamb.\\n\\nIt had a nice ambiance; however, the benches were very high and we had to move to another table.  Thankfully, the chef was aware of the issue and they are anticipating taking care of it.  The patio was really cute and inviting and will be a perfect place to grab a drink (once they get liquor license) after the weather becomes cool. \\n\\nThe chef was very personable and we will be back  to try his recommendation of the Espana pizza.

You definitely deserve the following you're garnering. Plus, I'm glad to see that building put to some good use. Hopefully some other quality businesses will fill in the open spot(s) and we'll have even more reason to make it a destination. A kickass Mexican market would be awesome. There is definitely both the Hispanic and Gringo crowd to support it in the area.\\n\\nAs for the lack of free refills... doesn't that imply that if I didn't drink 1 gallon of tea that I got ripped off? What about all of us 1 big beverage drinkers who are satisfied with the price we pay for our 1 drink. Are we supposed to feel stupid for not maximizing our liquid intake? To me, free refills make sense if you're at a sit-down place that is primarily about food and you're going to be there a longish time due to the food service. For a place that is primarily a coffee/beverage spot with some good food, allowing people to sit and drink free drinks all day would be a bad business decision. If you disagree, open up the Free Refills joint next door. Prove me wrong.\\n\\nPerhaps a compromise is to add a discounted refill to the menu. That will please the regulars who hang out and abuse the T3 and serve those who suck down lots of liquids in a short time.\\n\\n(a T3/DS3? really? i have my doubts that an entire T3/DS3 is being dedicated to this shop. that's enough bandwidth to serve a good-sized office building and host some websites with good traffic. a simple Cox cable connection is a fraction of the cost and often far faster.)\n"

They're currently in the process of putting together two in-house restaurants and I'm excited to try them.  I suspect reviews are forthcoming.\\n\\nMy biggest issue with Lee Lee is the organization.  The aisles are set up by county and that can lead to a bit of confusion when looking for specific products.  Where is the coconut milk?  Why, it's not in the tea and bottled/canned beverage section with the other canned milks.  It's not in the generic canned stuff area.  After a bit of searching, I discovered it's housed with the Thai foods.

This is a major plus for any restaurant keeping the choices changing and the menu fresh.\\n\\nThey have a wonderful selection of breakfast items and baked goods all with a bit of a twist to them that you are sure to enjoy.\\n\\nLunch and dinner feature pressed sandwichwes with fresh ingredents like arugula, basil, fontina and gorgonzolla cheese, balsamic viniger and some of the finest meats to be found on fresh made daily breads. Their wood fired pizza oven puts forth the best pies you'll find this side of Italy with a wonderful crust that is both crunchy and toothful.\\n\\nThe finest carrot cake around for dessert and truly fine coffee. Not to mention the best bowl of hot chocolate on the planet, made from scratch not a can of syrup. Yum!\\n\\nYou owe it to your self to give Liberty Market a try, your tounge and your tummy will thank you.\n"

aS"Solid Pho and spring rolls at the usual low low price. I stopped in yesterday for takeout and got beef pho with meatballs, spring rolls, and a Thai iced tea all for about $11. The Pho came with the usual toppings, all very fresh and plentiful. The spring rolls were big and packed with noodles, shrimp, and beef. My only complaint was that the iced tea was so sweet I'm pretty sure all of my teeth started to rot right there; I couldn't finish it. But I think that's just a personal preference. \\n\\nNo complaints about the food or price, and the staff was friendly. Clean enough place, I would eat there.\n"

aS'"""I went to this place this morning (Saturday) around 9:30am w/ a few of my friends. This place was really busy, people waiting outside (10+ people) consistently. (Always a good sign to a great food joint). So I put my name in at the door and we waited 25 or so to be seated. No problem. The people were all in good moods and atmosphere outside was really nice. (They had a few cement benches outside for those who wanted to sit--only wish they had misters!) So when they called your name, they wouldn\'t just say \\party of 3\\"""" or something they would say \\""""Sarah...are you ready to eat!?!\\"""" It was kind of funny. We entered this small restaurant and the tables had a nice retro feel to them and it was really bright and sunny. On the walls were decorated w/ Disney art (Snow White being my favorite), the Simpson\'s and other fun characters. We sat down and were greated rather quickly, but within 2 mins they came back and asked if we were ready...we were like \'whoa!\' we haven\'t even had a chance to review all the options (omlettes, egg sandwiches, french toast, chicken fried steak ,eggs of course, granola/yogurt..the list goes on...). So we made our decisions, and I ended up getting the \\""""The Mile High - Ham  and  Bell pepper with diced onions and cheddar cheese\\"""" (subsititute - just egg whites) with wheat toast. My friend I believe got the Wolf Pack (eggs, hashbrowns, toast etc) and then my other friend got the Chilaquiles - a mixture of tortillas, ranchero sauce, chicken, sour cream   and  cheddar cheese topped with one egg. All looked mighty delish. \\n\\nMy omelette was so butter-delish and had all the right textures, and flavors you could want. The peppers added bold flavor without adding too many calories, the ham and cheese added just enough salt it make perfect. The toast was normal wheat toast, so not much \'wow\' there. But complemented the omelette very nicely. \\n\\nI would highly recommend this place, I am definitely going back. Just leave plenty of time to wait. (As stated--this happens at any good breakfast spots on a Sat./Sun morning). But they seem to move people in and out rather quickly. Speaking of which....it appears my group of friends over stayed our welcome. After about an hour of us chatting girls, the waiter got a bit upset I think because he couldn\'t turn the table. I guess we should of been more courteous to the others outside waiting in the heat...but we just liked the atmosphere and company so much...we faltered. Please forgive us \'Over Easy\' and when we come back...we\'ll try to not talk to much. :o)"""""""\n'

aS'"""Now that I\'ve dined here twice... I\'m gonna hold Petite Maison at 4 stars. \\n\\nMonday night, 7:30 - my reservation got my party of 2 the last table in the place. (Whew. it\'s so small in there.) The service was fantastic, although it\'s so odd to go to a full restaurant and be given so much time to have a leisurely meal... especially when they\'re full. For example, after the hostess sat us and gave us our menus, about 2 minutes later the waiter came by and after doing his introductory speech, said he would give us a few more minutes to become familiar with the menu... lol... I was ready to give my drink order, but okay! We also had to request the bill. I am pretty sure they would have let us linger with our coffee for a full hour if we\'d wanted to :O   Really weird not to be rushed out! \\n\\nOh, onto the food! The most important part! \\nMy friend ordered the escargot, which, since i\'m very \\meh\\"""" on escargot, I can\'t tell you if they were good or not even though I had two of them at my friend\'s prompting. She also had the trout almondine  - omg fantastic, I\'d order it next time. Whatever dressing they had the salad greens and green beans in, was incredible, and I don\'t even care for green beans, but YUM... I ordered the house salad and the foie gras. The foie gras was very good, certainly the rarest I\'ve ever had it served. I\'m not sure how I feel about the accoutrements - the vinegary accent sauce, the pickled grapes, the roasted apples, on top of a (I felt, a little burned) piece of brioche. I\'ve had better combinations with foie gras, to be honest. But it was still good enough that I ate the whole thing. The salad was also good, I really enjoyed the roasted shallot vineagrette, but to be honest it felt like the salad was missing something... not perfectly seasoned, to my tastes, I think it needed a little salt. :( \\n\\nThe chocolate creme brulee was also my friend\'s choice (I\'d have tried the souffle if it had been up to me!). The creme brulee was good - even great - but I\'m a traditionalist, and while delicious, I prefer non-chocolated-up brulees :) PS - Do not attempt to eat the candied orange garnish on top of the creme brulee. LOL \\n\\nAll in all, despite a few very minor concerns about my meal, I\'ll be back. The bottom line is, the price is right (It\'s amazing how cheap we got outta there, really), the service is fantastic, the atmosphere is cute and cozy, and the food is pretty great. Solid 4 stars. Next time, I\'m thinking that flat iron steak."""""""\n'

aS'"""If I ever have the urge to spend more money on bedding than the current value of my house, this is the place to do it.  I actually learned of The Linen Tree when they were listed as a retailer of Molton Brown bath products on another website.  My first impression was not the best, however.\\n\\nWhen I could not find a product on their website, I asked via on-line chat which was supposedly \\open.\\""""  No one answered.  No worries, I emailed instead.  Again, I never received a response.  At that point I decided if they could not respond to a shampoo inquiry, I would never buy my next set of $777 bath towels here either.  And so I purchased the shampoo from Saks.  And for all you haters that now think I can only use the finest shampoo, it was not for me.  It was for my husband.  And any time a man is interested in any product related to hygiene, I recommend you ladies support him...no matter the cost.  The opposite extreme is far more costly.\\n\\nFast forward 2 weeks and I need drawer sachets as a gift.  So I did the unthinkable and went back to TLT when I struck out elsewhere.  And I am now in love with that store!  Kind of luck my husband.   Didn\'t care for him at first, but he grew on me.  In a good way, not like a tumor.  Anywho, what I found at TLT was a beautiful selection of all things bed and bath...linens, lovely soaps and bath products, accessories, and my drawer sachets.  There\'s also a nice selection of china, table linens and pretty decorative items.  As for the staff, they were very polite and helpful.  I\'m only knocking a star for the rocky start.\\n\\nTLT will definitely be on my list for gift items.  Maybe I\'ll even treat myself occasionally, too!"""""""\n'

Yes, there are lots of kids.  No, nothing will interfere with your comfort, especially in any one of the booths lining both available walls.  The \\vibe\\"""" is just perfect here!\\n\\n*  Their extensive, easy to understand menu gives you plenty of Combination choices,  and  at low prices!\\n\\n*  The chips are terrific,  and  the delicious salsa is just hot enough.  ...

Can you imagine?)\\n\\n*  I have been waited on by \\""""Crystal\\"""" both times that I\'ve been here,  and  received extra friendly, \\""""just right\\"""" service!\\n\\nI had a #14 Combo today ($7.29), which included a Chile Relleno (made with a Big Jim New Mexico Chile), a shredded beef taco, generous servings of refried beans  and  cheese topped Spanish Rice,  and  three hot corn tortillas rolled up in foil on the side.  The food here is a little fiesty overall, but not super hot,  and  it\'s all delicious.\\n\\nThis is a restaurant where everything is right!     :-))"""""""\n'

That said, I thought the lounge was a great addition to the old-town scene. \\n\\nThe number one reason for this Yelp review is the ice-ball. If you don't know, ask the bartender on duty to add one to your cocktail....and it will make your night. Even coming straight from the sports bar scene in khakis and a tank top, I felt welcomed and appreciated at this bar, which seems to cater to all types....both members and non alike.\\n\\nThe staff was top notch -- not too stuffy or self-serving, and I enjoyed the time I spent there. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the great patio area and the live Jazz I saw setting up as I left.\\n\\nI think as soon as more of Scottsdale finds out about this gem, they're going to make it seriously uninhabitable for the likes of me. But if that's their only problem....I think I'll be able to make the occasional exception.\n"

aS"so after having lived in the phoenix area for 2 years, i decided it was high time to finally see some of the restaurants everyone raves about.   This was the first restaurant i was told to try and boy was it amazing.   The wait was crappy but my friend and i just brought something to occupy our time.   Since we are medical students we had plenty of notes to keep us busy. nonetheless, we decided to see what the wine bar was like next door and a couple of glasses of wine later we are all giggles and boy talk.  3 hours later (which is a bit too much in my final opinion) we were seated at the bar and promptly ordered.   We shared an appetizer, spiedini (Italian fontina wrapped in prosciutto with arugula greens) and it was fantastic!! the cheese was perfectly melted and cut by the salty prosciutto and peppery arugula.  As for the pizzas, we each ordered a pizza knowing that we would have leftovers to take home.  I choose the Wise Guy mainly for the fennel sausage and it was worth it!  The pizza crust was amazing, super fresh cheese and the onions were caramelized perfectly.  My friend decided on the Rosa, which she really enjoyed, although we both agreed it was incredibly greasy.   All in all, a fun night away from studying, but is it worth 3 hours of smelling pizza and being starved while you wait? ....That's your call, but i will say it's the best pizza I've ever had in the US and almost as good as the pizza i had in Spain.\n"

aS"I'm a fan!  Acacia Cafe has won my Sunday morning breakfast-eating heart.  I love the the fresh fluffy omelets...light and tasty with fresh crisp veggies and light, nutty, buttered-to-perfection toast that is lined with sunflower and pumpkin seeds...mmmm mmmm.   I'm not sure if the packaged jelly's on the table are their own but they sure taste like it, not too sweet like most commercial types. I've also had their sandwiches  and  salads and you cannot go wrong with those either.  This place is a must visit if you want a yummy, fresh meal at a decent price.  The service can be a bit flaky, but I'm willing to overlook as long as the food keeps coming out hot, fresh and yummy.  Beware, if you sit inside you may smell like breakfast all day...might  be okay if you like that sort of thing.  :)\n"

aS"I first came here as a part of a class trip. We all enjoyed ourselves and feasted on the new and different cuisne that is Thai food. It was here that I first met and fell inlove with Pad Thai. \\n\\nIt was so wonderfully prepared and delicious. I decided I needed to come back someday for more. And when that day finally came, I needed the navagator feature on my cell phone to get there! This place is really hard to find! so keep your eyes peeled and know that's in the depths of a strip mall. \\n\\nThe pad thai was just as good as I remembered it. However, they did serve me bad shrimp. It even smelled bad! I didn't want to eat it. But I took it home to be polite. The deserts are good as well. The coconut ice cream topped with peanuts is surprising to say the least! \\n\\nI say, go! but take a map! Or a navagator if you have it. And be ready to be doted on, but don't expect any free refils on your soda! (boo!) and have a nice time with some nice people eating great authentic food. It was truely a great experience! :)\n"

Just when I thought my hair couldn't look any better, I am always so pleased to learn that yes, as a matter of fact it does every single time I leave Hair Nirvana. Vee is a master at his craft! \\n\\nAfter sharing with Vee (My Hair Stylist) my traumatizing story of hair disasters, I saw Vee listening attentively to every word I said. I explained that since my hair had to be cut so short last time from a previous Stylist's disaster approximately 6 years ago because an undisclosed Stylist was not  being extremely careful to lift my hair color from mousy brown to blond! And so Vee and I's journey began about  6 years ago.\\n\\n Vee, my Stylist really listened attentively and saw my vision of having  beautiful long, silky, golden blond hair (as Vee has achieved). This vision has come true with Vee's patience, and understanding that each strand of my hair must be treated ever so delicately, because it takes years to grow back, so I have no room for error. \\n\\nHair Nirvana has a mysterious Zenlike feel to it! When you walk in you are transcended to a world where your troubles do simply melt away! He has a television that constantly shows beautiful nature scenes along with super relaxing music played at just the right volume. You can choose to chat with him about anything you can think of or merely close your eyes and truly escape the hustle and bustle just outside. \\n\\nI can't say enough how absolutely thrilled I am to have Vee as my Hairtstylist! Today, I can't stop being thankful enough for the beautiful, long, silky, healthy, shiny blond hair I have and I have only Vee to thank for that!  And the compliments, wow, everyone is in awe of my gorgeous locks!\\n\\nThanks a million Vee for making my life that much better now that I absolutely love my hair!!! I seriously have no bad hair days! Just great ones!\n"

aS"Per other reviewers,,this place is difficult to find if just visiting,,not difficult in that it's in an off the wall location or intricate to get to but signage is minimal and its not surrounded by much. If you park in the back and come in through the door that says customers entrance be prepaired to think you walked in through the kitchen becasue you kind of, did.  The host kind of pointed us to our table as others mentioned,,we walked past once and had to ask where he wanted us again,,not a great start,,,BUT,,and its a good but,,the food was amazing. The amount of tastes in this place was like a culinary Crayola box. We stumbled in on 1/2 price wine night which is Sunday-Monday-Tuesday,,,yeeehah!   Nice moderate list to begin with gets downright cheap at 1/2 price, Altos Malbec and Shegesio zin nice. Wait staff took a bit to get to us but was great throughout. Starters were asavado tacos, brie, turkey relleno,,all were very good. I had the blackened pork tenerloins with apple chile sauce,,amazing,,sweet with a hint of heat but overall amazing.  Others had cheese steak, mixed fish grill, Rokerij steak and enchiladas,,all very good. The inside really is a mostly bar with great food so be prepared for some rowdy locals but this place is killer on teh food side and you can go for a 4 star meal in jeans which is what I'm always looking for,,,just a great spot that I will return to in Phoenix any day!\n"

A little explicit, yeah, but it's the truth.\\n\\nI've never been to a Charley's other than the one in Christown/Spectrum (call it what you want) but it is so much fun eating my yummy food and watching all the ghetto people and their spawn mill in and out of the sad mall.\\n\\nThe food here is great.  I always get the Bacon 3Cheesesteak, and it is the best.  You can't ask for more salty goodness than this.  The steak stuff is always thin and juicy with plenty of salt.  The bread this stuff comes on is kind of weird and crusty, but the insides make it worth it.  Do yourself a favor and make it a combo so you can get a drink and a big cup full of fresh and hot fries.\\n\\nI know there quite a few of these around the valley, so if Spectrum scares you, check out one of the other places and get what I order.

I ordered the: \\n\\n- artichoke, tomato  and  basil pizza: really fresh, huge artichoke pieces and nice overall flavor. Does not taste that well when its reheated because you need to eat the veggies fresh, but definitely awesome right off the oven. \\n\\n- sausage, peperoni and cheese pizza: super meaty, super flavorful and just as awesome when you reheated 2 days later. the pieces of mozzarella are whole (large thick slices) and fresh, not the shredded crap that you get elsewhere. full of pieces of sausage and peperoni, FRIGGING GOOD. \\n\\n- the antipasto (fresh mozzarella, salami, olives, peppers, fresh basil and bread): the kalamata olives were really nice, the basil leaves were fresh and the peppers were cooked and had a garlicky taste. the huge slabs of mozzarella were fresh and went well when you added some extra virgin olive oil to it. \\n\\n- canolis: BEST CANOLIS EVER. Super creamy, super crunchy, this dessert made me giggle with happiness. \\n\\n- tiramisu: it was tasty (not the best, but definitely good). the cake part was moist and the cream was good but it lacked the liquor taste to it at the end. \\n\\nOverall, good food and a great alternative to regular pizza.

aS"Another excellent Fogo de Chao experience, every bit as good as meals enjoyed in the the Austin and Chicago outposts.  I will say, though, that the Scottsdale edition might be the nicest looking restaurant of the Fogos I've seen.\\n\\nAs usual, the Picanha (the signature cut) was outstanding.  However, what really caught my attention this time was the Fraldinha, or lower sirloin.  I do not recall this being so good in previous visits, but it was juicy, tender and intensely flavorful.  Of the two fillet mignon offered, the standard (non bacon wrapped) was the best.  Perfectly medium rare, with a beautifully buttery texture.  Sadly, the bacon wrapped version was too overdone.  Although sometimes it's nice to break up the beef parade with some chicken, I am always disappointed.  The lamb and pork ribs, however, are good alternatives.\\n\\nThe salad bar is fresh and abundant, but don't fill up on too many items here.  What's always impressive to me is the huge wheel of authentic Parmesan Reggiano and it's hard not to carve off a few chunks of rich, salty cheese.  \\n\\nSide dishes are typical: mashed potatoes (which are light and airy), fried polenta squares and caramelized bananas.  The latter are particularly nice to give your taste buds a break from the meat onslaught, with the sweetness playing a nice counterpoint to rich and salty beef.\\n\\nAs usual, I will need at least 6 months to recover from this experience.  But, I'll be back.  Just not sure what city it'll be in.\n"

aS"Wow, this was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time. I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I don't like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac  and  cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband's. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didn't like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine. \\n\\nThis place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow. But they were very nice and apologetic, so I gave them a break. I noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space. I was very impressed. I cannot WAIT to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing.\n"

You know the scene where he asks Dante if he can borrow his car keys so he can go to the video store and Dante says \\you work in a video store\\""""and he replies \\""""yeah but I work in a shitty video store\\"""" and then they show him walking into the other video store with angelic music as if he is ascending into heaven ... that\'s the feeling I get when I walk into this place.  A major plus is it doesn\'t FEEL like a chain ... the aforementioned staff recommendations scattered throughout the store give it a cozy feel and make you forget its a chain.  Unlike other reviewers I disagree in that the staff is helpful and attentive ...To me however this is a plus as I\'m allowed to peruse at my own pace and search on my own...yet the only time I asked for assistance (the 8 pack of guiness rack was empty) they promptly filled my request.  I\'m more of a beer and irish whiskey guy as a rule and their choices here are varied and appropriately priced.  One of the only places I\'ve found where you can grab a bottle of powers and I also find the locally brewed cave creek chile beer to be a surprising treat (think a non-shitty corona with a chile floating in the bottom instead of a lime floating on top).  This place has soooo much wine to choose from I\'ve been experimenting again lately ... current faves are zen of zin zinfandel and renwood syrah  If you like booze, cigars and cheap prices this place can\'t be beat even if it is a chain."""""""\n'

aS"I went here recently with a medium sized group for a bachelor party dinner.  We arrived right at 6 pm for our reservations and were seated immediately.  We were given the rundown on how everything works, and then were unleashed.  \\n\\nMy first stop was the salad.  I came in with a plan, go easy on the salad part to leave room for the good stuff (meat) and get some salad fixin's to at least make it seem like it is a somewhat balanced meal.  Overall, I have to say I was pretty disappointed with the salad bar.  The only things that I were really impressed with was the fresh cheeses (fresh mozzarella balls especially).  I guess the pesto salad dressing was nice but most of it was just average for me.  \\n\\nFinished the salad plate, and flipped the red/green card to go.  (Note:  I'm not sure how efficient this system was, there were times when I was green and the gaucho's passed me by, and times where I was red when they asked how I liked my cut).   All of the sudden it was a whirlwind of skewer toting gaucho's, asking if you'd like some of their meat (hmm...that sounds more like a description for a bachelorette party?).  I tried countless different cuts of meats, top sirloin, filet, chicken leg, lamb, etc.  My least favorites were the lamb (did not like the flavor, I usually really like lamb) and garlic meat (can't remember the cut offhand) which was a little overpowering with the garlic (and I like garlic).  The best were the filet mignon and the rib eye.  The other meats I had were also very good.  We were also served some cheesy bread rolls and a trio of sides, garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried plaintains.  I did not try the plantains, but the garlic mashed were uninspired at best (and opposite of the meat had little to no garlic flavor) but the polenta was fantastic.  I had at least three of those suckers.  \\n\\nService was mostly good.  One problem with the meat service is that you get hit with 5-7 different meats in rapid succession, then you don't see another server for a bit.  Kind of feast of famine...  Also, we had one person order an after dinner coffee that wasn't deliver and an error on the check.  I additionally thought that the layout of the restaurant wasn't great, when it was crowded when we left it was pretty hard making it through all the tables when they were full and you had tons of employees running around.\\n\\nI liked it.  I would definitely go back to a brazilian style steakhouse again, though if I went to Fogo, I might go for lunch (starting Oct 1) and save about $20 bucks.\n"

As all the other previous yelpers have yelped about, there is a special $20 deal for a bottle of wine and 4 bruschetta choice topping. The 4 toppings we had was the brie  and  apple w/ fig spread (our most favorite! Easy to make at home too in case you are low on money but feel like being fancy, lol), smoked salmon w/ pesto (pretty tasty), salami w/ pesto (nothing really worth writing about)  and  the warm artichoke spread (was actually good, but would probably want to try another option if I ever come back here again). \\nWell this place also serves soups and sandwiches. The sandwiches are a pretty good big size and are very tasty. The bread they make your sandwiches with are just amazing. I had the turkey sandwich and it was great! My fiance and I also tried some dessert wine (I really love dessert wines only) and we loved the Moscato the best. But $7 for one small glass is not really a good deal. I could easily buy a Moscato bottle of wine for $16 at Bev  and  Mo that has at least 4 servings of wine. But obviously when you're at the restaurant you pay for the convenience and service.\\nWell as other yelpers have said previously, the service is quiet attentive. My water glass was refilled several times throughout our meal. \\nAlso the bathrooms are pretty large and interesting. The decor inside the restaurant has that posh, homey and relaxed w/ low lighting, type of vibe. Also the parking lot is pretty small and so you will have to drive up to do the valet. We tipped the guy who brought us back our car, as I guess that is probably the norm. \\nBut overall, I thought this place had good food, but the price was a little pricey for me (come on' sandwiches and appetizers with 2 glasses of wine for 2 people costing nearly $50? I am pretty sure I could go somewhere else for the same food but cheaper... yes I know some of you may argue that the food won't be as tasty, but I still think it's a little nuts to be paying so much for 2 people for this low fuss food).\n"

aS"What a fabulous dinner at Vincent's on Camelback. Thankfully Chef Vincent G. was in the kitchen  when we recently dined and the meal was absolutely superb. We began with an appetizer of foie gras with Schnepf Farm peaches and a balsamic glaze. A small portion, but if you love foie gras as we do then you will not be disappointed. Meltingly lucious. For a salad I chose the Raddichio with Belgian Endive and it was so wonderful. It consisted of a mixture of chopped raddichio, belgian endive, pears, pecans, and a mild blue cheese in a lovely, mild vinaigrette. I plan to try to duplicate this at home as it was so delicious. My husband had his heart set on a lobster salad but it was not on the menu that night. Not to worry though as our waiter, Dino, said he was sure the kitchen could do one. They did not disappoint. It was a lovely salad they created with big chunks of lobster and heirloom tomatoes. My husband said it was perfect. For our entrees I chose the lobster in beurre blanc with basil pasta. That lobster was  a small one (the waiter said it would be a whole lobster split, but a small one)  but I have to say it was as sweet and fresh tasting as ones I've eaten in Cape Cod or Maine. Just incredibly delicious and the basil pasta was a perfect accompaniment. My husband ordered the duck confit and I have to say after tasting his I'd be very hard pressed to decide which entree I liked best. The confit was served with lyonnaise potatoes. Chef Vincent really did some magical things in his kitchen to give a crispness to the layer of duck fat sitting on top of the thigh and drumstick. We are confit fans but unless you have a gallon of duck fat at home it's pretty hard to duplicate in your own kitchen, plus it's doubtful it would taste as good as this one did. For dessert we both chose the Grand Marnier souffles served with a creme anglaise. Those beauties were ethereal and heavenly....like eating a cloud with a sauce that begs to be licked off the spoon. The service by Dino and the other waitstaff was top notch. We managed to greet Chef Vincent as we were leaving and told him how much we appreciated his genius. This chef is a Valley treasure and if you have not had the chance to try his restaurant you are missing out. He was the winner in the past of the James Beard SW  Chef awards and it's not hard to see why. He is French born and French trained and in my humble opinion NO ONE COOKS AS WELL AS THE FRENCH. We will return as soon as we can. This is still my favorite restaurant in the Valley bar none.\n"

aS"Forgive me Dr. Fitzgerald, my cardiologist, as I have sinned. This was a capitol offense as it was a premeditated artery clogging session after our visit today. A crime of passion. \\n\\nWhile working my way through college as an FTT conductor (long since eliminated) on the El trains around Chicago, I ate a lot of ethnic and soul food. I was 18 years old working summers on the worst shifts possible at all hours of the night, which carried me to some interesting neighborhoods to say the least. In other words, chicken and waffles was not new to me.\\n\\nWhich brings me to my crime today. After receiving an A+ checkup from the good doctor, I made a beeline over to Lo-Lo's. Like I mentioned I have eaten chicken and waffles before, but for the most part eliminated this from the diet. I had also dined here before but it had been a while. In order to facilitate a fresh review, I made my doctors appointment to coincide with a Lo-Lo's lunch.\\n\\nI am happy to report that nothing has changed. Great fried chicken, I had a number six, leg, thigh and waffle with a side of greens to ease the guilt. Unlike many places around the country, specifically in the south that serve sweet tea, Lo-Lo's also has unsweetened which is to my liking. The chicken was served hot, the waffle cooked to perfection. Greens were cooked perfectly, a mix of mustard and collard I do believe. Add some red rooster Louisiana hot sauce, some Trappey's, a little syrup, butter and lord a mighty, my soul was healed.\\n\\nService was with a smile, refills offered before asking, and a team effort. Top notch. \\n\\nSoul food, indeed. The Yelp-fession helps as well.\n"

aS"We had a nice lunch at Herb Box today, and would definitely like to go back and check out dessert - the pies looked really good.  We had a BLT w/pancetta and a fried egg on brioche - very good!  There was what I think was a chipotle mayo on it to make it a little spicy.  Another dish we had was pulled pork served over soft, creamy scrambled eggs w/a green salsa, crispy tortilla strips and served w/flour tortillas.  I can't remember the name, but this is one of the best breakfast dishes I've had in a while.  It was spiced very nicely, I am going to try to replicate that one at home.  To boost the cholesterol, I added had a side of bacon which looked kinda small, but the bacon was quite good.  \\n\\nI should mention the drinks.  I order Arnold Palmers all the time, and theirs is up near the top - more tea than lemonade, and whatever tea they used was brewed very well.  The strawberry lassi, which is basically is a smoothie w/yogurt, strawberries and cardamom, wasn't really that great for me, it seemed too icy (ever after they remade it) with not enough strawberry flavor.  Maybe just not my thing, I don't know.  \\n\\nOur server had a really laid back attitude, but she was fairly on top of it.  Overall, I enjoyed Herb Box very much and would recommend it.\n"

aS'I brought in curtains that I needed some alterations. I needed them in a hurry and asked for same day service but the staff said next day would be the best they could do.

They did a good job on the work and they look great.\n'

aS'"""My boyfriend has been talking about this place since I\'ve known him and today when we were weeding in the yard something smelled like green curry (I know this sounds weird, but this is how my brain works, don\'t ask) and that was it, I had the bug, I needed Thai food. The lady who greeted us was very nice, and was the same person who served us and cashed us out for that matter. Decor was fairly standard for a Thai food place, including the compulsory fish tank right in the middle of the room. My boyfriend had his absolute favorite Pad See Ew. Which he enjoyed as always. I had the Green Curry with chicken. We both opted for the 1 star spiciness, I think the server laughed at that, but c\'mon, I\'m Finnish and French-Canadian here lady, my palate is not made for Thai spice! It was the perfect amount of spicy for me, and that good, creamy, warm green curry flavor. The vegetables were perfectly cooked so they still had that crunch. Maybe it was because I wasn\'t paying, or maybe it\'s because I\'ve been desensitized by East Coast prices but I thought that $24+tip for the amount of food that we got was perfectly reasonable. I think it\'s a solid place. \\n\\nSidenote: I see that most people have responded \\No\\"""" for delivery, however on their website, for this location it says \\""""Call and ask about free delivery\\"""" so I don\'t know if it\'s new, or just lesser known."""""""\n'

aS'"""Egg whites and oatmeal and brizza oh my!\\nI\'ve been hearing about Scramble for months now and I finally made it in for a breakfast meeting today.  I loved it...\\n\\nThe oatmeal was not only the biggest bowl of oatmeal I\'ve ever seen, it was served piping hot with pecans, raisins, and milk / brown sugar on the side.  I also had a side of egg whites done just right.  (I was trying to be healthy since I recently realized I gained some LBS in the last few months).  However, I did have a few bites of my dining companion\'s brizza - it was also delicious!  The coffee did the job too... I left with a nice caffeine buzz and a full tummy too... the perfect way to start my day!\\n\\nI love the clean, urban feel to this place... the staff was super friendly and the bathrooms were clean.

aS"I've got to give mad props to any business that really checks up on it's Yelp reviews!  While I gave Wildflower a positive four star review, I did point out a few things about the location and restaurant that I did not like.  Wildflower's founder, Louis, contacted me to tell me that he agrees with my assessment of the parking situation outside the restaurant, and to show me where customers could find nutritional information and ways to order their meals to fit their dietary needs.\\n\\nWhile stopping in for a soup and half sandwich order for lunch, I decided to try a baked good on this visit.  It was just a chocolate chip cookie, nothing crazy, but I've got to say it was a very tasty cookie.  Perhaps a scone or muffin will be in order next time I drive by.\n"

aS"These aren't the snowcones we grew up with. Kids, adults and even the elderly can enjoy  Bahama Buck's shaved ice (teeth not required). They have any flavor you can think of. I was the weird kid that drank pickle juice from the jar, but if I could have gotten that from a snow cone!? Um.. yes please!!\\n\\nYes the shaved ice is a vehicle for artificial flavors.. isn't that what shaved ice is all about? That's like giving a burger place a bad review because the buns were vehicles for meat.\\n\\nI also recommend getting the cream on top (traditional Hawaiian-style) and getting the vanilla ice cream-surprise in the bottom. Pick a flavor you like, and ask them what they recommend with it.. I wouldn't pick more than 2 or 3 flavors for one shaved ice, but go crazy if you like!\n"

aS"Found it by strolling through Old Town, liked the look/feel from the outside and peeked in and like it even more.  Mah/pop joint for 22 years the last 19 by same two partner's.  Very friendly bartender and server/owner greeted us immediately, as sat ourselves in this small quaint lil joint, most accompanied by locals, but did have the usual tourist of which we are.  Full bar, menu of usual bar/grill fare, but we dug it.  A club sammy and the special today, the pulled pork sammy.  Both solid, not too anything including grease or sauce so that was nice.  Great steak cut fries and potato salad to match.  Bottomless soda and iced tea.  Great place regularly checking back if we wanted anything, if it was to our liking and offering to top off our drinks.  We understand the desert is bomb, but didn't have any room for it.  \\n\\nCheck it out!\n"

I ordered the # 1 (3 tacos and beans and rice 1st taco Lengua   was really good 2nd taco Carne Asada was super good 3rd taco Pastor was good). Out of the three I would get the Carne Asada again really good salsa as well so this is a must stop for any fan of real deal street tacos.\n"

aS'Quaint pizza joint in historic downtown Phoenix. My family tells me this area has really picked up since I left in 2001, and now with the new lightrail, I believe them. Cibo has a lovely patio (perfect for spring/summer, but even w/ the heat lamps it would have been too cold), a cute tiny bar (not much room for waiting), and great thin crust pizza. I like the light feeling of the pizza, but I think it could be more flavorful. Still, for Phx, this place is pretty great. I recommend trying a couple pizzas and sharing. Also the pear salad is fantastic! I think I enjoyed it even more than the pizzas.\n'

I came on a double date, each couple ordering a bottle of wine and bruschetta (arguably pronounced brush-ket-ah) totaling a mere $20 a pair!\\n\\nThe wine selection is fairly eclectic.

They don't make you feel rushed so why should you take on the responsibility yourself?  Just enjoy yourself.

I am not a fan of most novelty pizzas, but this one is just amazing.  I'm pretty sure the bbq sauce they use, is the same one they use at Joe's Real BBQ.  The enormous tree behind the Farm Grill is sick and we always crack jokes about the sign about falling and scorpions.  The line can be a little long, but they are quick at the order window and it is definitely worth the wait.  Don't forget to try them for breakfast as well, mmm breakfast tacos...  Do yourself a favor and walk off that delicious meal through the farm and sneak a grape (when they are in season) that grow on the arbors and fences.  Enjoy and remember to eat local\n"

I had a chicken salad and draft beer....I know I know, salad and beer are not exactly a normal combo...but then again I'm not exactly your normal dude either. Never the less, it was fantastically chemical free. I sat at the bar, my usual m.o., and the service was friggin stellar; hats off the barkeep. \\n\\nAll and all I had a great experience.

It was the first time riding for all four of us (plus another family of three), so before we actually went off on the trail, we all met up at the staging area to sign waivers, get instructions etc.\\n\\nAfter all that smorgasborg, we helmeted up and hopped on our ATVs.  We all started off slow to get a feel of our rides, but before long, we came across our first challenge of taking a dip from the paved road onto the trail.  Everyone passed the test, albeit slowly, and we were off to a stellar adventure (two hours of riding time).\\n\\nAfter a few stop and gos, a few of us felt more comfortable than others, and so our tour guide told us to go in front of everyone so that we could zoomzoom while the others could go at a slower pace.\\n\\nI could tell our tour guide had gone on this trail many times, because he always stopped for everyone to catch up when the paths forked off (or he'd tell everyone to take the left trails), and he knew all of the areas where people had trouble.  He let us (the speed racers) dink around while we waited for everyone else, and helped guide the way for everyone across icky areas (not too many).  He seemed to really like his job (I would too), but he also definitely wanted it to be a fun experience for everyone else, which I thought he provided.\\n\\nIf you feel adventurous and don't mind a little (okay, a lot) of dust on your pants, shoes, jackets, and teeth, take a stab at Stellar Adventures' ATV tour.  It's a little costly at $165/person (our groupon took it down to $75/person), but it was incredibly fun, and I would do it again.  Just don't run into the mountain or flip your ATV over, like one of my friends did!\n"

You have to see this during the day and at night. Some pieces look better during the day and others look better at night. I would suggest going to see this exhibit during the week.

The mom kept bringing me food I didn't even order, just because I told her I would eventually try it.\\n\\nThe food:  I ordered a 3 item combo.  I was really only hungry enough for a 2 item, but for the sake of all of you, got the 3 so I could taste one more dish.  The chicken adabo was very simple and good.  Won't overwhelm you with flavor.  It is prepared using chicken wings, and they were hot and tender.  The spicy orange beef was very good.  Daily special I believe.  Very flavorful, with a hint of orange and red peppers.  Also tried the beef mechado, which I am told is one of their better burritos.  The potatoes that accompanied this surprised me.  I expected them to be a bit mushy, but they were perfectly crisp.  I chose mexican rice to go with it, but I believe they have garlic and white rice as alternatives.\\n\\nThey also gave me some of the cassava cake.  I am not a huge fan of coconut, but I tried and enjoyed it.  Also, they brought out a small sampling of their most popular item, the pork egg rolls.  They were almost like deep fried taquitos with a very unique flavor.  Served with sweet and sour, it is a MUST have!  They supposedly have to make 3,000 PER DAY!\\n\\nGo try it out.  No soda fountain, so you can get canned soda and drinks.  Eat in (cute decor) or take it to go.  Not great for large groups, but 2 or 3 would be OK..\n"

aS"Two years ago, I was very disappointed that I was not able to go to the botanical gardens on a trip to Scottsdale.  However, I think that was a blessing in disguise because I wouldn't have gone there last week and seen the spectacular Chihuly exhibit.  We went to the dbg at five at night, which was a great time, because we were able to see the glass fixtures during in the daylight, at sunset, and then lit up at night.  All the pieces were beautiful, with vivid colors and intricate designs.  \\n\\nThe desert botanical gardens are a little microcosm of the desert world.  We visited Saguaro National Park two days prior and that was real, spacious, and wild desert.  However, if you are only in Arizona for a short time, the dbg will do.  The variety of cacti is so amazing and I'm sure the flowers are beautiful in April and May.  We saw some wildlife there such as rabbits and bees, but not anything like a snake, although I'm sure that's quite possible.\\n\\nWell worth the $!5 fee!  Also, their hours are great if you are looking to do something in the early morning or early evening.\n"

aS"Thai food is one of my favorite types of cuisines. I have been going to Thai Rama for over 5 years now, and they are always consistent! this place is a little, hole in the wall type. (those are usually the best)\\nWhenever I am having a thai fix I usually order the same items. Sometimes different... But not always. \\nOK..\\n1. Thai tea... the best in the valley! \\n2. Pad thai with chicken... level 5 - 5 is usually med spice but to some ppl its very spicy... you can always lower the number to a 1 or 2 and it'll still be just as good.\\n3. Yellow pork or chicken coconut curry with potatoes, onions, carrots,  and  pineapple.... level 5 again.... my fave\\n4. There's one more beef dish that is absolutely delish! But, I forgot the name. Basically all it is, is thick rice noodles and thinly sliced beef stir fried.. Kind of like a chow fun but better!\\n\\nOh and I would also like to add that they have a very friendly waitstaff and pretty good service.\\n\\nIf you like Thai, check this place out!!!\n"

aS"LOVE, LOVE , LOVE this place-as does everyone i have taken here.  The atmosphere is so great.  Big leather sofas, dimly let, chandeliers and HIGE bar in the center of the place.  it's small, swanky, sexy and has a great old school feel.  Plus ladies-i've never seen so many chic good looking guys in one place at once, it was jaw dropping ;)\\n\\nScottsdale needed a place like this-cozy and classy and reasonably priced.  So happy to have this in my backyard-a must try.\n"

aS"I have been going here regularly for about a year. Dave was the first  medium I had ever met. I did a private reading with him and can say that he is the real thing. It gave me a lot of closure. Ray who usually works in the front is very friendly and helpful. \\n\\nSimia who does tarot readings there is amazing. She seems to know things that she couldn't possibly have known when doing my readings. Very specific and accurate. She's very nice too. \\n\\nCatherine does palm readings and it was very accurate. \\n\\nI love the aura photos here. It  comes out on a polaroid film (unlike some other places who use a different type of camera) and is very clear.  \\n\\nOverall a great place.\n"

aS"This was the second stop on our (VinVillage-Phoenix) little wine jaunt through Cave Creek this weekend. The $5/glass happy hour special was a steal. Or if you prefer, get a bottle to share, which several of us did. They have an amazing selection, all handpicked (and probably verified) by the owners. Nancy wasn't there, though I have talked with her before, and she is great - but Bryan kept things moving along for us. Nice interior decor, with some sofa areas and western-themed barstools, and also a quiet patio. Easy to miss if you don't know it's in Stagecoach Village off Cave Creek Road. The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is that they do not serve food - though they will order it from a sub shop across the way (but that doesn't really complement the wine, now does it?).\n"

Weekday evenings it has just the right mood - not over crowded ever - so you are able to carry on a conversation without issue.

I feel like the owner realized that his waitresses were shitty so he found replacements. He also made it a point to stop in and greet everyone at the restaurant which I thought was really nice.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar and service was fantastic. If our server wasn't around, another waitress would even ask if we were doing okay.\\n\\nAs for the food - I have officially given up on RA and moved here because this place was just great! We had the lunch boxes that come with miso soup, cucumber salad, wokked veggies, rice, and your choice of a main dish (regular meat plates or a choice of a specialty roll). We went with the Las Vegas rolls. You get all of that food for $15 and walk out of there feeling full.\n"

aS"I can't believe I've never reviewed this place before. I've been here countless times before, and watched the place get upgraded and remodeled several years ago.\\n\\nI can't remember the first time I came here, but it was some time ago after I moved out here. The convention center has an older part thats smaller, and a new addition that's huge!  Plenty of events are held here all year round, from sporting events like the NBA all star game, to the auto show, they had an NRA convention a couple years ago with a zillion people, along with other regular yearly events like the auto show and several others.\\n\\nThe place is large, and has 3 levels (a basement area, main level and upper level) with a crosswalk to get to the other side which is pretty darn cool. It's huge, spacious, and modern looking with its updates.  Escalators, stairs, etc.  The place is sparsely decorated with Arizona stuff that makes it really cool looking. They also have a cool light feature outside that illuminates the walkway with different colors at night and is really pretty to look at as well.\\n\\nThe cool thing about it is too is that its easily accessible via light rail, and you don't have to spend $$ on parking...and let me tell you, the parking here isn't cheap! $12 for the garage, $10 in lots around, and its not any cheaper the farther away you get.  I don't know why anyone would want to park down here, since the light rail is $3.50 round trip, so save yourself a few bucks and take the rail. You'll thank me later!\\n\\nThere's also food and dining in here as well, with a variety of different style resturants, but again, its outrageously expensive!  They have a starbucks here too, which is their regular prices, but is like an extra $5 a person to eat here, so dine elsewhere before you come in here.  (minus the coffee since Starbucks is the only reasonably priced place in here.)  Plus, the convention center is a hop, skip and a jump from about a zillion other cool dining places that your better off eating at anyways, so do that instead.\\n\\nAside from that, this place is pretty huge, and its worth checking out. Plenty of clean pretty bathrooms and tons to do in and outside of the center with variety of different sized spaces to hold any kind of event, large or small.\n"

aS'"""I\'m a member of the zoo, so I have the opportunity to visit quite frequently.  I do recommend zoo membership to anyone with children or anyone who wants to lose some weight (walking around the zoo is a lot more interesting than walking around the block).  \\n\\nSince I have lived all over the country, I have had the opportunity to visit a lot of zoos:  The San Diego Zoo, The Oakland Zoo, The San Francisco Zoo, The Bronx Zoo, The Tampa Zoo, The Fort Worth Zoo, The Brookfield Zoo, The Lincoln Park Zoo and a few more I am sure I am missing.  Of all the zoos I have visited, I would say The Phoenix Zoo is in the top three, with The Tampa Zoo or The Oakland Zoo (at Knowland Park) being my favorite to date.\\n\\nHighlights of the Phoenix Zoo?  \\n\\nEveryone must see the Orangutan habitat, which is really quite nice.  I love watching the baby Orangutan swing and play; my daughter could watch him all day long.  \\n\\nThe Monkey Village is also a riot.  There are 16 monkeys and only two of them are males.  It is a female dominated society!  Sometimes they even banish the males to the front of the enclosure.  Watch out for falling pee, though.  Those girls like to mark their territory!  Keep your hands off the ropes, for sure!\\n\\nThe Komodo Dragons are also neat, as you don\'t often see those at zoos.\\n\\nThe pedal boats are a fun addition to a day at the zoo ($8 for 20 minutes for members).  \\n\\nThe one thing I don\'t like about the zoo is that you are sort of nickle-and-dimed for things.  For example, just for the kids to touch the Sting Rays, members pay $2 and visitors pay $3.  Also, you have to pay $4 per person to feed the giraffes and children under 12 MUST be accompanied by a paying adult.  At The Tampa Zoo, to feed the giraffes you just need a quarter or two to buy the feed.  And you can stay with the giraffes as long as you want!  At The Phoenix Zoo, you have a limited time \\turn\\"""" to feed the giraffes.  You only get a handful of feed, as well.  It is very disappointing to giraffe lovers like me!\\n\\nOverall, I enjoy the layout and feel of this zoo.  My daughter especially loves the play areas, like the treehouse and the pirate ship.  \\n\\nIt is nice that they open an hour early for members, especially in the hot Summer months.  \\n\\nThat said, you won\'t find me at the zoo at 6 a.m.!  I am still in bed!\\n\\nP.S. Don\'t miss the Galapagos Tortoise.  At feeding time, you are sure to see a rogue hare dart in and out of his enclosure as he slowly makes his way to his food.  The Tortoise and The Hare make a great photo opp!"""""""\n'

The food is simple, well prepared and cheap, and the service is great (super friendly staff).  One of the people in my group ordered the pork chop breakfast.

aS"Kitchen 56 is a nice neighborhood restaurant and they continue to improve.  We went once when it was Vatra and would not have returned had it stayed the same.  The free parking across 56th Street is a nice addition.   As is the new menu.  \\n\\nWe've gone for dinner with the kids in the late Spring, 2011- I had the burger and it was big and delicious.  My daughters giggled with delight when they saw their kid's spaghetti plate- three separate small bowls on a long, narrow platter.  One bowl had noodles, one had the 'sauce on the side' and the other a fruit salad.  Great price at $6.  My husband opted for the Ahi dinner- that was the bummer choice of the evening.  The ahi tuna steak lacked the flavor and texture I expect at $21 a plate.  It was cooked rare, so that wasn't the issue- just cut and quality of the fish.  The wine selection is ok, but the waiter didn't really know the nuances  between the wine by the glass, yet.  \\n\\nThe patio is lovely and nice to see neighbors we know.  Since it is a neighborhood restaurant, it would be nice to be welcomed by the owners or management from time to time.  UPDATE:  I returned for lunch with a girlfriend in May, 2011.  The owner spent quite a bit of time chatting with us and explaining menu choices, their remodel, etc.  She was trained by their general manager and is the day manager.  Nice touch!\n"

The brussel sprouts au gratin were phenomenal and the grilled pork chop was done perfectly.  The service is efficient and not obtrusive.

Me and the girls decided to come here on a Saturday night recently to celebrate her b-day and it was super packed by 9:30PM. This place is definitely a little gem and the ambiance very surprising when you walk in. I love that most of the time it\'s just dark enough and there\'s usually a good mix of music playing; I also love that there is always an eclectic mix of people here ranging from people on first dates, b-day parties, to \\that guy\\"""" trying to look cool at the bar.  After living in Vegas for 7+years I can say that this is actually a real lounge. I\'ve found that many places in AZ claim to be lounges but when you walk in it\'s a full on club with super loud music and people dancing every where and little to no seating. At Mer Bar there\'s plenty of seating and the music is just loud enough to create that lounge like setting but you can actually hold a convo. \\n\\nBe advised that the drinks are not cheap! A specialty cocktail or martini goes for minimum $12 a pop so be prepared. Their food selection isn\'t that large so the only thing I\'ve tried was their cheese and cracker platter which was perfect to snack on. Service is pretty hit or miss, on our last visit there was only 1 lady working the entire place, she said the other person called in but we had no complaints since we were having an awesome time chatting.

aS"The tacos at this place are little bundles of goodness that are damn near perfection. To begin the carne asada has great flavor with a slightly charred and crispy exterior, but still manages to maintain some tenderness on the inside. The cabbage, guacamole, and salsa are a necessary addition to this masterpiece of a taco. And just when you think you have it all... bam! Grilled onions complete one of the best tacos in Phoenix. On top of it all, these bad boys are only $1 a piece. \\n\\nNow on to the less glamorous side of Taqueria Los Yaquis, or the underbelly if you will. The establishment is inconspicuously housed just west of 7th Ave on Camelback Rd under a tent with some plastic tables and sporadic misters outside of Charlies gay bar. Here you will find some flaming fairies and hordes of legit Mexicans flocking in from all angles. Once you reach your destination you can watch the cooks working tirelessly in a food truck (one of the cleanest I've seen) to prepare you meat-filled pockets of love. God bless them. \\n\\nThere are two ordering lines: one is literally a hole-in-the-wall inside Charlie's and the other a general line outside which accommodates all. This dual line and alternating order-taking results in ridiculously long waits of up to 20-30 minutes. I prefer to go on Sunday afternoons when it gets real, and a lil' less... uh... gay.\n"

aS"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place!  We were DEFINITELY skeptical of coming here because well, it's a Thai AND Sushi restaurant.  Unless it's some sort of fusion place, we normally stay clear of restaurants that offer two different styles of food at one location (like those restaurants that serve Chinese and Mexican!)  We are SO glad we looked past our issues!\\n\\nWe've been back three times now, and let me tell you, each time has been consistently good.  The first two times we had appetizers and sushi.  They really DO have one of the best happy hours around - half priced apps AND pints of Kirin - DRAFT (i can't remember - I believe for $3.00).  The main point being Kirin on draft!  There is such a difference between Kirin out of a bottle and fresh from a tap, and it's so awesome they have it here! Score!\\n\\nThe appetizers were all awesome - fresh spring rolls, chicken satay, tempura - all very generous portions.  Miso soup was as it should be - comforting and light - and not too salty!  Then, we ordered our sushi.  The rolls are generous, the himachi and salmon was super fresh - and the sushi chef was super nice and accommodating.  Super creative sushi - some of which I have never seen before!   We are definite fans!\\n\\nThe third time we came here - we were ready for some Thai!  My fiance, our friend and I ordered apps to share.  Our friend ordered the Thai Basil with shrimp - and he was crying.  He said it was super spicy but super good.  I did not try his dish but could tell by the tears falling from his face he was not joking.  My fiance and I shared the glass noodle dish. We LOVE glass noodles - and they were cooked perfectly. Not too sticky or starchy, with just the right amount of spice.\\n\\nThe decor is truly gorgeous, and everyone is soo super nice here.  The one bad thing is that Narai is consistently empty. It is deceiving - being located in the same plaza as Four Peaks brewery when you see a ton of cars in the parking lot.  But most of the cars are for the brewery.  The restaurant has been empty everytime we've dined here - which really scares us because we'd hate to lose such a North Scottsdale gem!  I can't stomach places like Ra, or Kona Grill.  It's so refreshing to have an authentic sushi and Thai restaurant in the area!\\n\\nI would highly recommend trying it out!  With so much variety and such a friendly, helpful staff - you're bound to find something you like!  If not - just have a happy hour beer! ;)\n"

aS"Now I wish I would have actually gone to pick up my samich instead of sit at work and wait for it's arrival.  I had heard very good things about this deli, so when i finally got bored of the same ole lunch I bring to work every day it was time to get in on this following.  I had the italian sub on wheat bread.  Um, talk about Freshness!  I'm pretty sure I ate the whole thing in like 3 minutes because I just couldn't get enough.  The bread was so soft, the meat was outstanding, and the provolone was real!  Alll it had was oil and vinegar on it with lettuce tomato and the typical italian meats.  I normally cannot eat a sandwhich without mayo and mustard, specially some spicy brown.  That was wonderful, but now after reading these reviews, it's time for me to check out that Chicken Salad, I love chicken salad.\n"

aS"True Food is awesome. It's great to find a place that has really good HEALTHY food!! Have been here on many,many occasions and it's always been a great experience. The shrimp and goat cheese pizza is a favorite but I've really liked everything I've had here with one exception...the butternut squash ravioli, I could do without this dish. Service is friendly and helpful and I dig the patio when it's cool enough to sit outside. Sam Fox seems to know how to do it up right. Thumbs up!\n"

I was commuting to Litchfield Park to get my Western bacon cheeseburger or famous star fix.....\\nWhat is even more interesting is the fact that the new Carls Jr in surprise has all new staff and they must have been trained to be polite and courteous???  Not that often that I stop at fast food and get super polite and courteous from the teenager employees.  \\nWhen I think Carls Jr, I think big sloppy burgers, forget the diet and dig in.  Plus who can pass up a $2 bacon western burger?  Bacon, fried onion rings, barbecue sauce, cheese, and meat?  Can't really ask for more?  I workout out to eat stuff like this :P\\nEnjoy it.....\\n\\nOff of Grand in the Lowes parking lot, tricky parking lot location, but worth navigating the yellow bumps and arrows to get to Burger heaven.  Yes Carls Jr makes the best fast food burgers :)\n"

aS"Ok, so I discussed it with my dad, and decided to give this place four stars ( I was going to give it five stars, but he convinced me that it wasn't 'special' enough to get five stars and then I decided that I would need to go again before making that decision. \\n\\nAnyway, I met my dad here for lunch yesterday at around 11:30 and the place had some customers, but wasn't crazy busy. We sat outside, and that was very nice. We decided to split the caesar salad with chicken and the chicken sandwich with the goat cheese and fig jam. The caesar was really good, the dressing tasted excellent and was tossed perfectly, and the chicken was also very flavorful, but the whole thing still had a light quality to it. It was tasty. The sandwich was also very good. I could taste each ingredient, which I like, the bread was good, crispy but soft at the same time, and the combo of flavors was really great. Also, the service was excellent, my water was never empty. \\n\\nSo I would most definitely come back here. I just think I need to try dinner here and some more complex dishes than what I got before I can give it five stars, but honestly, as far as sandwich places go, I liked this very much, better than pane bianco.\n"

aS"Started my meal with the Stetson chopped salad. Absolutely brilliant, wish I would have thought of it myself. A memorable presentation and a must order. Next came the duck con fit relleno. A valiant effort but the mallard was too overpowered by the pepper and batter. For the main course I selected the exotic mushroom pan fry.  Beautiful variety of mushrooms, swimming in a savory gravy that mimics the loveliest Yankee roast that you've ever had. A meatless Friday would never be easier.\\n\\n A fun, eclectic, Scottsdale eatery.\n"

It took all of 15 minutes even with picking out a totally new foundation then I used before.\n"

aS'This place is a bit rough around the edges, but worth the adventure.  They have really good fried food, especially the shrimp.  The prices are decent and they have a bunch of different sauces.  My suggestion is to mix the Louisiana hot sauce with the ranch.  Employ that for all of your dipping delights.  If you are health-conscious or looking for a nice place to eat, then this might not be the place for you.  If you down for greasy goodness in a low-key setting, then this is where you should dine.\n'

aS'"""Garrett did a fantastic job cleaning and detailing my vehicle. I have a 2012 Subaru WRX Sti and wanted to make sure the paint was maintained properly with a good washing and sealant application. Ive had several cars in the past ranging from Supras, M3, GTO, etc, so i\'m somewhat of a car nut. I\'ve also had some pretty sub par experiences with \\other\\"""" mobile detailers here in the East Valley. They would charge you and arm and a leg ($90-$100) and would only take 1 hour to complete the job using 1 person. Now im not an expert at math or anything, but unless they had more than 2 arms, a QUALITY detail sure as heck takes more than 1 hour, i know this from doing them myself. Quality work takes time, especially if you want it done right.\\n\\nGarrett was easy to work with, we set a time of 6am to start before it starting heating up outside. He showed up on time at 6, introduced himself, and started to work. Everything he has is self contained, so its very professional, he has everything he needs to complete the job. We discussed over the phone that it would take 2-3 hours to complete the detail because he had to use the polisher to apply the sealant. I would rather pay someone good money for a complete job, rather than a half assed job because they wanted to get done quickly.\\n\\nHe had great attention to detail and even used some cutting compound to remove some surface scratches i had not previously noticed. Overall a great experience and great quality work for this price, especially for the time he takes, also dealing with the Arizona heat. Highly recommended!"""""""\n'

They have the brewery and a tasting room/restaurant like the one there in Tucson too. \\n\\nThat being said when I first came in my my Cats shirt the waitress said \\go cats\' and I felt like I was at Nimbus in Tucson:-). My wife is a Sun Devil so she wasn\'t so impressed.\\n\\nWe had a GROUPON for 2 salads, 2 beers, and 1 pizza. Great deal for 15 bucks. We decided on Mac n cheese pizza, rye IPA, old monkey shine,and garden salads.  What can I say? The beer was great!!! And the salads were surprising good. The man n cheese pizza stole the show though. It was amazing. Yes bacon man n cheese on a pizza! \\n\\nDuring our first trip here they were playing Monday night trivia and we watched the Packers and Seahawks and the end of game call!  Fun time. \\n\\nWe went here the next week after at the end of the UofA game. Too bad they did not play the game here. Some drama with PAC 12 and DirectTV.

aS"Anyone who knows me well knows that I hate grocery shopping. Hate it. Recently I was introduced to Trader Joe's and this past weekend, I took my husband there for the first time. While I can't say I have fallen in love with grocery shopping, I have found that I can at least go to TJ's when need be.\\n\\nThe layout of the store is fabulous. It's just a big enough store to give you variety and some choices, but not big enough to overwhelm you, especially if you are not a seasoned grocery store veteran. The staff is very friendly and always willing to help you find something, and the check out clerks are chatty without being annoying. I really can't compare TJ's prices to those you would find at a regular big box grocery store, but according to my husband who does all of our grocery shopping and knows which stores are the best for certain items, he says that TJ's prices are comparable if not lower than other grocery stores.\\n\\nI like the pre-packaged salads, sandwiches, and wraps, which are perfect to take to work for lunch. In fact, I had a TJ's chicken caesar wrap for lunch today and it was delicious! Do make sure to check the dates before purchasing to ensure that if you aren't going to eat it that day that it will last for a few more days. The organic pesto pizza that can be found in the frozen section is also very good and just the right size for two people. I was a little disappointed in the Red Delicious apples that I bought (nicely priced at 49 cents each)...they didn't have the crunch to them that I appreciate, but I'm not sure if it was the quality of their selection or that I just did a crappy job of picking two apples.\\n\\nThis TJ's does seem to be quite popular especially given it's location in the same shopping center as Changing Hands and Wildflower, so if you go on a Saturday, I would suggest going early. We arrived at 11 am and it was quite busy and the parking lot was almost full.\n"

aS"150th Yelp Review!! WOOT WOOT!!! \\n\\nIt's a Sunday afternoon date, which was nice because the weekend was action packed for me, so a lunch date was just right. He picked the place, I do like that when the man picks the place and he even scores big points with me because it wasn't a chain restaurant, not that he would know that I'm on this only eating at local places  and  Yelp about it mission this year lol. \\n\\nI didn't ask him where we were headed but was pleasantly surprised because we were at the Cofco Chinese Cultural Center, never been and have always wanted to go check out, was kinda disappointed in how small it was. Walked around and checked out a few things still wasn't sure of the reason we were here, then we walked into Szechwan Palace and I thought gosh this is cute little place.\\n\\nFrom the time we walked in I got the feeling he was a regular their and wondered how many of his dates he brought here LOL The ladies were happy to see him and were talking with him, I of course had no clue what was being said cuz they all were talking in Chinese.  \\n\\nGot to our table, had a very hard time trying to figure out what I wanted to try, I found lots of dishes that I wanted, he order chicken fried rice, I would up ordering mongolian beef extra spicy. Order came out and it smelled delish, and being a crazy obsessed yelper that I am I picked up my phone, turned the plate around to the best view and started to take pictures of the dish, date looked at me funny but didn't ask, guess his other dates don't take pics of their food LOL I could see the coating of the red chili oil on the beef and onions, the beef was tender and onions and peppers were perfect, only thing it was missing the heat of the spice. But I finished the entire dish, it was that good!  Next time I want to try beef with jalapeno, I bet that dish packs some heat!\\n\\n I look forward to coming back and trying out more of their menu, glad to have finally made it over to the cultural center! Food was delish, date went well, and it was a good day. Also when I checked in on Yelp, was offered a free desert with any entree, I'm saving that for another time!\n"

aS"Had a great time on Friday night.  As my friend and I walked in she said it feels like a great place.  It had a warm and friendly atmosphere.  I don't remember the name of our waitress but she was great. We ordered beer first and I asked the waitress to surprise me with one she likes. That started off the fun.  She chose a very good one first, and an equally good one for the second and last.  My friend and I both had the fish and chips because we thought that would be a good choice for a British pub.  The dinners were very good.  The fish was battered just right, the. Ole slaw was perfect, and the french fries were not overdone. So the first time there was better than I expected and we will come back again and again.\n"

A rather large group of us went in at lunch time and were seated quickly and served just as fast.\\n\\nMost of us ate from their weekday lunch special (about $8 per plate).  The lunch special comes with soup and an egg roll.\\n\\nThe ambiance is nice.  Like a few other reviewers have suggested, you can't really guess what you're getting into from the strip mall appearance outside.\\n\\nOur waiter was nice and attentive.  He walked the fine line between participating in our group conversation and being creepy really well.\\n\\nThere are a few Thai places in this area, and Tottie's is one of the better.\n"

aS'I am going to start this off by saying that my past experience with Pho has been less than satisfying.  I didnt really think I would like the stuff on the third try, but I am one of those kinds of people that is too stubborn to dislike food and I have to keep trying it.  You know - just in case the places I ate at before were terrible.\\n\\nToday, that mentality served me well.\\n\\nI had avoided the previous tenants of this particular location like the plague, due to their reputation for poor customer service, etc.\\n\\nNew company, new attitude.  The wait staff was very attentive and polite.  There was light classical music playing.  The restaurant was very clean.\\n\\nI had the Pho Tai Bo Vien with Jasmine Hot Tea.\\n\\nThe tea was hot - but not so hot that I couldnt begin drinking it right away.\\n\\nThe Pho was delicious.  Not to greasy.  Very flavorful.  The sprouts and basil that were served with it were fresh and crisp.\\n\\nAll in all, for 11 bucks, this was a good meal.  There are many other items on the menu that I would like to try, and the manager informed me that the menus is being expanded.  I will update this review in a few weeks.\n'

aS"This place has great bread. Really fresh and chewy. The food is served fast and the price seems to be pretty good as well. The only 2 things that keep it from a 5 star is that the subs seem to lack originality, and they don't deliver late-night at this location. It reminds me a bit of Silvermine Subs and is maybe even a little better as far as taste.  The lettuce wrap subs are very original to this place. Although I would never eat one, my girlfriend was a fan.\n"

aS"so we wanted Chinese, and decided to eat at the restaurant. What awesome service. We started with the potstickers ($4.95). They were lightly pan fried. Perfectly chewy with a nice crisp on them. Wifey went with her go to dish, the amaaaaazing Singapore rice noodles with BBQ pork and Shrimp (8.95)  This dish is EASILY enough to feed three people. (yes, she brought most of it home) I went with the salt and pepper pork chops. If I could marry chinese food, this would be my bitch. Holy cow. Awesome thin cut pork chops breaded, salted and served with jalapenos and chives. I don't ever ever ever eat fried foods, but these were seriously one of the best chinese pork dishes ever. Overall, great great great. Super stoked that this place is right around the corner.\n"

The idea of Chinese - Latino food sounds odd, but I'd heard of it before and just never had the chance to try it.

They are also usually on sale too, which makes me happy (and even when they're not, they're cheaper than other places). Other things that make me love Sprouts: their corn muffins are delish, they have a regular bulk section, but they also have a bulk spice section. Who wants to pay friggin $3 for a tiny jar of spice, when you need a tablespoon for a recipe you're trying out? \\n\\nI assume they also have a good deli because I see people getting the lunch special here, but I've never tried it.\n"

Purchase your tickets on-line  and  arrive at least 1 to 1 1/2 hours before your show time. It\'s first come first serve so you don\'t want to end up in the back. You need to be prepared to sit in close proximity to others, in other words, if you\'re a \\respect the bubble\\"""" type of person, you might want to rethink your choice. If you\'re with a large group you all need to purchase your tickets together so that you\'re seated together, or call the box office to see what they can do. The menu has been simplified, there\'s not much to choose from, but the food is decent  and  counts towards your 2 item requirement. If you\'re easily offended you can check out their Sideshow Cafe (I think that\'s what it\'s called) were the comedy is appropriate for all ages. Every time I go there\'s at least one person with a bitter beer face  and  I just assume they are generally unhappy people, because the show is good!

Starting right when we walked in, the guy working the counter was quick to tell us about the different specials going, and even set up a bowling ramp, provided lighter kid's bowling balls, AND put up the bumpers for my 5 year-old without me having to ask. The place is pretty big, with AT LEAST 34 lanes (we were 33 and there was at least one more to our right), the snack bar, an adult bar, and an arcade with pool tables.

From the coffees (Four Barrel Coffee), to the organic milk from Strauss Creamery, and the pastries and breads from Tammy Coe and MJ (I think that's where I remember them telling me these were from)...totally worth it.\\n\\nSpace/Environment: LOVE the giant (pardon the pun) open front, the various options for seating, the free wi-fi, the music selection, and the fact that Matt and Erenia (the owners) regularly pop in and talk to their customers. \\n\\nThe not-so-great things (there are only two): The hours aren't great - YET. Tues/Sun 7AM to 3PM. But they say they'll be open 7am to 7pm starting 6/15. Nice! They only take cash right now. Hopefully they'll get with the program and start accepting debit/credit soon. I rarely carry cash with me and it sucks to have to stop at the ATM just so that I can go get a cup of coffee. Still, for Giant, I'll do it.\n"

aS'"""Wow. If you like music, you will LOVE the MIM. This place is amazing! Perhaps I should say if you like music OR architecture, you will love the MIM. This is the kind of place that as you walk through, you mutter to yourself, \\I can\'t believe I am in Phoenix!\\"""" The MIM now is affiliated with the Smithsonian Museums, and after touring the facility, you will agree that is a perfect partnership.\\n\\nI don\'t want to repeat what has already been said on the great reviews, so instead I will just reiterate that you really need at LEAST three hours to see the MIM. That three hours will mean you have not seen everything, but it\'s a start. The MIM has a really nice cafe with limited hours, but has a coffee shop which is open throughout the day. In addition, there is a gorgeous music venue which you can take a peek at while on your adventure. It looks like a perfect place to catch a show, and much like the rest of the MIM, it is eye candy.\\n\\nThe staff at MIM are very knowledgeable and super friendly. The audio system you wear while on your musical quest is really outstanding. The sound was superior, and makes Bose look like dollar store speakers. Lastly, don\'t miss the gift store, there are tons of great items there, and I found my Mom a little Mother\'s day gift. DO NOT MISS seeing John Lenin\'s piano which he played Imagine on. It will give you goosebumps!\\n\\n Hope you enjoy your visit."""""""\n'

I come here with a game plan... start with cheese appetizers and end my meal with every dessert they have to offer. But my plan always fails. I can't start slow, this buffet is way too exciting.

aS"I've driven by this spot so many times on the 17 and finally decided to look it up on yelp.  Based on the mostly rave reviews my boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot.\\n\\nFirst off I was really excited about the mac n cheese since so many people said it was amazing.  I was severely disappointed and agree with another reviewer who said it tasted like velveeta.  I'm convinced that's exactly what it was.  The beans tasted like watered down canned baked beans.  Okay, now that the bad is out of the way let me tell you about the good.\\n\\nWe ordered the Q rolls as recommended and we weren't disappointed.  Both sauces were tasty.  We couldn't decide on what to get so we went with hog heaven to try a bit of everything.  We chose the St. Louis ribs, the beef ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Our sides were mac n cheese, beans, and roasted corn.  We had to ask for cornbread.\\n\\nThe cornbread was good, on the caky side but still good.  The roasted corn was very good, I recommend it.  The brisket and pulled pork were definitely up to par.  I grew up on both.  They weren't quite my dad's, but still worthy of recommendation.  Both ribs were fall off the bone.  I hadn't has St. Louis ribs before and I wont get them again.  They were on the spicy side, which I personally don't prefer.  The beef ribs were very tasty and I would order them again.\\n\\nAfter waiting for some boxes we started to look around at the other tables.  The baked potatoes look awesome, stuffed to the hilt of goodness.  They also had vegetables.  No mac n cheese or beans in sight.  We'll definitely follow suit next time.\\n\\nAll in all we were pleased with the experience.  The main food was done right and the restaurant and atmosphere was great.  The service was definitely to our liking.  The 10% off from yelp was also a bonus :)\\n\\nWe are both huge fans of honey bears and their sauce, although as of late the ribs haven't been fall off the bone.  We are considering buying honey bears' sauce and getting Bobby Q's beef ribs to go without the sauce.\n"

This long time favorite provides a great comfortable, unpretentious atmosphere...surprising since it is in the middle of a Tempe industrial park.

And that spaghetti calzone...let's just say that I wouldn't be surprised if other smart pizza joints don't start making it.\\n\\nLike everything else, there is more than one way to enjoy pizza. This isn't your typical wood fired Neapolitan, coal fired New York, or Chicago deep dish.  It is somewhat unique, it is very memorable, and it is should have a comfortable home within your pizza shortlist.\n"

aS"I've only been to Verde once (SO FAR!), so take this with a grain of salt.  But on that visit, Verde impressed me.  A lot.\\n\\nIndoors is clean and decorated in a trendy, urban, utilitarian style. There was some audio equipment on shelves in a corner, and I wondered if they have a karaoke night or something.\\n\\nTheir menu isn't huge, but what they do, they seem to do well. The sauces were fresh and full of a ridiculous amount of flavor. I ordered the green chile, thinking it would be excellent, since the place is named after it.  So I shouldn't have been surprised that it was the best I've had in recent memory, but I was. Tender pork, fresh-tasting verde sauce with the right amount of spice. \\n\\nBut wait, there's more: even the rice and beans were fantastic. How many places put much thought or effort into a side of rice?\\n\\nMy friend had one of the taco dishes, and we noticed that the salsa that came with hers was completely different than the one that came with mine.  Both were fantastic.\\n\\nIf I have an experience on a future visit inferior to this one, I'll adjust my rating and edit my review ... but I don't see that happening. This is already one of my favorite downtown restaurants.\n"

aS"Just do yourself a favor and go here and get the sliders, they are fantastic!!  I think the soft and chewy roll is what makes them so damn addictive!!  I have actually never tried anything else on the menu because all I know is that when I go here all I want is sliders!!  The decor of this place is really cool as well.  All stuff Chicago sports.  Although I'm not a fan of Chicago I understand this place.  If a place like this existed in Phoenix that had all things Boston I would love it!  I really don't have much more to say though about the place since I have only tried one thing but I will say this.  The staff is friendly and if the the Cubs ever win the World Series, it's free sliders!!\n"

aS"Moved from Miami to Scottsdale recently. Every salon in the area I've checked out has quoted me for mani/pedi $80 +. In Miami everywhere you turn there is a nail location, although mainly they speak there native tongue and barely converse with you. I found Elite nails to be pretty impressive for a first timer. The women at the counter greeted me with a smile, took my name, thanked me for being early, asked  me to pick my color. By the time, I finished choosing my color my tech was ready for me. I was again greeted with a smile by Tiffany- a 20 something yr old that did a phenomenal job on my nails! Cuticles were cut perfect, although the calus rock scrape could have been a little longer I have to say I was definitely satisfied. She spent an hour and a half on both my hands and feet and we conversed like we had been friends for years. Did I mention, I was given my own set of nail clippers and tools from a sanitized closed packet?... No nail fungus, used tools that are not kept clean and/or sanitized properly. I'll be seeing them again soon.\n"

aS'Their bread is awesome!! Its made fresh every night! You can actually drive by around 9pm and see them making the bread. They have different breads daily but have some daily. Unfortunately their hours are pretty short so definitely get in there. You can taste several of their breads everyday so the more you go in, you can taste test before buying the whole loaf. And when you buy 8 you get one free. Great deal! You can check out their website for all of the breads they have in detail daily.\\n\\nhttp://www.breadsmith.com/locations/mesamenu.pdf\n'

aS"I have been going to Champs Salon now for 10 years.  It's amazing how time flies.  Originally I started going to Champs to have my nails done (by Mandy Evans).  She came highly recommended; and is a lot of fun.  Within the year; I also started having my hair professional colored and cut (by JT; also excellent). \\n\\nNow a days our whole family has some kind of service there; whether it be cuts or hair shaves for the men or color and nails for the girls. Both Mandy and JT have done so much work for us, onsite and off.  For my daugthers wedding, JT came to the hotel and did everyones hair for them.  For MY wedding; JT trained Mandy and my daughter how to style it (wedding was a in Rocky Point).  Mandy then came down and styled my hair and my flowergirls; along with generally assisting with everything. \\n\\nOver the past 10 years we have gotten to know everyone at Champs.  Most of the girls here have been here for longer then this even.  They are very professional, and concientious.  They stay up to date with new processes and products. \\n\\nThe worse I can say is that it is sometimes hard to get a last minute appointment because Mandy and JT are so busy; but I find that it works better to schedule in advance and not spur of the moment. \\n\\nAll their work is excellent AND guaranteed satisfaction!\n"

aS"LOVE THIS PLACE! I was introduced to them because of a Yelp event held there recently but I loved it. The patio front and side are awesome. Now that the weather is getting a little cooler here - I can't wait to go there and participate in one of my all-time favorite pastimes ... drinks on the patio! It's a perfect venue. The parking garage is right across from the entrance. So easy! Oh, and the food was wonderful as well :)\n"

aS"Some friends and I started going here a couple of months ago after our old wine bar shut down. I've been very happy with this new place we are starting to call our new wine home. \\n\\nThe wine prices are good and they have a nice selection of beers as well if wine isn't your thing. The staff is friendly and service has always been good for us. They also have a wine club that is well worth the money. They offer a full calendar of events each month from wine tastings to live music. Just want something to munch on while sipping on some wine? They offer some nice cheese trays and chocolate trays too...if you want something more they will allow you to bring in your own food (as long as it's not what they sell there). \\n\\nI'm happy we found this place and have started making a weekly trip here.\n"

aS"1 Dollar hot dogs and 1 dollar soda and beer?! \\n\\nYippee!\\n\\nWe went to watch the sharks game and yes i love the sharks because i am from San Jose.  Duh!  I am slightly disappointed I did not try any food the buffalo wraps apparently didn't have much buffalo sauce and tasted like little dribbles of the red hot sauce so I in no way wanted to eat a nasty wrap that lacked the kick it desperately needed.  How many times do you here that about buffalo wings? Not many.  The dollar hot dogs didn't look the best but you can tell why they are or were a dollar.  \\n\\nIf I could bring my own food and desserts and drinks Id be in my own kind of heaven.  But then again you can go to a restaurant out side of the arena get completely full and slightly tipsy so you can really enjoy the game! That's be a Stellar time!\\nWhy pay more for mediocre food when you have restaurants outside of the entrance?\n"

aS"Beautiful Justine, the owner, seems to always there in a slinky dress and 4'' high heals (Ole).  She makes you feel like you have known before you've ever met.  She is a friendly host and smiling all the time.  \\n\\nMy two favorite things are: \\n - the long beans and \\n - the beef salad.  \\n\\nAlthough the food is vietnamese, it seems more exotic.  I never get Pho here, which is my standard at all other Vietnamese places.  I guess I am too focused on the items above to even ask about Pho.  \\n\\nYou can also bring your own bottle wine and open it at the restaurant for a small cork fee.\n"

aS"This is not very far from my home, but for some strange reason, I have never visited there.  Maybe because we don't have New York Deli's in Spokane, and I'm not familiar with the idea.\\n\\nThe other day, I agreed to meet my son and little granddaughter there for coffee and a bagel, and found that it is much more than just a bagel stop.  They actually have a restaurant with quite an extensive menu.  I had breakfast - the choices were very diverse - including skillets, various pancakes, bagels (of course), french toast, omelets, and a number of other items.  The servings were large, and the service very prompt and friendly.  Most importantly, the prices were more than reasonable.\\n\\nThe only thing that I disliked, was that they did not have hash browns.  They do have potatoes as an option with the meals, but you cannot actually classify them as hash browns.  They are good - but not quite a replacement for hash browns and gravy.\\n\\nI actually like it so much, that I stopped and had breakfast two days later on the way to the golf course.  Again, great breakfast at very reasonable prices.  Although I usually don't eat lunch, I am going to have to make an effort to stop in and try their lunch menu. And their deli counter, and all the different varieties of bagels.\n"

aS"Had started going to Tomo when they had first opened.  Eventually weened ourselves away from the place because at the time it seemed that the service was not quite the same and we're real sticklers about that kind of thing.  Once we've had bad experience at a place usually don't go back.  Well we did decide to try Tomo again after the other place we found really began to suck and we are glad we did.\\n\\nService has been great and they seem to have a much larger selection to choose from.  Usually sit at the sushi bar, like to watch them making everything.  When you sit there you get this great little salad of lettuce, cucumber and julienned carrots with this flavorful dressing.  You also get a bowl of miso soup.  Then the rolls start coming and yum, yum, yum.\\n\\nIf you have room for dessert after getting your sushi fix on, you need to try one of the tempura ice creams.  It's a ball of ice cream, they have different flavors to choose from, coated with tempura batter, quickly deep fried, then presented on the plate quartered with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle.  What a way to spend the evening.\n"

aS"As of late part of my Saturday morning ritual has been to stop off at Home Depot. I have a decent sized back yard that was just screaming for a few upgrades. \\n\\nMy first trip I was in search of a gas grill. The associate that was helping me was super enthusiastic! She totally got in to the hunt for the perfect grill. She was also kind enough to help me carry my treasure trove to the return counter for checkout, since I was parked on that end of the lot. The customer service was excellent. \\n\\nFor the past several weekends I've needed odds and ends for the container garden I've begun. The potting soil, plants and pots are all very reasonably priced. Another win for me is that the three plants I bought at Home Depot (cucumber, Thai chili and habenero) are alive and flourishing. Anyone that has ever bought a plant from a big box retailer will understand how nice this is. \\n\\nSo, great customer service coupled with excellent and reasonably priced selection? See ya next Saturday, Home Depot!\n"

aS"Nello's is pretty darn wonderful - more than a strict sauce slicked pie joint in that some of their creations are pushing the culinary envelope.  I've actually Googled some of their specialty toppings at the table to figure out what they are, the cheeses so specific to regions around the world that you'll want to learn more on why they are notable.\\n\\nOriginal crust is thick and buttery, yielding heavy toppings and tender strands of mozzarella.  I'm a big fan of the Schriers pepperoni on a margherita pizza, laden with fresh garlic and torn basil.  Salads are hearty and plentiful, with a killer Spinach Salad (crisp bacon, egg, crunchy radishes and grape tomatoes) and White Balsamic Dressing.\\n\\nWaitstaff at this location are bustling while still managing to be endearing.  Service can get spotty on weekends when the place crowds a bit, but on two separate occasions where mistakes were made, the manager corrected both immediately with not only no charges for the items but still sending the ordered items.  We've actually left with two pizzas in hand - totally unasked for but very appreciated.\\n\\nI don't really compare the pizza here to other thin-crust pies - it's so specific of a taste, it's almost its own thing.  That all being said, it's such a yummy experience, if you don't pigeonhole the pizza, you are in for a treat.\n"

And I have to say I've seen the other side!! Amen, hallelujah!!

You name it, I've been able to grab it at Walt's and everyone is always sure where everything is when you aren't. It's almost like if you were to walk into a grocery store and hand someone your list and they walk you through in the most efficient way possible. It's that awesome. \\n\\nThrough Walt's I've learned that stud finders are in locked cabinets. I never would've known that :) Those studs... They're dangerous I tell you.\n"

aS"This is where I go when I crave falafel, and that craving is not infrequent. The falafel platter is generous and filling and can satisfy even this carnivore who's trying to be vegetarian but relapses way too often. Their kabob platter is equally good and the shawarma is OK but could be better. Their tasty lentil soup makes a great beginning to any meal here.  The guys running the place are friendly and the dining area itself is pretty generic. Location is good, although it shares the same problem with the rest of the establishments in the area: parking.\n"

aS"I LOVE French food.. in fact when we travel abroad, me and the Mr always make a point to visit a Frenchie place in another city. So when I got wind of a new French place right here in our own backyard I was stoked! The best part, its owned by chef James Porter, who did amazing job over at the now closed Tapino, so my excitement turned to elation when our reservation was confirmed!\\n\\nSo now that I'm home from my dinner with the Mr, I guess I'm slightly indifferent. While they had a strong opening night, it wasn't the service or food per-se but more like the other diners. \\n\\nThe dining room is small and extremely intimate with an amazing looking patio, we chose to sit on the inside. The interior is covered in wood, really, the floors, ceiling, walls but nicely contrasted by very stylish crystal chandeliers. I do have to say that I'm sure glad that they chose larger tables for the diners, since you can never have enough space. So there is plenty of room at the table to simply spread out and relax.\\n\\nService is pretty shiny and have no complaints, in fact our server was outgoing, attractive and knowledgeable. The bar staff was also very competent since both of our cocktails, Bohemian Sidecar ($9) and the Le Matador de Nimes ($9) were mixed perfectly and tasted great, putting us both into great moods until... a 6 top was sat down right next to us.. I know the old saying, you can't choose your family and in this case, you cant choose your dining neighbors either. They were so loud the Mr and I just looked at each other then decided to check email and stuff on our phones. We couldn't even talk which was a real bummer since this was going to be a romantic evening out. Anyway, the food will make up for it, right?\\n\\nOf course I have high expectations.. new Foodiebear rule of life, never have expectations of anyone, or anything or you're going to set yourself up for irritation, heartache and misery. With that being said they were out of f*cking Pate! Can you believe that?! Out of the one thing that Ive been looking forward to this entire week. Opening night, first thing on the menu, first table in the place, out of something. I know, I know, things happen but come on, this is opening night!!!! *Sigh* Ended up ordering the Steak Tartar ($8) and the Mr ordered the Foie Gras ($10). Both were excellent both in presentation, quality and taste. While my tartar wasn't pate, it was still excellent with its fried egg on top and crispy potato crisps. The foie was much like the tartar, deliciously perfect and for the price, major value. In fact all of the food that we ordered was really big, surprising for the price points. \\n\\nLet me tell you what, the Onion Soup ($6) was prefect. In fact Ive never had onion soup that was that good! Perfectly sweet, savory and the right amount of cheese crouton to compliment the soup, not over power it. The Mr liked his Vichyssoise ($6) with it smooth creamy texture and a quenelle of salmon mousse in the center which added a smokey complexity to the soup. Again, the servings were quite large and could have been halved pretty easily. \\n\\nEntrees were a kind of hit and miss. The Mr had the Steak Frites ($17) which was well cooked but came covered in compound butter thaqt had anchovy in it. First bite I was immediately turned off to the slight fishy undertone. Thank goodness neither of us have fish allergies, very unexpected. The frites were nicely crisp and well seasoned. However the side of sauce for dipping was just strange. Was made from vinegar and had a decent texture but just tasted odd with the fries and the meat all together. Would have preferred something a little more basic, again a preference. I ordered the Porc et Lardon ($16) as my entree and Im pretty happy with the result. Grilled bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with roasted pork gratin which was made with roast pork shoulder, shaved fennel and celery root. The contrast in the flavors and textures was right up my alley aside from the tenderloin being a tad over cooked, it is again opening night.\\n\\nDesserts were limited to three choices, Chocolate Brulee, Biegnets and Grande Marnier Souffle. We went with the Biegnets de Nutella ($6) and the Souffle ($6). The biegnets had a filling of Nutella which was alright but wasn't a fan until, I took some of the Mr's creme anglaise and dunked them into that. Delish. The souffle was so light and and was just brown enough to caramelize the sugar. You cant go wrong with either dessert. \\n\\nAll in all Petite Maison is an excellent value and with Chef James Porter at the helm expect solid French fare nightly with breakfast and lunch being added soon. Looking forward to back soon but this time Ill go with no expectations.\n"

aS"Great place for a hike! Like other Yelpers have mentioned, this location is not crowded at all. We actually parked at the park at the end of 18th Street on the south side of the mountain. The trail from there joins the Lookout Mountain trail that loops the mountain. The other parking lot South of Greenway on the north side of the mountain was also pretty empty so you wouldn't have a problem finding parking there either. We chose to do the hike to the top of the mountain which was great but gets really steep at some areas so be prepared. The good thing is it's a short distance to the top. I really enjoyed hiking here because it wasn't too easy and wasn't too difficult. I plan on including this location in my regular hiking schedule.\n"

aS'We love this place for breakfast, have not tried lunch items.  Multi-grain pancakes with caramel and banana are my faves, the kid likes the choc-chip ones and hubby gets the same bacon, cheese and mushroom omelette every time.  We all love the cheesy hash browns despite the coronary clogging side effects.  Another yelper mentioned the pancakes having too much cinnamon but I did not taste any cinnamon at all and I am not a fan of the popular spice so I would definitely notice an over kill.  The service is always friendly and accommodating, servers that laugh, talk, smile and deliver!  The place is clean, cool and brightly decorated. Not a full service place, you place your order at the counter yet the service does not end at the counter. The staff delivers your food, checks to see if you have everything you need and comes to clear your dishes.  They also frequently bus the beverage area keeping it clean and stocked.  Overall our experiences at Scramble have been excellent, it is now our go to place for breakfast.\n'

This took us by surprise, but at least we didn't have to stress about parking. \\n\\nThe hostesses were very nice and efficient. We waited for our party at the outside bar which was very comfortable. Once it was dark they projected a movie/TV onto the wall which was cool.\\n\\nThe interior was lovely! Industrial lights and red brick walls. Beautiful paintings and cool architecture. I found myself inspired by the decor. The tables were really close together, but it was okay.\\n\\nThe service was great. They were on top of the water refills, so we were never thirsty. There may or may not have been an incident where the bus boy dripped olive oil on our friends one year old. This was just a speculation because we didn't see it happen. In any case she cleaned up easily and there was no harm done. The waiter was good at clearing away our plates and making sure we were happy.\\n\\nGood food! The French onion burger was way too good. I suspect someone exchanged their soul for the recipe. I got the pork chile verde, which was good, but probably not the best thing on the menu. \\n\\nI can't wait to go back again. It will be a good date night with my husband.\n"

aS'First visit  last night. Very happy to see something great go into the Clarendon. Cool to see that little burst of red popping out the front with the glass hinting at people and activity inside. There will be more visits!\\n\\n\\nFOOD\\nDig the simple menu. More places should try this: find a few things to make very well, and execute on them. Keep it simple. Add more only as you can do so without lessening the consistency and quality of your core menu.\\n\\nSo far, only had the tacos. They were fresh-tasting, well-seasoned and overall, delicious. A little on the sweet side, but the balance was there. Only critique is to echo that maybe the little metal radiators, while effective at display and containment of tacos, might be dissipating the heat of the food too quickly. Some other more insular, less conductive material might be a better (more expensive?) approach.\\n\\nDefinitely trying the tortas with egg next time.\\n\\nDRINK\\nSmall, but interesting selection. Started with the Madre cocktail. Very fresh grapefruit/citrus flavor. No extra sweetener detected. Also, no vodka detected; but that could be my Irish liver or the power of fresh-squeezed juice. Next a glass of Lo Brujo - bright, minerally refreshing Spanish white. Enough citrus to balance out the mineral and the body.\\n\\nBoth beverages were excellent summer fare.\\n\\n\\nUpdates to follow :-D\n'

aS"Where Pinkie Danced.....\\n\\nIt's 10:30 P.M. on Friday, October 1.  We got an ice cream cone at Pink Spot, open  'til 10 P.M.  \\n\\nThose are important words in central Phoenix on Friday night.  Not only did we get ice cream, but I walked past people sitting out front at the cafe tables, sitting inside on the sofas, and sitting at the big table.  Friends, lovers, mates, maybe neighbors.  All talking, enjoying each other's company, the ambiance, and the treats.  A fine fall evening in central Phoenix.  The Pink Spot can't be mentioned without a word on it's tomato sauce and cheese slathered siamese twin, Z Pizza.  The Z was open, the lights bright, and if I wanted pizza, I could have some.  There's plenty of tables in the Z for overflow from the Pink.\\n\\nMost of central Phoenix shuts down after work, rolls up the sidewalks, driving home to Gilbert, Buckeye or Anthem.  It's a great thing to have a cozy, chatty evening spot with great ice cream and ice cream treats, and former Starbucks baristos steaming up all they bring to the coffee arts.  Pink Spot's a people magnet. \\n\\nDid I mention way-to-work breakfast meals, and again, coffee?  They open at 7 A.M.  Give yourself a little wait time and the Pink Spot will take care of your hunger and caffeine needs, sending you happily energized and your fast broken down the road of life.  \\n\\nPhoenix is trying to coax its central core into a more vibrant, attractive, alive-at-night city.   The Pink Spot is one of the places that's starting to happen.  About 9:50, the last trash bag hits the dumpster and by 10 you'll have to go somewhere else, like going home and Yelp*ing.  Maybe Pink Spot would consider staying open until 11 P.M. on Friday and Saturday nights - in the Fall, Winter and Spring.  Then  I might bring Sweet D by on a date.\n"

aS"I FINALLY made it here with some friends after months of wanting to try it out and it was worth the wait. This is a really cool place with a nice open feel, cozy and casual. There is also a nice bar. I was really impressed by everything that we had. They have a great deal after 8:00pm on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday that consists of a half-pitcher of wine and their noshing board for $25...GREAT value. We also had Brussels Sprouts and Chicken Meatballs both of which were great. The Chicken Meatballs are served with a spicy marinara that I swear has a touch of cumin that gives it a slight curry taste-DELICIOUS!!!\\nFor my entree I had what is probably the BEST Shepherd's Pie I've ever had. The beef was so perfectly prepared that it was tender and delicious while the tips of the beef were so slightly crisped it really was blissful and euphoric to consume it. I was also able to try the short rib which was equally tender and flavorful as well as a damn good pork chop (which was their special) considering that I am not a fan of pork. This pork chop was tasty and moist, not dry the way pork chops can be. Their Macaroni and Cheese is good with little bits of bacon.\\nFor dessert we had Death By Chocolate and Pumpkin Creme Brulee. the Creme Brulee tasted like silky pumpkin pie minus the crust. Death by Chocolate is a creamy chocolate pudding topped with whipped cream and a chocolate cookie.\\nHearty is probably the best way I can describe my meal here and the entire evening was enjoyable. The service was attentive and enthusiastic-maybe a little too enthusiastic as I felt like I had ADD when the entrees with their amazing local ingredients were being described to me. But considering how awful service can be in some places, it is refreshing to see servers who have such passion and pride in the food they are serving. \\nI highly recommend Beckett's Table for an outstanding meal, reasonable prices, good service and an overall great experience dinning out. I think I may go back next week.\n"

aS'"""Not a little bit country, not a little bit rock  and  roll (Donnie and Marie, hollah!), and well, not at all quite corporate, Hotel Indigo has a sleek, hip vibe all around while being very comfortable and accessible to those of us who don\'t necessarily like staying at a larger chain hotel (Hotel Indigo is, however, part of the IHG, Intercontinental Hotel Group). \\n\\nA major reason why I\'m so generous with my stars here is that the bathroom mirror makes you always look good. Can I get one in my house, please? I can\'t emphasis enough how your whole frame of mind changes when you look into a mirror and think, \\damn, my skin looks great!\\"""" whether that\'s at 3 in the morning or 7 in the evening (let\'s add on to that: wow, my eyes sparkle and do I detect a shimmer in my hair?) OK, so maybe there\'s some kind of hocus pocus going on in that mirror because I rarely, if ever give four stars to a hotel.\\n\\nRooms are well-appointed, the wood panel floors are nice and the bed, bedding and pillows made for a good night\'s sleep. It\'s also spacious enough, with a couch and coffee table area. \\n\\nI *loved* the outdoor patio that is off the bar. There\'s a fire going on out there, along with heating lamps. A real treat for those of us who hail from cities where cold winters are a source of our discontent. The bar itself is comfy and nice, only complaint being that the prices are that of what you\'d expect in a New York City bar (8 bucks for a Three Olives cocktail? 8-10 bucks for a glass of average wine?). Oh and that pool! It glows in different colors at night. There was a night when I sat on the patio (which overlooks it) and it was just a really cool effect. I think that the deck is a major draw to staying here. And because it\'s the desert, no effin\' mosquitoes, so you can sit out here all night if you want.\\n\\nStaff is accommodating and sweet, especially the gals who worked during the day in the bar/restaurant during the week and on Saturday. The bartenders during the week were really cool, too. Not sure why this bar closed at 11pm on a Thursday. Major bummer. I guess it\'s a slow time of year. I just wish they could be consistent, as the night before the bar closed at midnight (and when I asked the front desk how late the bar was open, I was told midnight). \\n\\nI\'m a big fan of rain showers and the water pressure was decent (until someone flushed a toilet). The hard water stains by the drain were kind of icky to have to look at...someone needs to go at the grout with a toothbrush. Also curious why they have those cards out that say they are a green hotel, but my towels were changed daily (I hung them up as directed). I can see changing out the washcloths but it\'s a bit excessive to change out the towels. Also worth noting that no hotel seems to practice what they preach on those cards.\\n\\nOne drawback to the hotel is that the gym is TINY. As in, two treadmills, two elliptical machines (one of which wasn\'t working) and one bike. The weight room, also tiny, has a good amount of free weights. I was thankful that Hotel Indigo didn\'t seem to have any other business travelers because working out in the early morning would have been impossible.\\n\\nI am also not such a fan of the dreary meeting room on the fifth floor, either. What\'s up with that? I kept looking up at the black ceiling with exposed vents with despair, although I was hardly in a desperate situation. Not to mention, there\'s a lack of any natural light and ugh, I can\'t see anyone wanting to spend time in there, even when surrounded by the most entertaining and coolest colleagues (the Yelp CMs, of course).\\n\\nBath products are by Aveda (Rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner. Tiny bars of soap, which I\'m not a fan of (shower gel, please!) and an unappealingly scented lotion. They are not generous with replenishing the products. This wouldn\'t be a big deal if this were not a hotel owned by the Intercontinental, but when the Westin and W replenish your products daily, you have to wonder why the Intercontinental is cutting corners in this way. If you\'re going to call something a \\""""boutique\\"""" hotel, then bring on the amenities. \\n\\nAs others mention, if you\'re sensitive to noise, you might not want to stay in this hotel (or in Scottsdale). The hotel kindly provides bedside ear plugs, however. \\n\\nNone of the above mentions are a deal breaker though, just worth noting. I\'m a fan of this hotel and look forward to staying here again in the future. \\n\\nThen again, this could be just the mirror talking..."""""""\n'

The pasta giovanni is absolutely freaking outstanding. Despite the large portion, every time I feel compelled to keep shoveling it down until the plate is clean. \\n\\nThe fried mozzarella appetizer is good too. I was expecting those stupid sticks that come as appetizers everywhere else. Instead, it was a nice, large piece of cheese that looked like it was covered with the batter from fish n' chips. \\n\\nI've yet to have the pizza, although walking by tables with it, it does look promising.

It looked like the Bates Motel (Psycho) and I couldn\'t even find the lobby; I wasn\'t sure if it was part of a store next door that sold saddles and wagon wheels (but it was locked up and closed).  I saw a sign on the ground with a hand painted on it and the finger pointing to the sidewalk.  It said \\Lobby.\\""""  I never found lobby.  That was my good luck because I gave up and asked a local if there were any other hotels around and he directed me to the Carefree Resort down the road about a mile or so away from bustling Cave Creek.  \\n\\nGot a room for $69 which was a great deal because the room was beautiful and had a big balcony with a view of gorgeous cacti.  The service was great except that housekeeping didn\'t clean the coffee pot; no big deal.  I\'m just glad they had a coffe pot!  \\n\\nThe pool was fantastic and the burger (poolside) was yummy.  The bellman gave me a free ride into Cave Creek where I had a rip-roaring good time at the Buffalo Chip nearby (with real live bullriding in the back!).

I'm not a lounge bar girl, but rather a dive bar girl.  Either way, as far as lounge bars go, Side Bar is basically it.  This is the kind of bar you bring a boy that you're dating who lives in Tempe to show him that there are cool bars in Central PHX.

Some of their own brews: the orange blossom and coco joe are some of the most delicious and unique beers I have ever tasted.  I recommend bringing growlers home.

aS"I am a sucker for James Beard Award places so this made my short-list this year for my trip.\\n\\nIt's in a cute heritage area just outside the mammoth convention centers and sport stadium, so parking is a bit of a pain.  Once you get inside, it's incredibly quaint.  There is a server/menu mismatch since I'm guessing there are not a lot of Asian people in the area.  So to hear the server (who looks like a student backpacker) describe an isakaya and items where there is some Chinese influence, it gave me a good laugh.\\n\\nThat being said, the food is excellent.  The portions are small so I'd recommend 3-4 dishes for 2 people.  We shared the curried lamb with mango (mmmm, so good!)  If there are any Vancouverites reading this, think Vij's lamb popsicles but marinaded in a different sauce.\\n\\nThe warm duck salad is excellent!  It's a neat twist to serve the salad warm and slightly seared and it paid off well.\\n\\nThe pork belly buns were delicious - I've never had these before!  They use the Chinese style steamed bun material but shape it into ovals that they fold in half and insert the pork belly filling.  Excellent!\\n\\nThe menu is small but very solid.  Service was OK and if this was more polished/authentic/better fitting to a higher-end Asian restaurant, I would bump this up to a 5.\n"

aS'"""Three flights up from The Big Bang basement bar, The Library street level bar, and on the roof of Hooters is the icing on the college bar cake stack. Once you step inside and begin to catch your breath (assuming you\'re a sad old fuck like me and get at all winded from scaling three flights of stairs), you\'ll feel instantly at home (if home to you feels like a moderately nightclubby rooftop college bar on Mill Ave.). \\n\\nThe inside is all black, but they spared us from the excessive black lights that illuminate your fabric softener making you feel like everyone can see your body is covered in dandruff. There\'s a big open dance floor that spans the length of the room along the bar leading to an outside patio. The walls are lined with a college version of swanky white comfy seating with curtains to make you feel like a VIP. \\n\\nWe were allowed to sit in a velvet roped off VIP area, but told that we would only have to move if someone \\bought it.\\"""" We were soon to find out how unlikely that would be...\\n\\nThe Dj arrived and started blasting hip hop (a personal un-favorite), and I asked him to turn it down in just the speaker that was aimed at us so we could hear each other. It took us awhile to realize that nobody was inside even though we had a clear view of the patio, but we finally did and we headed out. \\n\\nThe patio was quieter and it overlooked Mill Ave in all its glory. We could see from the treetops to the pedestrians across the street. The patio quickly filled up while the inside remained more or less empty. They were gracious enough to include an outside bar so we didn\'t have to endure hip hop music on 11. There were also beds outside and some decent bar-height seating near the balcony which made it pretty casual and relaxing and social. \\n\\nMy biggest problem with the outside was that everyone was smoking (as young people all apparently do) and it felt just as smoky as the insides of smoky bars used to be before the smoking ban. I also kinda felt kinda cheated by having to pay 2 bucks for a diet soda refill (no refills, son). The staff was pretty nice and the waitresses seemed to be very attentive and efficient (and cute). \\n\\nIt\'s not really my kind of place because of the music and the crowd and the fact that those days are behind me, but I imagine that it has to be the best thing on that corner.

Turns out I have passed this establishment a LOT since I go to SMoCA and Orange Table almost every week. But it was always during the day or late on a Tuesday, so I just saw older sophisticated couples lounging on the patio while riding my bike and figured \\""""Meh. Expensive steaks or some shit for rich people. Whiz-ev\\"""". \\n\\nHah...not quite.\\n\\nNo one was on the patio (does anyone else think it looks eerily like a cross b/w a Star Wars bar and a Flintstones cafeteria?) due to the rare rain, and the place was packed but I managed to get Melinda a seat at the bar. They had this gigantic drink menu and I was treated to an old lady drink-I think I got a gimlet. Hey-I can\'t do G and T ALL the time (just 98.8% of the time). It was pricey, but why didn\'t anyone tell me to bring my swimsuit? Cause I could have SWAM in that glass. Check it-that martini glass was as big as my FACE. It was terrifying to balance and I...of course, did end up spilling 20% on my jacket and outfit (clear drinks rule for that purpose) and smelling of eau de alkie. Glad I didn\'t drive! But then Melinda ended up spilling her drink on the nice ladies slick black jacket that I discretly dried off with cocktail napkins-hey, it was like vinyl, ok? Don\'t judge!\\n\\nGlancing around-there are some GAY hotties here. I mean, damn, can I be a gay man just so I can have an iota of a chance of hitting that? All the beautiful people were here-very LA, but not super Snottsdale either. Diverse crowd, well dressed, artsy, big groups of totally random people sitting together, nibbling at the food like doe on a field, grazers really. I started staring at one table in front of us that had the largest bowl of waffle fries. They were hardly eating them. My god. The longer I was there, the more I WANTED THEM. I started thinking \\""""Ok-there is a chick-ooo-shes gone-its a bunch of dudes-most of them straight..ok, they will TOTALLY give me a waffle fries..ok, will this make me look coked-up or homeless? Shit. I want one. I\'m gonna do it. Fuck it. Ohhhh...shes back. Girls never give food out to random girls. Oh well. Maybe if they leave...and I can grab it before the waiter does...while EVERYONE in the restaurant can see I just grabbed trash off the table in a chi-chi hipster spot...its worth it\\"""".\\n\\nI didn\'t. I chickened out. But seeing Kristin\'s review, I wasn\'t the only one who feels like a Sex and hte City Oliver Twist. \\""""Please, sire, one cosmo or waffle frie?\\""""\\n\\nWe thought about getting another drink there but remembered we had paid 15 bucks for a ticket for a reason (art..oh yeah...) Before heading out, we ended up chatting with our bar\'s neighbors (the one whose coat we soiled a wee bit).  Her and her new roommate received all this food, one that had like pizza with avocado slices and other delicious thing-my eyes were bugging OUT of my head-this food looks AMAZING. At one point I thought she was going to feed me aforementioned slice-and I wouldn\'t have cared. She noticed my lobster bling and freaked. I looked down, already a lil sloshed (these drinks are STRONG) and thought she was looking at my chest. \\""""Huh? They\'re real\\"""", I thought, not very impressive in the Scottsdale world of implants. She corrected me it was the bling, and I said, \\""""Oh good....my breasts aren\'t very impressive and I was wondering why you were checking them out.\\"""" \\""""Honey-you have FABULOUS tits.

I had the shrimp cerviche, which was an amazing deal at 9 bucks for a meal instead of an appetizer. Primo avocado, delish shrimp with the fresher salsa and delectible chips, I didn\'t offer it to share with my fellow dining companions. Since they had the BLT with avocado and bacon and the infamous waffle fries, I asked him to add a small plate with a side of mayo for me to devour with them. And man, they are GOOD-the guys ate their fries before their sandwich! And they only charged me a buck extra for the huge plate of waffle fries I couldn\'t even finish. Extra star!"""""""\n'

This is typically what I order when I go there for lunch on the weekends. Their lunch menu, which is available all the way to 5:00 PM, is a great deal. I usually get the two meat one (already mentioned which meats I prefer), with a side of slaw, green beans as a replacement for a corn cobette, and a corn muffin. Usually scaled down lunch portions are not as satisfying as their relative dinner portion. This lunch portion, however, is more than enough food to stuff your gord.\\n\\nWill I go back to Famous Dave's, specifically the one at San Tan? You're darn right I will again-and-again-and-again.\n"

We've been looking since moving here a few years back for a descent steak  and  I've had some good ones but none as good as here.  While it won't rival the prime cut steaks, it is quite close and at only $21 for a 12oz ribeye and a loaded potato, what a deal. My wife had the spiced chicken pasta bowl and I'd give it 4 stars too, though I thought a little more chicken and less pasta would of been the perfect touch.\\n\\nThe onion ring appetizer is very nice as is the ambiance  and  service.\\n\\nWhile its a 25 minute drive for me, I'd make the trip again and again.\n"

aS"Another place I love... and it's fat free, so I don't feel as guilty! :-)\\n\\nI find it very interesting and kinda funny to read about people complaining about prices. Mojo provides these mondo cups to fill, but that doesn't mean you have to fill it to the top. I suppose if I was planning on taking a pint home, I might be a lil' grumpy at having to pay 10 bucks. Then again, any ice cream/yogurt parlor you go to will charge you more than the grocery store...\\n\\nAnyways, moving on... so, I love how the set-up allows you to sample the yogurt and put on your own toppings. I normally get a couple of different flavors and mix them together. My friends and I all agreed that the pricing was pretty fair. Usually I spend around $2.50, maybe $3 at the most. The yogurt is always pretty fresh too. Good thing they don't have one by my house...\n"

The hubby had the mahi mahi which was good, but could have used more sauce. Our friends split the yellow curry which was some of the best I've had in town.  Great heat and flavor.  Bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated.  The whole place had a positive vibe and friendly (though not the most prompt) service.  Will go back again for sure!\n"

aS"I LOVE this bar. My first visit was in 2004 when it was known as Bar Nun. I'd just moved to AZ and I was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name. Little did I know it was the beginning of a love affair. \\n\\nSince I didn't know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar. The staff was friendly and so were the patrons. Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly, and the bartender, Jennifer, insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety. As if that wasn't enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome!\\n\\nThe burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like. I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich. And the wings. They'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus. In fact I don't thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here.\\n\\nThursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band. Usually classic rock or 80s stuff. They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you're into sports.\\n\\nI was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance. Not that you'd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldn't want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they'll pick you up and drop you off. That way you don't have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City.\\n\\nWow, I kinda wanna move back now. CK's I miss you!!!\n"

The bartender Jeff is truly outstanding - incredibly friendly, knowledgeable about the wines and cheeses (but not in a snobby way), and a good conversationalist (never a \\how\'s the weather today?\\"""").  On more than one occasion he\'s slipped me a couple complimentary wine/cheese tastings.  \\n\\nI like the James Bond they generally have projected onto one of the walls with the sound off.

They also have a small lcd tv above the bar that they\'ll put anything on, from the Food Network to Dancing With The Stars to the DBacks game - whatever you\'re into that night.\\n\\nThe sit-down wine tastings are fun and interesting (and not that expensive) and each showcases a different specific wine making region (or a specific vineyard).  You will likely be introduced to one or more delicious and inexpensive wines you never would have otherwise known about, and they give you the opportunity at the end of the tasting to purchase the bottles at a reduced price.\\n\\nThe only downside is that I\'ve gained 10lbs eating cheese and drinking wine."""""""\n'

I\'m not gonna lie: the petroglyphs are awesome. There are about 1500 images scattered across the rocky hill, and it seems like they are all facing the same side. It appears that the hill and the the rocks were very important to the people who carved these images and many present day tribes claim symbolism that pertains to their culture is found on the rocks, so maybe it was important for more than one group. My guess is the location was important because it was related to some ancient volcanic activity; that is how basalt is formed. \\n\\nAnyway, totally rad reserve and museum and clearly i\'m a huge geek. the end."""""""\n'

aS"UPDATE:  I hate to take away a star, but they've since lost a star in my book due to inconsistancy with offerings.  What they consider their best sellers and best desserts they don't even carry all the time.  Boo.\\n\\nIt's rare to find a patisserie that I can rave about, especially because I do a lot of my own desserts at home.\\n\\nWhat I look for in a good dessert:\\n\\nIf it's a rich dessert, it should be thick and moist or indulgently creamy.  Eating a rich dessert should make you feel sexy and naughty, like stealing a peek at a hot guy across the way to find he's looking at you too.\\n\\nIf it's a light dessert, it should be just sweet enough to invite you in bite after bite.  It shouldn't make you feel guilty, but it should satisfy a sweet tooth at the same time.\\n\\nArai has both for the taking.\\n\\nConveniently next to Fujiya, a cute little Japanese market, this bakery has a small selection of desserts, but what they do create, they do well.\\n\\nThe Green Tea Mousse is to die for, resuscitate, and die for again!  The light pillowy mousse has just enough hint of green tea to let you know what you're eating, and isn't so sweet you feel like you just invested in grills made out of sugar crystals.  \\n\\nIt's pretty much the only thing I order there, although I've tried the fruit tart as well (delish too!) and I've heard the blueberry mousse is great, but they seem to run out when I get out there.  On top of the desserts, they offer fresh breads and cakes to order.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly, which is always a plus.\\n\\nI can't wait to get back there to try their other offerings!\n"

While I can't be sure of this, his frequent and lengthy absences had me suspicious that he was, in fact, cooking our meals. \\n\\nThat being said, the food was excellent. Eggs Benedict is the bellwether of all brunch meals for me, so that's what I ordered. The latte that I ordered was exceptional. At $5 a pop, I easily could have run up a $30+ bar tab on these alone. To keep costs under control, I made the switch to regular coffee, which was also excellent. \\n\\nAll in all, a great meal. My only disappointments were the lack of crowds and spotty service.

aS'Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.\n'

They were so succlent, I wanted to cry. I had a chance to talk with their head chef and complimented them on all the great food, the asparagus was devine as was the chorizo and potato dish! My favorite for the night! I guessed how it was made and wasn't told a THING! DAMNIT! (grrr!) I fell in love with the Spanish tortilla which is more like a frittata or really thick omlette. \\n\\nEvery dish was spot on and made me want to cry... or was that the entire pitcher of sangria again? I unno, but it was incredible and the back patio was amazing! Perfect for parties and out door dining. I would recommend this for anyone willing to travel to it's far north location.\\n\\nTo my yelpers: if this is far for you, like it's far for me... I still say GO! Give sitting indoors a try and tell me how it goes. Order the baby back ribs and chorizo potatos and be ready to beg the chef for the secret recipe like I did! Try the sangria, but don't drink the entire pitcher like I did... I wound up talking about Dominatrix Dungens in an Applebee's parking lot that night!! Not a pretty sight! :(\n"

aS"I had mini date night and we decided to come here on a whim. I mean it is close to my house so why not. Plus they have reverse happy hour and their boneless wings were on special in which they were half off all month with any drink purchase. Score. My friend decided that he wanted to try the Eclipse Burger challenge in which included 3 half pound angus patties, topped with 4 strips of bacon, cheddar and swiss cheese with crispy onions and a side of fries. If he finished it, he got a t-shirt and his picture placed on the wall. Well he finished it with no problem. He doesn't eat like that all the time and he said that he was full but not overly stuffed. Kudos to him. It looked amazing and I so wanted a bite, but alas he had to finish it all himself. Hmm maybe next time I will try. LOL ( NOT!)\n"

aS"So a group of us decided to get brunch here this am and boy am I glad I did. I started with a super killer spicy bloody Mary that came with a little beer chaser...awesome. I got the green Chile meat loaf with fried eggs. I can easily say this was among  the best meat loaf I've ever had .the texture was perfect, flavor deep and rich and it worked sooooo well with my over easy eggs. I can't wait to gio back and try some of the other stuff on the menu....awesome!!!!\n"

aS'I read about Los Reyes on Yelp earlier this year and have really wanted to try it. My boyfriend and I went on Friday and we REALLY enjoyed it! I used to be obsessed with tortas when I lived down in Guadalajara, so I was especially excited. I ordered a torta with chopped steak, onions, peppers, cheese, beans, avocado and more. Delicious! I could only eat half (half is about the size of a burger). I also got an horchata - really refreshing after the spicy-ness of the peppers and hot sauce. \\n\\nMy boyfriend got a steak torta and a Mandarin Soda. He LOVED it. He somehow managed to eat the whole thing! \\n\\nDefinitely want to go back and try more of their food and fresh juices. Highly recommend Los Reyes!!!\n'
