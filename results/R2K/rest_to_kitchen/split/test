S"I went to Daphne's today since I love their patio and wanted to leisurely dine outdoors. I ordered the Chicken Ka-bob and the double greek salad and a soft drink for $7.94 today. I love greek salad, but this came nowhere near to my expectations. I am used to a ton of tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, etc. I had two small tomatoes and cucumber slices and two or three olives and a lot of lettuce. I'm used to a greek salad having little if any lettuce. I guess I am spoiled by all the great greek restaurants in Chicago. Time to get busy and find a go to Greek Restaurant in this area.\n"

aS"Our first time here, after driving half an hour to try the place out. A mish mash of Asian dishes, some of which are hit and miss. We had the lettuce wraps appetizer, teriyaki chicken and Korean sizzling short ribs. The taste and sauces on all three were pretty good. The chicken was tender. But there was too little meat in the filling for the wraps - it was mostly just water chestnut. The ribs were not sizzling but lukewarm and were also the toughest I've ever had. Could not even eat half of the dish. The Chef or manager (he didn't introduce himself) made a lot of excuses when he came over to address the problem, like 'people' around here want their meat well done. Well done and overcooked are two different things. Service was below par, with only one waiter trying to keep up with dine in and take out customers. Won't be coming back here again.\n"

aS"My husband and I really wanted to check out this office because it is the closest to us. We had no problem making the appointment for doctor interview at 7:30 a.m., to meet the doctor and promptly showed up at the time of the appointment just to find out that the doctor was not there. In a brief conversation where we stated that we are going to wait until doctor shows up, we were told that we can't meet with doctor regardless of the appointment. Before we could even react office manager Marry Summers informed us that we cannot talked with other doctors, and what we were told is not true. I have to emphasize that Mary Summers was not nice, apologetic, and empathetic about our situation at all. She just wanted us out of the office. I know that everybody has a bad morning, but she was letting it shine. \\nMary continued with this; You were informed wrong, and what I am telling you is how it is; You don't need anybody's name but mine; Other people choose the doctor by reading the bio online; This is my office policy.......on and on and on Mary continued to cut us, and see us on the way out.\\n \\nMaybe those doctors in the office are nice, but why would I bother going through this office representation when even the doctor were not there for their appointment, and I would not see them even if I would wait.....\\n\\nTo all of you that still wish to try this office, I really wish you good luck.\n"

aS'This place sucks! The owner waited on us and her frizzy nasty hair was hanging down and all over the place. I guess because she had a hat on it was ok YUCK beside that she is a terrible waitress and this is the second time she has waited on us. The prime rib was the absolute worst we have ever had, the mac and cheese was pasta with milk no flavor at all. The owners kid runs around, screams and acts like a heathen and they think its cute and thats what paying customers want to experience when they go in there. We wont be spending anymore money in that place.\n'

aS"Why oh why is this joint always out of ham and cheese crossaints...prepare people!!!  I really don't think theres anything special about their sandwiches, I've tried a couple of them.  The soup is usually good, the salads are o.k but the cookies are pretty good.  Service is null, I actually caught a couple of the young guys who were making the sandwiches joking about one of the guests (rude).  I never order coffee here anymore because they always find a way of screwing it up.  So why do I keep stopping in here....it must be the cookies.\n"

aS'"""I really doubt Down Under will welcome my review, but I HAVE to do it just to get this off my chest. \\n\\nI spent a very long and frustrating hour+ this morning on the patio with my dog and some friends. My dog, Peekaboo seemed to enjoy it, but I HATED it! \\n\\nThere was a \\Doggie Day Sunday brunch on the patio\\"""" event going on on. I had scheduled a FindMyDogADate AZ Meetup there for this doggie event. All of the tables and chairs were taken when I arrived by the people running their doggie event tables. Eventually I found a table with two wet chairs directly under the very wet misters. (It\'s no wonder no one wanted to sit there). Since I had four other people coming, I scrounged up more chairs. All of them were directly under the dripping misters.\\n\\nAfter my friends arrived, I went inside to grab some brunch. They were charging a ridiculous $12 for rubbery whatever that was, cold eggs, rock hard pancakes and a tiny dish of grapes served by a lady who couldn\'t even tell me the price of the brunch. The orange juice was extra so I asked for a glass of water. I got a plate full of yuck, sat down in the wet chair while the water dripped on my plate of yuck making it even yuckier. I took my uneaten plate back after one bite and told them I would go eat at McDonald\'s. YUCK!!\\n\\nThe patio needs to be condemned! I was tempted to call the health inspector! Dogs had pooped on the gravel behind the tables and it wasn\'t cleaned up. No doggie poop bags were to be found anywhere. Luckily I had brought some with me. After cleaning it up, there weren\'t any trash cans available to dispose of it!!! \\n\\nThe \\""""waitress\\"""" never stopped by our table the entire time!\\n\\nAll on all it was a very dirty and disappointing experience.

aS"Cheuvront: oh so disappointing.  I have been to Cheuvront for dinner  twice, both times I walked away disappointed.  I've tried the many dishes including the duck, the chicken, and some appetizers.  My biggest complaint is that the food isn't that great.  It is 3 star food with 5 star prices.  The portions are small (like a tapas bar), which usually doesn't bother me as long as the food is amazing.  But this is not the case with Cheuvront.  I've tried many dishes here that are bland, with no depth of flavor.  There is no beer on tap and service takes a long time.  It's so close to where I live, that I really wanted it to be a neighborhood spot, but the utter lack of value and quality prevents it from doing so.  Either drop prices by 30% or make your food twice as good.\n"

aS"Disappointing to say the least....\\nThis is my 4th time here and I wouldn;t have gone here so many times if it wasn't the proximity to MCC. Each and everytime I have been rather dissapointed with teh level of service which has been slow and blase at the best of times.\\n This time around I had to wait 20 miniutes at teh sushi bar (after my order) before teh chef showed up. By then I had lost interest in suchi and Saketini as a whole. I would understand if this place was crowded but there were only 2 other groups and that too none of them were at the bar.\\n\\nNote to self: Never venture here again\n"

aS'to start with i went with my boyfriend at 330 on 9/10/11. there were only 5 tables of people there including us. after sitting down i realized the cushion was covered in chip crumbs and lettuce, clearly they had not been wiped off. after ordering the server Joe D didnt ask if i needed a straw or lemon for my water. then my boyfriend had to wait 10 minutes to get a refill on his pepsi. when i looked around i saw Joe D standing at the bar slurping from his drink while talking to the guy behind the bar. The table next to me were served burnt chips. when we got the food my chicken was dry. this place sucks! i had been there before about 10 years ago and it was great back then. lastly this company has no comment cards anywhere in the restaurant nor do they have a way to contact the restaurant or make complaints through the website. they must not care about their customers as much as they use to. i do not recommend. if you are looking for mexican there are better places in the central/biltmore area. the only good thing was the red sauce on the chimi but not enough to get me back.\n'

aS"Went for lunch recently because Verde was overflowing. Cool place- liked the atmosphere and there's a lot of room. Saw a DJ set up in the corner- I bet that's for their late night service which I would be willing to check out. As far as food, there is a small selection and it's all about $9/10 a plate. Asked for a vegetable substitution but the chef refused (in a way I can respect that he protects his food, but I might have liked it better if he had just obliged me). Service was friendly, but slow. I'm not saying Sens is bad- just that I've had better.\n"

aS'"""Mill Ave was packed with local stores and had a quirky, fun college town feeling in the 1970s when we moved here. Locals (my family included) went there all the time. Then our city fathers decided to \\improve\\"""" Mill Ave by \\""""yuppifying\\"""" it and chasing out local business and pursuing national chains. The death knell was when they built Tempe Marketplace. \\nFYI--parking spots are metered and parking is very tight.

aS'"""The first time I went there was a great experience. It was the first place I ever ordered a dirty martini, and it was delicious. The prices were a little higher than other places, but not too bad. I think I paid around $7 for a pretty strong martini\\n.\\nThe 2nd time, however, made me decide I will never return. I know it\'s a \\tequila bar\\"""", but I\'m not a fan of tequila. So I ordered a martini again. First, the bartender rolled her eyes at me. She started the drink with their \\""""well\\"""" vodka but, when that bottle emptied, switched to Skyy. After she hands me the drink and prints out the receipt for me to sign, she tells me they didn\'t have very much olive juice. I figured it would be fine, the dry vermouth should cut the flavor of the vodka enough. Then I noticed she charged me the price it would be for a skyy martini...I paid $10 for what basically turned out to be a glass of vodka with a couple olives in it. If I want straight vodka, I\'ll order it.\\n\\nI ended up going to another bartender and asking her to put a mixer in it, which she did with no problem.\\n\\nIn all of this, my friend had to wait 15 minutes before getting a drink (he was standing right at the bar). My boyfriend had to wait 20, and I even went and stood near him, leaning over the bar showing off cleavage, thinking maybe that would get me service quicker so I could just order his drink for him. Nope, still nothing. \\n\\nTried waving over bartenders multiple times, but they just kept going over to large groups of people who got there after us. We finally gave up on his drink.\\n\\nOn top of all of that, the boys had to pay a cover, which that place really shouldn\'t charge. I like Suite 301 far better, and I\'ve never paid a cover there.\\n\\nMaybe that was just a one-time thing, maybe we just had a couple bad bartenders, who knows. But I didn\'t think they were anything special, even when I did have a good experience, so I see no point in returning, nor will I recommend it."""""""\n'

aS"I'm probably a little biased in this review because of the fact that I can't stand disorganized stores. There are about 5 long aisles of merchandise in the store and it is almost completely random of what you will find (and where you will find it). From my understanding, unknown items come in each week with very good deals. The catch is that you have to be willing to maneuver your way through the mess to get to them... almost like a second-hand store. Not my thing. \\n\\nI'm willing to pay a few more dollars for an item to go into a store and find it located neatly in its place; a place that I know where it is; a place that I know I will find it. (i.e. you need sheets? You know that you can go to target and they're going to have a good selection of brands, styles, and colors... and you know what section of the store you'll find them in... and they're sorted on the shelves in an order that you can quickly find the size you need).\n"

aS'Wow... Another Casualty of our Times\\n\\nI was just at the cool clothing store Status on New Years eve to buy Hubby a cute couple of things that he might like to wear that evening to our New Years Dinner.  One Rock and Republic pair of jeans and 2 awesome rocker-type button up shirts.  He wore the shirt out to dinner but the pants were a little too tight.\\n\\nWent there yesterday to see if we could exchange them for him - and like a thief in the night, the Status clothing store was gone.  The only thing that would tell you it was there was the awning.  \\n\\nWhat irks me more is that I was there only 8 days ago and spoke to the general manager guy about his selection of clothing.  He did not ever mention they were going out of business or moving - and he knew I was buying this for my husband.  I would probably not have bought the jeans for him had i known I couldnt exchange them.\\n\\nThe rest of City North is just depressing as well.  Ocean Club is still anchoring it.  Food there is good but really more expensive than necessary.  \\n\\nA real shame about CityNorth.  I thought it was going to be great...\n'

aS"I went there the other night for dinner.  Granted, I was there early but other than two people sitting talking in the restaurant, there was nobody there.   I ordered a Chicken Arepa, Shredded Beef Empanada, and the Ground Beef Pastelito.   The kid who took my order behind the counter said it would take 15 to 20 minutes.  I couldn't figure out why it would take so long-maybe they had a lot of take out orders for pizza (they share the same kitchen with Rosati's).  Instead of taking 15 to 20 minutes, I'm waiting there around 30 minutes, the kid has disappeared, and once in awhile, I see some other guys in the back.  They must know I am waiting, but not once does anyone come out and tell me that my order will be out shortly.  Finally, some other guy who looks like he could be the boss asks me what I ordered.  I tell him, and he brings out my bag, which seemed to have been sitting there for who knows how long.  It seemed hot so I left and did not complain.\\n\\nAs far as the food, never having had an Arepa before, I was not too impressed.  It was somewhat bland and it tasted like a taco.  The empanada was incredibly greasy.  The Pastelito was the best-the ground beef was tasty.\\n\\nI might go back and try some other items on their menu but they need to improve on their customer service especially when there is virtually no one in their restaurant.\n"

aS"it has been over a year since I visited this hole of a restaurant, but my experience is what counts. The staff was confused and slow to visit our table, the pizza might be the most boring bland pizza I have ever had. The soda didn't taste right and the place was a total mess. To top it off the price was a bit high for something that can't even compete with Peter Piper. I would not go back to Grimaldi's if someone gave me a gift card. Try Prima Pizza sometime ... behind the Taco Bell on Val Vista and Baseline. It is a dive, but the pizza is simply amazing.\n"

aS'"""Such a waste. Great little cozy Mexican restaurant for a business lunch that somehow forgot 1) how to make Mexican food and 2) how to cater to larger groups on their lunch break.\\n\\nYou will fall in love with its quaint, wooden interior and carafes of salsa, but the love affair will start to wain once you realize how shoddy and unorganized the service is. It\'s one of those serve tables by committee places where no one will claim responsibility of any table that\'s out there. As such, you will go through long stretches without key elements for eating your meal and either be ignored or treated rudely when you ask for help.\\n\\nBut the real deal-breaker for me in my one (and probably final) trip here was the food. I got a \\Carne Asada Taco\\"""" platter, which turned out to be a loose definition for what I got. There was a stack of four tiny, over-saturated tortillas with some carne asada on it. No guacamole, no pico, or anything else. Just some carne asada and lettuce on sticky, wet tortillas. Also came with almost tasteless beans and rice on the side.\\n\\nThe carne asada itself was really good and some members of my party had slightly better entrees, including the ones who got carne asada burritos which were loaded with guac and such, but we all agreed it wasn\'t worth the price compared to a trip to Tradiciones, La Tolteca, or even Canasta.\\n\\nThen we got presented with a bill that included an auto-gratuity of almost 30%. We brought it up to the woman who was running the joint for the most part and took our orders and told her to sort that out. She apologizied and said, \\""""Oh, she can put on whatever gratuity she wants.\\"""" \\n\\nSay what? Who is \\""""she\\""""? You are the only one running the register and taking orders. And how can any server just come up with a gratuity of 30%? Needless to say this place is trying to shakedown large business parties and should be avoided as much as possible."""""""\n'

Lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pepperoncini tossed in balsamic vinegar, oh my, and then piled onto a fresh roll with ham and salami with mayo and mustard.  Not too bad, I must say.  It is, however, too bad the salami was a cheaper kind and not a dry Italian salami.  It kind of made the sandwich a little salty, but doo-able none the less.\\n\\nI ordered the pasta salad as a side.  I wont make that mistake again.  It\'s my understanding that pasta salad will be on the acidic side, usually involving vinegar of some kind.  This pasta salad was not acidic at all.  it included cabbage, carrots, sun-flower seeds and a taste that I still cant place.  It looked like it was a \\bus-tub\\"""" salad.  I took two bites and gave up, no sense in wasting calories.\\n\\nOverall, I think this place has potential, but my experience was nothing to write home about, sorry mom.\\n\\nFortunately for the rest of you . . . .

It\'s a \\Mexican Restaurant\\"""", so when I was there I tried a few of their tacos that were on happy hour. I\'m giving two stars because the duck taco that I had was pretty good, but once the food got to the table it took me 4 minutes to figure out which tacos were mine because of the way they present the food. More on this later. \\n\\nEl Hefe has a cool in-table tap system, where you pay at the table and can pour your own beer. When I saw this I liked it a lot, though they only offer two beers, and it\'s not cheap. After the \\""""cool\\"""" factor wears off, you realize that you\'re paying extra to pour your own beer. Not so cool. The upside is the fact that I get beers for myself much faster than the servers at El Hefe did for me. \\n\\nThe booth seats are covered in plastic, in the style of your great grandmother. This is assuming, of course, that your great grandmother commissioned Ed Hardy to design her living room group. The ambiance isn\'t my style, but I\'m sure that a lot of people love it...The biggest issue I had is the way the food is brought to the table. They start you with chips and salsa. It seems hard to screw up chips and salsa, but it happened here. The salsa comes in small jars that are downright weird, and they make dipping your chip absolutely impossible. You need to be a salsa MacGyver to figure out how to get the right amount of salsa on your chip...It\'s strange. After pushing some salsa around with a chip on a small plate for a while, our food arrived. Apparently, when you order tacos, they come 5-6 at a time, placed on wooden slabs that are roughly the size of a Las Vegas buffet. Our server couldn\'t remember who\'s tacos were who\'s, so we played a game of musical tacos (and wooden slabs) until we all figured out what we\'d ordered. When a group of 4-5 orders 10+ tacos, you end up with 2-3 giant wooden slabs on your table and a very confusing family style presentation. \\n\\nLike I said before, the duck taco I had was pretty good, and I hear good things about the BeerRita.

If you're looking to pick up a pie or grab some dessert, this spot can be a good option.\\n\\nAs far as dining here for lunch or dinner, it's nuthin special. American cuisine with no real surprises. They have an ok salad bar  and  can have some good soups (cheesy potato!) on hand, depending on what they made that particular day.\\n\\nThey have just about zero vegetarian entree options on the menu. If you're a veg head dragged along to this place for a meal, you'll probably have to custom order some pasta with veggies or get creative in another manner. I'll be trying my best to avoid the place for meals, but meat-eaters might find something enjoyable...\n"

But the Vietnamese part of the menu disappoints with a sampling of various appetizers providing frozen food aisle quality. There's definitely something fun in a place like this. If the menu aspired to compete at a level closer to food found at various Vietnamese restaurants in Chandler, there would be more temptation to eat here. But from a dining perspective, fusion/confusion may be the takeaway.\n"

Sadly, you cannot request a hairdresser (as I was rudely told) \\n\\nNext I got a disinterested girl who seemed like she was trying to get me over with asap (even though it was mid-morning and the place was empty). she didn't smile once and didn't say anything.

aS"Gross! I got a combo platter of chicken curry. On the menu it had a red pepper next to it, meaning to signify that it was spicy, but the curry was extremely bland, and it looked like greasy water. I assume that it is because they have such a thin curry that the dish was served in a cup-shaped fried egg roll wrapper. Not only was the sauce a disappointment, but the chicken was extremely fatty. \\n\\nThe fact that it was a combo platter meant that I also received side dishes... First of all, their fried rice has no egg or veggies in it, so it's just soy sauce-soaked salty rice. The egg roll was okay, although it was the heaviest egg roll I've ever encountered, since it was primarily fried wrapper around meager contents. There was also a side of horribly MSG-laden lo-mein. Finally there were two buffalo wings which I never got to because by that point I was not really wanting to eat any more of their food offerings.\\n\\nFirst bad meal out I've had in a long time (food-wise, anyway... at least the staff was pleasant). Maybe they have other foods that they are better at making? I don't know, and won't be back to find out!\n"

It can get crowded, but hey, it's an airport.  Get used to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerminal 2 however, 'home' to Continental and United Express flights, is the most abysmal place I've seen in a long time.  The 'security' guard I had to pass in order to get to the metal detectors was more interested in her split ends than in looking at my photo ID or checking that it actually matched the name on the ticket.  The Express flight gates are all housed in a small separate building that one must walk through an outdoor area in order to reach.  The entire terminal smells vaguely of mildew and disuse.  And all but one of the eating establishments is either boarded up or roped off and the place that is open...ewww.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI ordered a pastrami and swiss from the less-than-friendly counter person and after discussing the appropriate change I should have received back for my $20 bill, I traveled down the smeared glass to pick up my to-go sandwich.  Which had morphed into ham.  I didn't order ham. Well the ticket says sandwich special and that's ham.  Excuse me, but your board says 'special Pastrami and Swiss or Ham and Swiss' and I did not order ham - I don't EAT ham.  Sandwich maker goes down the line to have discussion with counter-person.  I wait.  Impatiently.  I am exceedingly hungry as well as minorly hung-over and I just want my * and $%(#$ and   food.

In fact it was so gelatinous, after a few minutes it actually acquired the semi-solid jiggle of actual Jello. \\nIt should be called corn starch chicken, not black bean chicken.\\n\\nThe service was uncomfortable and odd.  It was a farily dead Sunday afternoon,  yet the bartender dropped and broke three items at 3 different times while we were there.\\n\\nSomeone, a manager looking guy, was yelling from the kitchen to the bar (all the tables are located in between there) asking who had his Sharpie.\\n \\nMy daughter asked if she could substitute plain noodles for rice with her kids meal and the waiter just said \\No.\\""""   Then later he mumbled some comment about \\""""everything being pre-portioned\\""""\\n\\nPre-portioned?

aS"In an effort to start on a positive note, I will say that this place has a nice atmosphere. It's a very open space and I could see myself enjoying a beer on the patio during happy hour...if only the happy hour prices were desirable enough to prompt a return visit.\\n\\nThis is not a place you want to visit with intent to enjoy Vietnamese food as it is overpriced and for lack of better words...gross. The roll we ordered for an appetizer was okay, but the serving size was shameful considering the price, and the peanut sauce I requested on the side was very watery. Pho was the man dish, and it wasn't any better. In fact, it was worse. And with fake meat and funky flavor, it was left unfinished.\\n\\nIt makes me sad to think that someone may have their first Vietnamese dining experience here and potentially never eat it again as a result. I hope the owners consider sprucing up their recipes, or if nothing else dropping the 2nd half of their name, so that patrons visiting with the intent to dine on Vietnamese Cuisine won't be left disappointed.\n"

They were first argumentative and said I should have purchased an upgraded wash if I really wanted a better job than what I got. They said they would redo it giving me a premium wash for no additional cost. I didn't get to excited about the upgrade since this was a 2010 Mercedes and still looked like new on the inside. All I wanted  was a clean exterior. Imagine the horror of getting to the pick up area and finding that they put amorall or a like kind of  dressing all over the dash, speaker grills, vents and door hardware. When I went back to the entry area for now the third time they insisted that they gave me this special treatment as part of their premium wash. I insisted that they remove it and they sent another guy in with a scubbing pad and some unknown solution.  When finished I had a blotchy colored dash with shiny looking areas all over the hard to get to areas. When I talked to the guy that said he was the manager he said he would check with his supplier the following week and see if he could get something to clean up the mess. He said he would call back a week ago. Still no call and a $50,000 car that looks like crap thanks to these people. It's too bad they don't  have a minus five selection here. This is a good place to send anybody that you really dislike.\n"

A long time ago, I used to love their frog legs, but now they are so bad I cant even tell you. The abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs. I was so disappointed!\\n\\nThey raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes  and  sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.\\n\\nAlso, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order.\\n\\nThe food is inconsistent.  It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse  and  worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken!

I loved the decor and always thought that every restaurant should serve spumoni upon completion of a meal, but the romance has since ended now that I am an adult. \\n\\nIn the past year I have found myself here often as a central meeting place that could accommodate a large group. In both of those occasions we had the save server who lacked any ounce of charm in his body and felt way too comfortable with the fact that his gratuity was added into our bill due to size. He was brash and acted annoyed the entire time and despite our size we were pretty low maintenance. \\n\\nOther than service, the food is doing little to impress me. It has become one of those places where I am never truly satisfied with what I ordered. Because their menu is traditional fare I find myself comparing it to every other Italian place I have been and none of their dishes stand out as the best I have had or even close to it. The portions do not match the price in my opinion and neither does the quality. I just end up walking away from dinner feeling a bit cheated by the entire experience.

Unfortunately after waiting 1 hour for our initial consultation, Donna had to end our session after 35 minutes due to another appointment.          \\n\\nI\'m confident that the 6 CNM\'s at BHH would provide quality midwife services, as they seem experienced and reviews show them to be caring  and  understanding of a woman\'s desires during pregnancy and childbirth.

aS"Rarely will I write a negative review but my experience tonight at Fresh Mint makes it necessary. I have dined here three times prior, all during relatively quiet hours. Tonight, when dining with my family, the restaurant was slammed. I understand that they are a small, family-run joint, but something's gotta give!  My gripe is not with the food but with the service and the owner's poor attitude. During previous visits, he has been able to run the dining room on his own, but tonight he was completely in the weeds. \\n\\nTo start, they were out of their imperial rolls, which I really enjoy. The owner was apologetic but was also completely harried by his other tables and could barely finish a sentence without being called to another set of patrons. We had a last minute addition to our table when another family member called to say he'd be joining us. We placed orders for appetizers and soup until he was able to make it to the restaurant, but the owner seemed annoyed with our table anyway. \\n\\nThere was also a large party in the dining room from what seemed to be a radio show that advertises for this restaurant (one of the hosts interrupted our meal to give us a flyer about it) and those patrons were loud and after finishing their meals, hovered other tables to chit-chat. It was quite distracting. \\n\\nThe restaurant itself is tremendously loud and they play upbeat music from the 50's and 60's. This soundtrack would be fine during a lunch rush but not when people are trying to enjoy a quiet dinner with their families. \\n\\nAs for the food, it's adequate. A-OK, even. But the prices are outlandish and the service is unpleasant. We will not be returning as there are many fine, veg-friendly establishments in the city deserving of our business.\n"

This is my first time to Tuscany so was looking forward to great service, great food and a relaxing experience.  What we got when we arrived was an Italian bistro that was filled with families wearing shorts and t-shirts, rushed service and decent food.  Apparently, changes have taken place and the restaurant has decided to sacrifice its four diamond status to cater to the family clientele in shorts.  \\n\\nWhen we arrived the walk down the staircase to the restaurant was promising.  However, once we got to the host stand there was confusion and we were quickly handed off to a server who grabbed two menus, a kids menu (we don't have kids) and began to run away without asking us to follow her.  We got seated and I must say that our server was GREAT under the circumstances that she was given.  Unfortunately, she was rushed and had little support and this made our experience seemed rushed.  (If any of you have seen waiting, I pictured our server as being the waitress who goes outside and yells and screams.)  \\n\\nWe shared a couple of plates and though we were given extra plates to eat off of, we had to use those same plates for each course as they did not provide a clean plate for the different courses.  Also, our water glasses were not filled even though they said they were going to do so.  \\n\\nThe food was just good and when you have to drive 20 minutes or so, and you are expecting 4 diamond food and service, good is not good enough.  There are better Italian food restaurants closer to me (Pinos and Gaspers) that I would prefer to go to.  I cannot say any of the food was bad, but I will not go back to Tuscany.  It's too bad that they did change their menu as it sounds like it was great.\n"

aS"Tried this restaurant this past Friday for the first time.  Fodor's called it the best restaurant in Phoenix, etc etc.  Someone told me they had a coupon for  two entrees, two salads or soup and a bottle of wine for $44. Sounds fair, right?  We were served two pieces of bread (one for each of us) with oil infused oil.  The one I make at home is better.  Not enough herbs to really flavor it.  We asked for more bread and they didn't seem happy.  Two pieces of bread again.  Never saw that before, counting the heads at the table and then matching the bread pieces. Most restaurant give you a chunk of bread and that's that. The salads were small, fresh but nothing special (what do you want for a coupon???)  The entree choices for the coupon were either pastas or chicken dishes everything is excluded unless you want to pay more.(what do you want with a coupon???) No side dishes come with it. You have pay extra.  (What do you want with a coupon?) I ordered chicken a la berto. Which had fontanelle cheese, spinach, and pancetta.  It was just ok. nothing special.  I didn't bring my magnifying glass to find the pieces of pancetta. (what do you want with a coupon???)  My husband hated his.  I tasted it. Flavorless.  It was chicken something. The word Oggi was in it  and his attraction to the dish was that it had sun dried tomatoes.  I think they took one sun dried tomato, cut it in half and then took that half and cut that half into minuscule pieces and spread it around the plate. As I said before, I didn't have my magnifying glass with me to let him see what mini- sun dried tomatoes look like.. My poor hubby, no sun dried tomatoes for you! (What do you want with a coupon?)  We ordered a side dish, for which we paid extra, of rigatoni with marinara sauce. Rigatoni was cooked al dente perfectly and the sauce was good.  But not better than the one I make at home from scratch from fresh tomatoes.  Don't you guys expect restaurant food to be better than your own?  I do. And finally, the bottle of wine. Not the best and a little vinegary.  (what do you want with a coupon?) \\nI guess everyone knows the conclusion to this review.  If Fodor's called La Fontanella the best restaurant in Phoenix, then Phoenix is a very small town with very few italian restaurants.  I, for one, will not be going back with or without a coupon.\\n\\nBy the way, I have eaten at Bel Fiore's, an unpretentious, no white table clothed restaurant on Cave Creek and the food is one thousand times better.

If either of those doesn\'t work for you, then plan on waiting in a long line and getting terrible service at the bar.    Don\'t let my opening statement steer you away, there is potential for a good time here.  Of the handful of times I\'ve subjected myself to the low scale, high priced, barely 20 something bar, I\'ve had fun twice.   The key both of those times was getting a table!! The waitress counts on you for her tips, so she will be attentive and she has \\pull\\"""" with the bartender so you can get your drinks way quicker.   Every time I\'ve had to go to the bar, I\'ve been completely ignored. Now, I\'m no supermodel, but I\'m not too sore on the eyes either... not even my D cups worked!  At our last visit we actually ordered some appetizers, they were just okay, but exactly what I would expect from bar food.  I struggle with my rating because I would give Junkie a 3 for the two times I had a good experience, but 1.5 for the others.  I guess that tells me that my fellow yelpers have done us solid with a current rating of 2.5."""""""\n'

aS"The service here is horrible! I've had better at McDonalds. For being a restaurant in The Phoenician, I expected better service. It was as quiet as a library. It was a 4 hr dinner that shouldve been 2. We asked for a sommelier to come to give us a wine suggestion... Finally we just picked it ourselves. The food was ok. There's so many better places in Scottsdale. If you are here from out of town (I am a local), I suggest leaving The Phoenician to get much better service and food elsewhere. I'm giving it two stars only because the bunnies were cute that were running around.\n"

Complimentary chips and salsas, on the surface, are a nice add, but the store bought corn chips were stale  and  the salsas not very good at all.\\nI think that \\this side of the border\\"""" refers to the border between them  and  the closest Filibertos.

aS'"""Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.\\n\\nI already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don\'t want to end your day wanting to staple things to people\'s heads, I would stay away from this dealership.\\n\\nI walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I\'m also a car fanatic. \\n\\nI didn\'t mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. \\n\\nSoon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.\\n\\nWe all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. \\n\\nI told him that the trade in value wasn\'t acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.\\n\\nSince it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn\'t desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn\'t want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.\\n\\nThings quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don\'t put enough miles on my car and it\'s stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I\'m out then. If that wasn\'t enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn\'t know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn\'t comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.\\n\\nIn the end I let him know that this wasn\'t going anywhere and that I didn\'t think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, \\You can have whatever you want.\\""""\\n\\nI was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. \\n\\nSlightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn\'t want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)"""""""\n'

It was tight around the neck and when he knelt down it felt and looked like it was going to split.  \\nWhen we voiced our concerns to the woman working there (she is the owner), she got this snotty attitude and acted like we were absolutely ridiculous for wanting a tux that fit comfortably.

aS'"""I purchased a Travelzoo Local Deal for this spa and it included a facial and use of spa facilities. This spa and resort has a stellar reputation and I was very much looking forward to it and had high expectations. I get facials approximately every 2 months and have never encountered the damage inflicted upon my skin as I did yesterday.\\nA normal facial typically includes \'extractions\' and I always agree to this procedure. I agreed to have the employee perform a few extractions thinking that at a 5 star resort/spa it would be fine. It was far from fine. Typically you are not supposed to \'force\' an extraction and most times if it is difficult, they stop. She did major damage to my skin. I left the room with large red welts on my face. I assume she realized what she had done because she kept repeating to me that \\those will eventually fade\\"""" and kept telling me it\'s normal. I have never in my life had a facial where I looked worse than when I walk in. I have very clear skin, no acne, no scars and I walked out looking like I was stung by bees. The swelling and redness did eventually go down , but I had to cancel plans that night because of my appearance (yes, vanity kicked in). However upon waking up this morning I have scabs or what appears to look like areas where I\\""""ve been \'picking\' at my skin. These were the extraction sites. They are not swollen any longer, but are still red and may possibly leave scars. Because they are open areas of my skin, I am hesitant to put makeup on them as I want them to heal properly. I now have to walk around with these scabs on my face. I\'m quite upset about this obviously.\\nI can\'t fathom how this place thinks this woman is qualified to give facials, especially where they normally charge $175 for this service. I paid $119 and have damage to my face. While the spa itself was very nice, I was horrified at the appearance of my face and did not enjoy the facilities . On top of that I was forced to pay $45 for gratuity BEFORE I had my treatment. In no way did this woman deserve a tip.. she has damaged my skin!\\nWhile the resort and facilities are great, I\'d never allow them to touch my face again."""""""\n'

aS"My comments have nothing to do with this dealership's new-car service; instead, I'm going to vent a little about what happened when I visited both the Parts and Service departments at Superstition Springs Chrysler Jeep this morning. I went to the parts counter first, looking for a simple plastic trim fastener used for reattaching the door panel on my Jeep. You can buy a 50-piece bag of these plastic fasteners on Amazon for $9.95, but I wanted to finish the job I'd started now and didn't want to wait on Amazon. The parts guy looks it up on his computer, and with a straight face tells me that just one of these fasteners is $7.50! No way, I thought, so on my way out I stopped by the service counter to ask for the cost of a coolant flush. The service guy looks it up and comes back with $149.00  -- $50 more than either of the other nearby Jeep dealerships. So here's my take on Superstition Springs Chrysler Jeep: if you need parts or non-warranty service, stay away from this place. Just my 2 cents, of course, but it looks to me like these guys will hose you big-time on parts and service.\n"

Not only do I disagree with all of these reviews but I felt as if I was having these positive reviews shoved down my throat and if, god forbid, I felt differently than the reviews then I was some sort of freak. \\n\\nOn to the food. I ordered a \\""""Little Bacon Cheeseburger\\"""". It was 4.99. Apparently I am paying $1 for each one of the \\""""Guys\\"""" in \\""""Five Guys\\"""". I hope the appreciate it. For myself and the two others with me the meal total was $29.00. Yes, $29.00. I could have gone to Red Robin and probably paid less.\\n\\nWho cares about the expensive prices though, right? I mean, they give you free peanuts when you walk in. That makes everything better. There is nothing I want more with my burger than a box full of peanuts. \\n\\n/sarcasm\\n\\nBut yea, the burger didn\'t impress me. It was so sloppy. With every bite I lost about 1/4 of the toppings to the table. It wasn\'t a terrible burger, but it was by no means HAMBURGER HEAVEN. The fries were huge. We got the regular, not cajun, and they were as regular as can be. I liked that they were crispy, however they tasted a bit bland and had to be drowned in ketchup to salvage any taste. \\n\\nFive Guys does have hot dogs. I tried half of one to get an idea of how they were. It was pretty good. I liked it, although would not make a trip back just for a hot dog. The hot dog came in at 3.99, which compared to the burger is a steal. \\n\\nAbout the Five Guys vs In\'n\'Out argument. I didn\'t find it possible to compare to In\'n\'Out since one uses special sauce and the other uses conventional condiments like ketchup and mustard. If Five Guys used Thousand Island like In\'n\'Out, maybe we could compare, but they don\'t. When it comes to fries, though, In\'n\'Out has the edge in my opinion. \\n\\nSo basically I walked out of Five Guys with a much lighter wallet and a huge \\""""meh\\"""". If I ever want to take my future family out to try Five Guys, I better start a trust fund for them now so we can afford it."""""""\n'

I drive by this place almost every day on my way home from physical therapy, so when it was featured on Doozy of a Deal, I jumped at the chance to buy a coupon. \\n\\nMy husband and I came here after hiking in the McDowell Mountain preserve. I had the Mediterranean omelet with a pancake and he had the malted waffle with a side of home fries. My omelet was good, but the cooks foiled my attempt to make it healthy by cooking it in oil. I literally picked up the omelet and put it on a napkin, and the napkin soaked up its oil. Gross. My pancake was very dense and kind of dry. Not light and fluffy like pancakes should be. \\n\\nMy husband's waffle was pretty pathetic. Also dense and flavorless. Here's the scary part: the server dropped off the syrup and it was all frothy...we tasted it and we think it was fermenting.

I wasn't surprised to find out that Cho Dang is in a league of its own when it comes to Korean BBQ in CHandler.  Takamatsu was as underwhelming as it gets.\\n\\nThe decor is like a cafeteria.  Patrons are very loud.  It seems that everyone goes there for the all you can eat sushi.  The person who sat us thought we were there for it and our server did a triple take when we didn't have anything filled out on the sushi form.  Call me a sushi snob all you want, but I don't go to a Korean place to get my fix, and if I did, I wouldn't go to an all you can eat place.  I'm not trying to maximize calories, I am trying to maximize flavor.\\n\\nWe ordered two dishes we routinely get at Cho Dang, Bulgogi and another dish. we had some miso soup that was included which was good.  That is literally impossible to screw up because it comes from either a powder or a cube.  No points for not screwing that up.  \\n\\nOut came the sides and the dishes.  This is when it got very disappointing.  The sides were inedible.  Most were very bland while others were just bad.  I don't think any side was edible.  The bulgogi was decent, but still not as good as I'm used to.  The other dish was poorly executed and just tasted bad.  \\n\\nOverall, the place was really bad.  They deserve 1 star but if I could I would be generous and give them a 1.5 stars because we ate the bulgogi and didn't leave completely unsatisfied.  I'll never go back considering there is Korean food that is in a different league just down the street on Ray and Arizona.  \\n\\nThis place looked like a chinese buffet, and the food execution was on the same level.  I didn't see a single Korean there eating which is a bad sign.  I saw a ton of wannabe sushi eaters, a few SE-Asians and several old people. \\n\\nI gave it a shot once and won't be back.  Worst Korean food I've ever eaten without question.  Yelp reviewers are really starting to get a bad rap with me.  If this is the best Korean BBQ you have had, what places could possibly be worse?\n"

I would have to say ...The food was fair ..But they have a LONG way to go for customer service. Which by the way I have been in Rest/bar biz for 24 years. Sad but True\n'

aS'This night at Red Lobster was the worst. We came here on a Saturday night. We had to wait but, not a problem at all. You expect that on a busy night. The place is under construction and that is not good to keep it open while that is going on. It actually smelled like chemicals and building materials. The worst part about this night was our waiter Bob. He had no interest in doing a good job that night or in making any money apparently. We had the worst possible service that you could imagine. Old and cold coffee, wrong drinks and ,he even put the wrong number on our order. So that when someone else brought out our food they could not find us.  The cheese biscuts are not what they used to be, All fake ingredients in my book. Not happy at all with our experiance here, I absolutly will say we will never be back.\n'

aS"Dropped in here to pick up a few items during the Christmas shopping period. It was tough because they had a new guy working and he didn't know how to use the computer real well so checkout took forever. I normally wouldn't hold that against an establishment, but it was how the supervisor handled it that I'm giving them 2 Stars. Instead of helping the guy through the entire process, he would only help a little and then leave him alone, which made the process agonizingly slow. \\n\\nI could understand if he was doing this to assist other customers, but he wasn't. He was flirting with the other 2 girls who worked there...talking about whether they liked the new Samsung Galaxy or the iPhone 5...ridiculous. \\n\\nI felt really bad for the new guy. I hope it gets better for him. I bought what I needed and then bolted out of there. It took 20 min to get through my checkout....no exaggeration. \\n\\nReturn Factor - 30%\n"

aS"We had a quick lunch as part of a business meeting and hoped to find a new choice for downtown.  The service was attentive as the restaurant was nearly empty (at 11:45 am), but our server knew next to nothing about the menu items.  He also seemed incapable of making eye contact, which was just odd.  The lentil soup was very good, though the portion was also very small.  I coupled that with a flat bread that was somewhat bland.  My guest had a chopped salad that she had to send back once.  When it came out again, it was fine, but nothing about it stood out.  All in all, it seems like your standard hotel restaurant--eat there if you're stuck in the building, but get out if you're not.\n"

Ended up putting my hand up, telling her just to stop, and walked out with wet hair, which was neon yellow and looked like Big Bird.  Besides being totally damaged.  If they offered, as she did, would YOU go back to a place like this and let them try to fix it?  I think not.  Had to live with that embarrassment for weeks before I could go to someone who knew what they were doing and get normal hair again.  Also, the place is filthy and has only one sink, so you sit and wait to be rinsed out until that chair opens up.  So you're sitting there with chemicals burning your head and overprocessing.  It's normal for gossip in a salon but these women talk loudly about very personal and inappropriate matters (including about other employees who aren't present), AND fight with their husbands on the phone in front of clients.

However my experience last night changed my opinion of the restaurant. I am solely basing my review on this experience. \\n\\nLast night I went through the drive-thru and when I came to the window, I noticed individual styrofoam cups sitting on top of the soda fountain. A few seconds later I saw an employee drinking out of a styrofoam cup. He took a few sips, and then poured out the rest of his cup into the soda fountain drain below the dispensers. That freaked me out a bit, but not as much as what happened next. \\n\\nHe then rinsed out his cup using the water dispenser on the fountain. He sloshed it around and then poured out the contents. The contents splashed all over the dispenser and into the ice maker that was just below the drain. He then placed his drinking cup on top of the dispenser with the rest of the styrofoam cups. Water was still dripping off the side of the cup and on to the fountain.  A second later another employee started filling my cup with ice from the same ice maker.  \\n\\nWhen I expressed disgust at what I had just observed, I was told, \\It is okay.\\""""  I am not sure that she understood what I was trying to tell her, because she was confused as to why I no longer wanted a soda.

I am giving four stars for an always cozy atmosphere and a nice patio.\\n\\nI had the enchiladas which had a nice kick, especially the pork. But the quality if the food in relation to the price is what gets me. Everything is good but not great enough to warrant the prices. And the service is almost always lacking.\\n\\nThis particular time, we seemed to be the victim of our server going on break and their being a breakdown in communication or coordination. In any case, we had to  wait a while before our drinks were refilled and my salad was forgotten. Our server was nice and apologetic so no worries. Not always the case as some servers make it clear that they are way above looking after the likes of us.\\n\\nSo overall, not a bad place, the prices, quality and atttiude serve as enough of a deterrent to patronize again in the future.\n'

This seemed to carry into the restaurant a little bit too. Despite this problem, we proceeded to order and try out the place.\\n\\nI ordered up the Vegetarian combo that comes with a greek salad, hummus, tiropita (cheese pie), falalfel and pita bread.

Arrived shortly after happy hour, and were seated at a high top next to the back door.  Not a great table--I immediately noticed the stains on the wall next to the table (soy sauce?).   We ordered the pork potstickers, which were tiny and overcooked.  I asked for the mustard to come on the side, so they didn't give us any.  Next came the hot lips roll--sounded good but looked like a pink mayo-globbed mess, no way to eat with chopsticks, and forget picking it up with your hands!   My date liked it,  however.   I had a little sushi (nigiri), sake and maguro--decent quality.  My date had the beef and broccoli, which was decent, and I asked for a side order of the wok vegetables.  I expected my vegetables to be a small side dish, but they came out as big as an entree.   Quantity, but not quality--they were mushy and sitting in a puddle of soy sauce (couldn't make out any other flavors).   Service was so-so, maybe because we were hidden in the corner.  I'm glad we had a gift card, or I would have been even more disappointed.  Better sushi at AJ's, honestly.\n"

aS"Based strictly on the resort and room, I would have given this place more stars.  The rooms were nice and quite comfortable.  Although the bathroom did get soaked with every shower since there wasn't any sort of barrier to keep the water in.  \\n\\nThe reason I gave it fewer stars is because of the headache I am still experiencing several months later.  I had incorrect charges from someone else's spa package that were charged to my room, which I was told were taken care of twice after they made me swear I didn't go to the spa.  Uh, the person staying in that room was a 23 year old man who was with us the entire time, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't get manis/pedis and facials on the reg.  But, yes, everything was cleared up after a few phone calls.\\nSecond, because of plane trouble we ended up not checking in until 6 in the morning, and we were told they would not charge us for those two rooms for the night before.  That was a lovely surprise!  Then they did.  I just wanted clarification, and after multiple phone calls, messages, and finally a terse message left with the GM, I finally was told the charges would fall off my card in February.  Guess what....  It's April.  Charges are still there.  I've left more messages... no return calls.\\n\\nSo, needless to say, I would recommend it, but double-triple check your bill and be prepared to argue.\n"

SO I ended up ordering the half chopped liver with rye.\\n\\nThe chopped liver was piled quite high but the sandwich was quite small for the 7 bucks. However I like small portions so this didn't bother me too much Mimi's across the 101 serves similar portions and I don't ind paying for it.

Service is always mediocre, no matter how busy or slow.  Our server on this occasion was actually a cutie pie and was very good natured as some of the boys at our table were flirting and joking with her and even as worn out as the poor thing was, she still interacted and had fun with them.  My complaint (having been a server before) is the way they had servers assigned to tables.  She not only had inside tables, but the patio as well.  When it is busy like this they need to be more strategic about assigning sections to servers so they are not constantly running.  The needs of the customer are bound to get neglected and their staff is going to be ragged not even halfway into a very long football Sunday. \\n\\nThis time around at BWW I had the fried mushrooms with a house salad.  I can honestly say these are probably the worst fried shrooms I've ever had.  Extremely doughy with a mushroom the size of a button inside.  Yuck.  The salad was far from fresh.  The lettuce was obviously wilted and that was pretty much all there was to it with the exception of a cucumber or two and some tomatoes.

aS"Who doesn't enjoy a lazy Sunday morning? I love spending time leisurely reading the Sunday news while getting caught up on a weeks worth of cooking shows. After a few hours hunger finally sets in and its time to find something cheap and easy. While that might sound more like a lifestyle choice than a way of eating, cheap and easy to me means dim sum, and lots of it. With a fistful of cash and my growing appetite I head over to my default dim sum house, Golden Buddha. \\n\\nLocated in the Chinese Cultural Center, Golden Buddha has been pushing carts every weekend for the past few years. Over those years they've become a destination for steamy delights and have built quite a following with groups usually packing the lobby. Here's some advice, for a lesser selection with no waiting, go early. If you want more selection and don't mind the wait, go after noon. \\n\\nRanging in price from $2.35-$6.50, Golden Buddha pretty much offers mainstream selections from dumplings and chicken feet to rice and noodles. Most of the cart pushers don't speak much English but know this; most items are either made with pork or shrimp. \\n\\nWithin minutes of being sat the first smiling server rolls up her cart and begins pimping her wares. As she lifts the steel lid from the first steam basket, the mist dissipates to reveal 3 white fluffy hidden treasures beneath. Know as char siu bao, or steamed BBQ pork buns, these are pretty standard for any dim sum brunch. Pulling apart one of the doughy pillows reveals its sweet porky center, add some chile oil for added depth. Probably the most typical offering is the pork dumplings or sui mai, a wonton wrapper filled with ground pork and black mushrooms. These meaty bites have an enjoyable earthiness that left me wanting to ask for another basket.\\n\\nThe next cart to come along is absolutely filled with fried items. I love the crispy crunch of egg rolls and while the GB version was crisp, the inside was filled with oil that tasted like last nights fish. After only a single bite the rest remained untouched. Seemingly fried in the same oil, the salt and pepper shrimp were not only super fishy but the shells were also left on. Shell on shrimp isn't usually a problem when the shrimp in question is cooked really well. Not the case with these, they were ruined before they even hit the table, greasy and salty.\\n\\nOn a lighter note, wrapped in translucent rice paper, the spring rolls were large, filled with chewy rice noodles and 3 plump shrimp, unfortunately these were also flavorless. \\n\\nA new one for me was the Zhaliang, a long tubular Chinese doughnut that is tightly cocooned in a sheet of rice noodle. The end result is more about texture than bold flavor; I can see how so many people seek these out for breakfast being chewy and crispy at the same time. \\n\\nDim sum brunch isn't complete without at least one Chinese dessert. Pointing at a plate of pineapple buns or bo lo yau from the dessert cart, these pastries actually contain no pineapple. Instead the name refers to its crunchy checkered top crust. Inside the bun you'll get a sweet surprise of satisfyingly sweet custard filling.\\n\\nWhile I left satisfied, overall Golden Buddha doesn't quite have the chops they used to, but in a pinch or on a lazy Sunday morning, they'll do just fine.\n"

aS"I went to take advantage of the free ticket deal to see the Immortals with friends - but when we arrived, the theater had suffered a burnt-out bulb and we were forced to see Twilight instead.  While that might be grounds for a negative star review and a human rights complaint, I opted to tolerate it for the sake of science.\\nThe theater is about what I've come to expect.  The service is good - you have a call button you can push and the waiter'll come running out to you - and they pretty much cater to your every whim while you relax and watch your movie.  However, the food is hilariously overpriced, which I did anticipate, so I can't say it was a shock to me.  But it's not getting any Michelin stars, let's put it that way.\\nThe major dealbreaker - the reason I give this place a bad review - is the seating.  Half is theater seating, which is maybe one step above your normal theater seating, and the other half were office chairs with desks in front of them.  Okay, sure, they're NICE office chairs, but the place just opened.  Wait three months and see how nice they are then.\\nWhy is this a dealbreaker if the chairs are sufficiently comfy and the service is respectable, and you knew what you were in for, you might ask me.  Well, here's the kicker.  There are other dinner theaters in this city, and while their tickets are generally more expensive, the general experience is much, much better.  So if you grade comparatively, SMG just loses out.  \\nNow, if you're cheap, then just go for it - get there early, get good and soused at Four Peaks across the way first - but if you're looking for a novel, quality movie going experience... look elsewhere.\n"

This Yardhouse is in a shopping mall, please go somewhere else.\\n\\nService  and  food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley.  Beer selection is great but not so great.  If you're a beer enthusiast, you've already tried at least 90% of the beers.  If you're not a beer enthusiast, you probably won't care that there's so many beers to choose from.  I think they missed the mark by having tons of widely available beers at one place rather than having a lot of hard to find beers that people will like to try for the first time.\\n\\nPrices are too high - $6 pints, $10 for most appetizers, and again - this location is bad for parking and customers.\n"

As the drink neared its end, another appeared promptly. The glass was never empty, which being someone who is constantly thirsty, is a good sign. \\n\\nThe burgers now come with the endless fries. I was there previously and the fries had to be ordered separately. I found the fries to be very good. A little crunchy, but not too crunchy. The burger was a good size. I cut it in half and could only finish one half. I went with the Hula - which is a cheeseburger with Swiss, tomato and mushrooms. The burger was a little messy. It had condiments on it and the combination of condiment and grease made for a messy burger. Most guys don't really mind messy food, and I am among that list. What I didn't like was the burger was extremely salty. I assume the mushrooms were saut\\u00e9ed probably in garlic salt - but I think there was a bit much.

I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn\'t work.

Mostly just bring the dish and describe without a smile and leave. \\n\\nFood: We decided that my husband would order an ala carte dish and I would go with the tasting menu to get the full effect.  The amuse bouche were interesting, but I wouldn't say that I was all too impressed.  They were not particularly tasty bites.  For the ala carte, my husband ordered the veal, and we were quite disappointed.  The meat was tough and quite bland.  The side dish of white beans that came with it was delicious though.   For the tasting menu, I understand that portions are smaller (and I don't eat large portions), but they were ridiculously small.  I ordered a ceviche or the cold appetizer, soft shell crab for the hot, rib eye for the meat and halibut for the fish.  The rib eye was super thin, and almost like beef jerky.  Although the flavoring was decent, it was so small and tough that it was a bit hard to eat.

Having eaten at Houston's (in Houston), I thought this would be a great place to get a steak.  I was probably shooting a little high.  Service was good, but there were issues with the food.  First off they ran out of baked potatoes, not a big deal but perhaps a little foreshadowing?  The Steak came out with no red in the center, probably a solid medium.  The redone steak came out a little more pink (not red), but still did not have the deep, meaty flavor I was craving.  The Fish sandwich we ordered was good, as were the cole slaw and broccoli sides.  In other words, I would come back here for lunch (the fish sandwich), but not the steak.  I can't comment on the sushi, maybe this is what they are concentrating on.

aS"A PERFECT marriage between Party On  and  Bottom Of the Barrel.  First experience here reminded me of what happens to us all after a few too many to drink.  A friend wanted to show me out and suggested this location to end the night after 2a.m. Lets just say the cab didn't get far before I got back in.  It was a mix of 'clicks' still dancing the night away surrounded by the hopefuls and out of shape-late 40 something's preparing to pounce at the first sight of a wounded gazelle.  Looks like I better try this place out once more under different circumstances as the previous reviews show it may have  potential.\n"

aS'"""Planned to stay for a relaxing labor day weekend.  Purchased tickets on their own website and selected the room with a golf course view for $10 extra than the regular price.  It appeared to be a good deal since the reviews on Tripadvisor gave the resort a 4.5 (out of 5) star rating for customer reviews.  Along with the resort rating of being a 4star facility, we thought we should be fine.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we did not stay longer than an hour!  \\n\\nThe hotel itself had character with an old southwestern decor.  The approach to the property was welcoming with  spectacular landscaping.  Customer service was good with friendly and courteous staff (mostly from the valet and door guys), although the front desk staff were pleasant and not directly rude!\\n\\nWe were given our room and went to start our relaxing weekend only to find the room we had did not have a golf course view (well... it would have if there were not two huge trees in front of the window!)  The room was small but nicely decorated.  My hubby (affected by allergies, hay fever etc) began sneezing almost immediately on entering the room, which was due to the dust layer on window shutters, phone, table, tv stand and headboard - dusty as though the room had not been used for a few weeks!  We called the front desk to ask if we might be able to move rooms -  the person on the phone said \\Let me see what we can do\\"""" and then the phone went dead.  We waited for about 5 minutes to see if he would call back but nothing!  Strange... we assumed he put the phone down by accident and didn\'t make a note of our room!  So we called back again and spoke to a lady who said \\""""OK give me a moment to see what we have and i will call you back\\"""".  This time we waited about 10 minutes but no call back.  Obviously, my hubby could not stay in the room during the this time and we were simply waiting in the area of the room in case a manager came to see what our problem was.  We ended up going back to the reception and spoke to yet another person.  I explained we had spoken to two other people but that comment was ignored and none of the other staff identified that I had spoken to them even though they all could hear me!  The young lady said she would look to see if there was another available room, after a while she offered a casita but noted it was 50ft smaller than the room we were in - I asked if she meant 50sq ft and she said \\""""no, 50 feet\\""""!!!!  Anyway, before I digress on such a minor point, my husband asked if it was possible we could have a refund.  She said \\""""yes no problem\\"""" without a fuss - I believe this was only because we had booked directly on their site, not using Priceline or other such service (which we use a lot ourselves and have had great service through).  We left and booked into the JW Marriott Desert Ridge (paid more but had a stress free, clean, pleasant and relaxing weekend).  Both these are rated 4star but in our well traveled experience, the Scottsdale Resort should be rated 2.5 or 3 star.   \\n\\nWe agree with the resort fees being a rip off - just like the airline charging baggage fees.... put it in the overall cost and don\'t tell us about it, unless we ask for a breakdown.  Adding it on after you arrive is a real turn off!"""""""\n'

aS'"""Visited 5.27.2012 (@2:45pm)\\n\\nThis is only the second time that I have eaten at this location and my boyfriend and I had pretty terrible service.  When we walked and asked if we could sit outside the hostess handed us menus and told us to sit wherever.  So we did. We sat there for about 15 minutes.  A few waitresses smiled at us but no one asked if we had been helped. \\n\\nFinally, a waitress came over who didn\'t know the price differences between domestic or foreign beer - only new the specials.  Then she left to find out how much a Kiltlifter draft would be - $6 (kind of pricey) but my boyfriend ordered one anyways.  I ordered a bloody mary.  The drinks seemed to take a long time and the waitress explained that my bloody mary was what was holding things up. Truthfully it wasn\'t busy at all and the bartender should have had no problems pouring a draft beer and mixing vodka with bloody mary mix pretty quickly.  When the drinks came (brought by a different waitress) there were no garnishments for my drink.  I had to get up to get my own (no bloody mary bar either).  The food came, again from a different waitress, but we had no napkins or silverwear.  I stole one off of the table next to us and went in for another. When I asked the bartender - he told (rather rudely) a waitress to \\get her a place setting.\\""""  I was really appalled by the way he spoke to her.  We started eating and the original waitress stopped by to see how our meal was and the food was pretty good so we both said good.  \\n\\nWhen the bill came I was pretty disappointed that the waitress did not inform us that there would be an up-charge for sweet potato fries.  So his burger and my Caesar chicken wrap were $13 each. \\n\\nHaving been to many downtown restaurants where I have received great service I could not let this experience go by without saying something.  I regret not saying something at the time but the staff didn\'t seem to appreciate our patronage in the first place.  Go to Arrogant Butcher if it is open instead.\\n\\nS~"""""""\n'

The one I tried was full of flavor, moist and plump.

Thats right they breaded over the shell. You had to peel the breading off so you could take the shell off.  What a friggin mess.

aS"What the F, Chelsea's?\\n\\nWe've been coming here since day one, and I wouldn't call it our 'favorite' restaurant, but it's probably the restaurant we visit most frequently. Why? It's just so gosh-darn good, and very consistent. You can always find us at the bar--the bartenders are always beyond friendly, and we love looking out at their gorgeous patio and marveling at how they've covered up that nasty ass canal (DON'T HATE, we ride bikes on the canal, and that is a particularly gross patch). You can't go wrong starting off with the sangria, a glass of wine, or a margarita (one of the best in town), and I could close my eyes, blindly point to something on the menu, and be totally happy with whatever arrived. \\n\\nWhy did it suck so badly on our last visit? It was busy, although not any busier than usual on a Saturday night. We snagged a seat at the bar and after awhile the bartender handed us a sticky, ketchup-caked menu. No thanks. The bar surface wasn't any cleaner, so after about ten minutes I asked for a wet napkin and she finally took the hint and wiped our space down. Drinks were fine. The ceviche was so blah, I can't imagine any spice or lime went in to it. It tasted like a soupy bowl of tomatoes, and although this is one of our standbys, most of it went untouched. My husband's burger came out overcooked, as did my filet. Like, really overcooked. My green beans were soaked in butter and that was about it in the way of flavor--we asked our bartender for salt and pepper that never came.\\n\\nShe gave us a free dessert for our overcooked meals (thanks?), but I'd rather just have the old Chelsea's back.\n"

aS"As far as Cummings effectiveness against bugs in the house, I'm neither here nor there. We have a contract for them to come out every 2 months. We still have our ant problem and we still get bugs in the house. The annoying thing for me is the bug guy who stops by our house 2- 3 hours before our scheduled appointment time. Is it better than being late? I'm not so sure it is. The bug guy calls and leaves messages on our voicemail that he is at our house and wants to treat the house sooner (of course it always a time that is not convenient for me). When I explained to the scheduling lady the concept of an appointment (which is I schedule a time that works for me and they schedule a time that works for them/bug guy), I was told they would speak to him about arriving early. Now he just waits in our driveway until I get home. Perhaps I am being paranoid but the guy gives me the creeps! As soon as our contract is up, it will be 'Smell you later, Cummings!!'\n"

I wish I hadn't as not more than 50 feet from where I sat people where most likely enjoying some awesome appetizers and good food for way less.\\n\\nI tried the wings which had an odd taste but were so so. The antipasto board was terrible and for 11$ should have had a little effort to it. The food came slow as well as the service was slow and inattentive. The lady we had seemed to not be thinking about the place since we had to request a pizza to go 3 times she came back out from the back. I must note that at the time there were 2 people at the bar and one other couple in the whole place. The steak and turkey chili was pretty bad also. \\n\\n I am not a fan of pizza much besides maybe Red Devil or the now closed Western Pizza but I live with 3 females that are and not one of them cared for it. The bread was good but the sauce had the hint of toothpaste( probably from too much tomato paste) that peter piper seems to have in their equally terrible pizza. \\n\\n I can't say I will be back, I think my girl liked the martini she had but she will have to go alone if she wants another.\\n\\nI would mention that just like a terrible steak house or a Chili's you will pay more than you should for sub par dining.

aS'My husband and i went here early evening on Saturday (about 5:45pm). The place is very close to where we live and wanted to give it a shot. There was only 3 other tables that were occupied so we were seated right away. Our table had a balance issue that my husband solved by placing a napkin under one of the legs. The place was tastefully decorated, nothing too special. \\n\\nWe were greeted right away by our server and were informed about the happy hour specials that were still good until 6pm. I quickly ordered a wine flight for each of us ($2 off each flight) and an appetizer of chicken satay with pineapple salsa ( $8). We received our wines and they were all very delicious. I had the chardonnay flight ( $10) and the husband had the merlot flight ($12). \\n\\nThen the appetizer came. It was 3 skewers of chicken planted into a thick slice of grilled pineapple and a side of the salsa. I tried to take a bite of it and it was too chewy. I used my fork to slide it off the skewer and ended up getting a work out. This was way overcooked and way overseasoned. We had to put plenty of the sweet salsa on the chicken to balance out the amount of salt that was used for the chicken. So...not impressed with the satay.\\n\\nFor the entree we ordered the blackened salmon with risotto and veggies. They were out of risotto so we chose the goat cheese mashed potatoes instead. The salmon had a good flavor but was overcooked and the mashed potatoes were very good, even though I would have never knew that there was goat cheese in there. The server came over and told us that since we were sharing that if we wanted more veggies to let her know, my husband said sure I will have some. She ended up bringing out some weird stir fry veggies which did not come with the original meal ( we had steamed veggies) and we were charged $4 extra for these when the bill arrived. She really misled us, I thought she was OFFERING them. \\n\\nWe ordered the chocolate crepe with fresh fruit and creme fresh for desert ($8).The crepe was horrible in flavor and texture. The berries and creme that were inside were delicious.\\n\\nThe wine here is reasonable, and there are not many places in the westside that have this type of selection. i may go back for the wine...and that is it. The food did not impress me at all and I am so glad that the husband and I shared the plates we did get. This is usually what we do when we go for the first time to a place that is a little pricey. That way if the food is bad we do not spend so much. \\n\\nThis place may have some food that could be good, but I am not willing to take that chance. I would like to see a little more quality in the food here than what we received. I mean I have had better chicken satay at a backyard BBQ.\n'

aS'I needed 2 new front tires, dropped the car off and came back 1.5 hour later and it was done. Then the problems started. The new tires were put on the back and the old rear tires put on the front. The rear tires were both the same brand but different tread (the tire was discontinued and I had to replace the other). Anybody with a brain knows you do NOT put 2 different treads on the front of a car because the car wil not drive straight. So drove away with 2 kids in the car and the car pulling so hard to the left, that if I let go of the steering wheel for a split second I would crash into the car next to me. \\n\\nWhen I called and asked that they put the new tires on the front like I had requested they told me it could not be done because the manufacturer requires any new tires be put on the rear, even though my car is front wheel drive AND your supposed to rotate the tires front to back every 6000 miles. When i called Falken tires they told me it is only recommended to put new tires in the back but not required.\\n\\nThe discount tire solution: Try and sell me 2 new tires! I was told they could adjust things down to $98 for 2 new matching tires. I was blown away by their refusal to simply mount the tires where I requested THEN try and sell me more tires. They ended up comping me the tires and just charging install. \\n\\nThey also misplaced one of my rim center caps. When I went inside to ask where it was, the schumck at the front who did not work on my car just tells me its wasn`t on there when I came it, but he also did not ask the guy who changed my tires. The rim is discontinued and I can not buy more. Maybe the clipped it to sell, maybe it really just spun off on the way to their shop, but I don`t think so.\n'

Too bad, could be different as  it has nice atmosphere, easy and plentiful parking.\n'

When I questioned why I had to reschedule my appointment I was told the Dr wasn't going to be able to make it in that day.

aS"I've been itching to go to FEZ for a long time based on all the other wonderful reviews. I drive by FEZ nearly every day as I work just down the street.  \\n\\nFinally went with a buddy of mine and I got razzed more than I'd like for picking out a sub-par place! That is factoring in the food and the service. I'd probably give 2.5, 3 stars for the food. I'd give 1.5 stars for the service.  Went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, although the service would have suggested otherwise. Now don't get me wrong, the waitress was very pleasant and personable, but the time that went by before we got refills or that my dining companion's DIET COKE was fixed to a regular coke took too long. Me not being a soda drink couldn't care less about diet vs. regular but I know, I know, you soda drinkers need to have it exactly as you're taste buds know. \\n\\nThe food: I already had a lunch so just got the kisra and hummus.  I must  say I was extremely impressed with the taste of the kisra....actually...I would come here for the kisra and hummus for lunch, for sure. But I would get it to go. I wouldn't come back on a lazy Sunday afternoon b/c although I'm being lazy, I don't want the service lazy.  On to my friend's lunch...he got the All-American Burger. To me, this should have come on a sesame seed bun, what's more American other than apple pie,right?  Now I understand the Mediterranean flair that is FEZ, but it just didn't seem right to call it All-American when it's more like half-American....and his salt and pepper fries were not even warm-ish. And they tasted reheated. boo.\\n\\nWe both decided this would maybe have been a better time had if we were there in the evening. I think we'll give it one more try at night and see if we don't enjoy it a little more.\\n\\nMaybe my hopes were built up b/c of all the other great reviews, maybe we came at a bad time, maybe he ordered the wrong item. Maybe I'll give FEZ another shot....but I'm not in a hurry to do that right now.\n"

aS"The ambiance was promising when we all arrived.  It was suggested that the prime rib would be the best option so I ordered the 7 oz, medium (using their menu-rankings and descriptions as a guide), plus the usual sides.\\n\\nWhat I got was essentially steak tartar, with a millimeter-thick quick sear on the outside.  On first bite I wasn't sure what I was eating, so I had a second.  Then it became apparent that the middle of the steak was not only rare, it was completely raw .. basically refrigerator-cold to the tongue.\\n\\nSo, steak sashimi not being what I wanted I waited for the server to return.  This didn't happen so I got up and went searching through the restaurant, to no avail.  I finally just stood in the middle of a busy intersection until one passed by, and explained the situation.  He could not find our server either so agreed to take it back for 'reheating'.\\n\\nA few minutes later someone higher up came and apologized and said another would would be right up.  The rest of our party continued to dine while I sat there with no dining whatsoever, no refills on water/drink etc.  About 20 minutes later my food arrived (45 mins after ordering), and everyone else was most way through theirs.  \\n\\nWith wine glass completely empty, no service for refills forthcoming, I proceeded into steak #2 with just a glass of water.\\n\\nSteak #2 was marginally better, but in lieu of medium it was just well done on the outer ring and again, all-rare tartar in the middle.\\n\\nI gave up after a few bites, just surrendered the meal altogether and just went to a taco take-out on the way back to the hotel.\\n\\nI didn't do an exhaustive review of the check but it did not look like anything was comped, though the restaurant put in a $25 gift card for a future visit.  This I regarded as a final insult, as I have no desire to return to this place and in lieu of making up for the bad meal and poor service, the only apparent apology is an invitation to come back and do it all over again.\\n\\nI hope others have a better experience.\n"

aS"Hmph... I had always wanted to try this spot, and living within walking distance for the past 3 years hasn't done much to change that, until now.  After catching a show at the Herberger, Ashley A. suggested we go here for drinks/food.  I wasn't really feeling it because I was scared of what I expected in terms of premium pricing, but we went anyway.  The elevator ride up was fun and it made my ears pop.  Once we got off the elevator though, things kind of stopped being fun and I felt like I just stepped into a closet.  It was so dark!\\n\\nI will give the Compass one thing, their service is fantastic.  Unfortunately, service does not make up for the lack of quality in food or the overwhelmingly inflated prices.  They didn't have Coke, which really irritated me, so I just had a water.  We ended up getting the Drunken Shrimp app since we weren't entirely hungry and then the Lava Cake for dessert.  The sauce with the shrimp was startlingly salty.  Even for me, and I oversalt everything.  The shrimp were okay, and there were only three.  Seriously?  20 bucks for 3 shrimp and a piece of bread.  Sheesh!  At least the desserts were priced fairly.  The lava cake was okay, but it doesn't even come close to my beloved Domino's Lava Crunch Cake.  \\n\\nAfter checking out the rather uninspired menu and it's awe inspiring prices, I won't be back.  Besides, the view from the top of the Chase Tower is much more impressive, so the view alone will not get me to come back.\n"

Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. \\n\\nThe steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.

aS'I think this company is a bait and switch scam operation. I spoke with the owner Bill over the phone and told him I was interested in protection training for my dog.

He also would not see my dog until I paid a $90 consultation fee. \\nSo I go to meet this guy, and he has with him a dog that is very well mannered, and he has a wrapped mini van so he looks professional...so my hopes are high...but after a few exercises with my dog.

And all information he knew in the questionnaire I filled out and returned...prior to our meeting up.  If i could rate this guy 0 stars in his business practices I would, their is no doubt he can train a dog...but so can anyone...I trained my dog on my own to do all the stupid pet tricks we get them to do...but I wanted more and this guy is a joke who took my money and ran.

aS'My decided to go there in Friday night. The place was empty. We arrived at 830 and had to seat ourselves on the patio because the hostess was not there. The waitresses outside, who kept looking our way, didnt bring us over a menu or take our drink orders until 9. Finally we got to order our drinks which never showed up.

aS'AMF Mesa Lanes is very similar in fashion to all of the AMF bowling lanes around the country that I have been to.  There are a couple of distinct reasons to why I give a lower rating.

Lastly, they took away our pitchers of beer at least 30 minutes before close.  I am not sure if this is protocol, but we had a designated driver and our drunk friends could have finished the beer.\n'

aS'"""I\'m definitely not the type of person who likes to give merely 1 star... but after my experience here, it\'s hard to give it anything more.  The only thing going for it really was the view... too bad though that it was too dark to see the water.\\n\\nWe went here for my birthday dinner a few nights ago.  Walked in, nice decor, but were greeted by the smirk of a man who was looking down his nose at us - especially since we didn\'t have a reservation.  The place wasn\'t busy... maybe half full, if that.  We waited patiently for about 20 minutes to be seated.\\n\\nThe waitress was... somewhat polite; I mean, she did try to cater her suggestions to her audience.  I\'m Japanese, but you know... just because I am doesn\'t mean that you need to suggest all the Asian dishes as specialties.  She did the same racial profiling to the table next to us of Italians.  While I understand her meaning behind it and I\'m sure she didn\'t mean to be offensive, I just found it odd.  Unfortunately, she also didn\'t know anything at all about the wines, but I made a selection we enjoyed anyhow. \\n\\nWe ordered the calamari as the app and it came out cold.  I personally have never enjoyed cold fried items, but hey that\'s me.  I\'m not all that sure how long it had been sitting in the window, but since it took about 30 minutes to arrive at the table I assume a while.  The whole night it felt as though our waitress was avoiding us since the calamari sat nearly untouched for at least 15 minutes until she came by with my friend\'s clam chowder soup.  The soup he said was good, but I found it slightly inexcusable that she kept walking past our table and looking at the untouched appetizer whilst she continued to service the table next to us to her fullest extent. For our entrees, he ordered shrimp 3 ways and I ordered a simple shrimp and crab pasta.  His was overcooked to the point of rubber and mine made me feel ill immediately after consumption.  We both decided to skip out on desserts due to the awful service and poor food quality.  \\n\\nOne thing that upsets me is when a restaurant ruins its ingredients and this one did.  Go for the soup and nothing else.  If you expect even a smidgen of decent service, don\'t even bother. It\'s over priced and pretentious for food that is improperly prepared.

aS"Talk about a disappointment. Restaurant week is something that my close group of friends looks forward to every year. It's a great time to experience something special from a restaurant we have not tried before. Our expectations were high are that the food and service would be impeccable since Restaurant Week is a showcase for creativity. Unfortunately, it was not the case this year. We had a reservation for 10 for Saturday evening. We were promptly seated at a long, comfortable table. However, things went down from there. First off, there were wine substitutions for the meal pairings. The pairing ($10 additional or $5 a glass) was a bargain, but the replacement wines did not match well with the food. The appetizers were a disappointment across the board. I heard negative comments about the ceviche and the corn chowder. I had the goat cheese fondue along with several others (with high praise from the server).  We all commented on its unpleasant, non-fondue-like texture and the tasteless crackers that accompanied it. The entrees fared no better. The salmon was overcooked, the tortellini was bland and the skirt steak was tough and not very favorable as skirt steaks usually are. The worst thing (noted by several others) was an artichoke and leek gratin. It was thick and dry as spackle and the worst item of the night. Nothing came out at the proper temperature. Dessert was an afterthought with a mini sampling of mediocre selections placed on a plate with no flair whatsoever. Though we enjoyed each other's company, we were completely disappointed at this subpar experience. Most said they would not come back based on this experience.\n"

aS"I've had Grimaldi's saved in my bookmarks for awhile, and this Saturday I found an excuse to go. Family dinner night! I was in charge of figuring out where to eat and since we were all craving pizza and my mom was paying, I chose this place. By the end of the night, most of my family was a little ticked off at me for my choice. \\n\\nI was super excited to try this place based on the reviews, and I am really sad that it did not live up to my expectations. I was literally expecting some of the best pizza I have ever had in my life. We come in around 7pm and its busy but we still manage to get a table right away. None of us order drinks because I think we all looked at the price of the pizza and figured this was going to be pretty expensive. We decided on two small pizzas: one half pepperoni (for my sister) and half mushroom, the other with the sweet roasted red peppers. \\n\\nThe service was a little strange. Our waiter didn't make eye contact all night. He looked at other tables, at his paper, or down at the floor when he talked to us. Was there something on our faces? I don't know, but it was really odd. The guy that delivered the pizzas to our table was nice though, and he served us all our first slice. I thought that was a nice touch. He was also very willing to get us new plates right away when the ones at our table were dirty. \\n\\nThe pizzas did not take long to come out, but I was a little surprised by them when they did. I literally couldn't tell the pepperoni or the red peppers from the sauce. The pepperonis were the tiniest I have ever seen. I didn't get any feedback from my sister or my husband on whether or not these were any good, so I am assuming they were either ok, or kind of boring. The mushrooms were flavorless and really thin. I think on my slice of pizza there were four mushrooms. Sad day, I love mushrooms. I am a little bit bothered by the fact that they still charge you $2 per topping even if you only get it on half of the pizza. Considering as well the toppings were tiny and hard to see. The red peppers were even more of a let down. $4 for that option as a topping. They were flavorless as well. And again, really sparse. The pizzas in general were really lacking in the flavor department. I tasted no specific spices, let alone no salt. The cheese was really bland as well. How can you have bland mozzarella? It seemed impossible to me. \\n\\nSo by the end of the meal my whole family was annoyed with me because we could have gone to any other pizza place and gotten 3 times as much pizza for half the price. Two small pizzas with essentially two (marginal) toppings cost $40. No drinks, no wine, no salad, no desert. My mom didn't say it, but she wasn't happy either, since she paid. Sorry mom, but don't worry I wont make that mistake again.\n"

The hostesses told us we can seat ourselves outside which is understandable, but we sat there for 10 minutes without being greeted by a waiter and it wasn't even busy. I told the hostess we havent been waited on and told her where we were sitting and she looked confused and said okay. 20 minutes later we got up and told them we would go eat somewhere else and the hostesses that were his standing there said okay in a sarcastic way. I was so dissapointed because we even had our food picked out because we looked at the menu online and wanted to visit the gift shop to buy some Jimmy Buffet souveniers.

Finally I was able to order a another round of drinks, vodka and peach tea. \\n\\nMeanwhile we watched a everyone else get their main courses while we waited for our appetizers for another 10-15 minutes.  So we are now nearly 40 minutes since entering the place. \\n\\nFinally our 3 appetizers arrived via other servers, again our waitress was gone elsewhere. \\n\\nWe ate our appetizers which were so-so nothing special and not worth the calories and fat. \\n\\nWe received our check and i had been charged for 2 teas, so we questioned this and the waitress said it was a mistake she would fix it.   We gave her 2 cards to split the bill... 25 minutes later we flagged down the manager who said he would get this resolved. \\n\\nHe promptly brought us a new check.  \\Hang on\\"""" wheres our credit cards we gave over 25 minutes ago!!.   He went and found the waitress.  She presented us with a split bill finally but didn\'t take the tea off.   So I hunted for the manager and explained the mistake he said he would take care of it.   \\n\\nNow nearly 40 minutes had gone by and he presents me with one half of the bill and removed the $3 tea....?   \\n\\nNow I tried to explain that the folder I gave back to him had 2 slips in it to half the bill and he needed to redo the bill with the tea deducted....  The manager was clueless... finally brought us two checks but only one had the $3 removed... by this time we were so worn out and happy to see our cards back... it was 55 minutes since we handed them over that we paid, left a just tip for the service and left wondering what all the attraction was about.\\n\\nNo Appology no comps, Manager seemed pissed that I would complain about being over charged and made us wait while they kept our cards."""""""\n'

aS"5 of us ate lunch there yesterday.  3 had burritos.  2 didn't.  The the three that had the burritos have been so sick all day today!!!  Vomiting, diarrhea, chills, aches.  Unreal.  My husband is a doctor and he reported this to the health department but they said they have to wait until more people report a problem!  We called the restaurant and they didn't seem to care.  My two sons and daughter in law are all still sick.  \\nThey didn't eat anything but ice cream after the lunch and one son didn't even eat that.  So it had to be Frank  and  Lupe's.  I am so upset.  We drove home to CA with one son who was so sick in the car.  The sick ones are young healthy people.  Sure hope no children or old people eat there until they solve this problem!!!!!!\n"

aS'"""So we walk in at 11:15 AM. and the place is completely empty. (This is during peak college year). The disappointment of not seeing any hot ASU broads was only the beginning of a variety of disappointments during this lunch. So lets start with the good. The waitress was nice. Ok, now the bad: I ordered the lunch special pizza which was an 8 inch pizza and a drink for like $6. The waitress warned me that the pizza \\was extremely small\\"""" (at least i think she was talking about pizza) so anyways i ordered 2 of them. When the pizza came out, I wouldn\'t have been surprised if i saw part of a Digornos pizza box stuck to the bottom of the pizza. What is wrong with pizza in Arizona?! I\'ve never been to big city where saying the word \\""""Domino\'s\\"""" causes very moist orgasms.  Mellow Mushroom tries way too hard with the crust, they sprinkle this garlic dust all over it and it sucked. It tasted like you were trying to eat an old shiny piece of bread. The cheese was so thick and rubbery, you could probably use it to cover severe war wounds  This place blew big ones, it had cool decorations on the walls, but i can\'t  friggin eat decorations."""""""\n'

aS"Much of their services do not provide any real relief to back pain.  The services involved a heat treatment with tens machine and then stretching by Dr. Baca.  All of these things can be done at home and you save a copay.  He will try to get you on other services not needed to get more money into the practice.  He is one of very few that offer MUI services but most insurance providers do not cover so proceed with caution as they will tell you its 100% covered. The back office people are very non responsive, atrocious,  in calling back when questions are asked for insurance coverage.  What they will tell you is that it is covered only to find out from your health care provider that Triad never called.

aS'"""I can only do three things to my hair: straight, regular curls, or up in a clip/ponytail. My 5 year anniversary was coming up so I thought it would be fun to have someone style it for me before my fancy dinner date with Hubby. It turned out to be an irritating experience. \\nI planned my whole day around this appointment (4 P.M.). I hate being late to anything, so I booked it over to the Drybar and arrived right on time. The thing was, they were not on time. FAR from it. I was asked my name and then told that I would have to wait 10 minutes. 10 minutes later I was asked my name again and told to still wait. Almost 5 minutes later I was asked what my name was AGAIN and told to wait. I should have put on a name tag. This time I was told that a party came in 20 minutes late so everyone was running behind. I wanted to say \\that\'s not my problem, how are you going to make it better?\\"""" but I like to see how good a business is by seeing how they deal with problems and how much they appreciate business. Their way: do nothing. \\nSo 30 minutes after my appointment time (and me stewing and starting to freak out if I have enough time to get all the way home in traffic, change, do my makeup, and get to the restaurant on time), they FINALLY call me back.\\nThe girl takes me to the back sink and asks which hair style I want. They have a \\""""menu\\"""" of about 6 hairstyles. I said the Mai Tai. She said \\""""Mai Tai?\\"""" I think to myself \\""""damn it, it just gets worse.\\"""" I say \\""""yes, the beachy look.\\"""" So she said \\""""Oooooh, the one with loose big curls?\\"""" I respond with \\""""sure\\"""" (while I mentally roll my eyes wondering what she is going to do to my hair). She washes my hair and brings me to the chair. The one good thing about this girl is that she didn\'t talk much, which I like since I hate trying to hear someone talk while a blowdryer is making loud noise in my ear. While drying my hair she asks which side I part my hair. I said \\""""My bangs go this way\\"""" while I make a motion with my hand the way my bangs go. She parted it on the other side. I see a lot of the stylists have cute feathers in their hair so I ask about them. She told me they are fast and easy to do, so I say I\'ll go for a few. She finished styling my hair, which did NOT look beachy (my hair was frizzy at the top instead of smooth, and my curls were medium sized...which I could do myself...for free). It seemed like every customer was getting the same hairstyle (they looked like the \\""""southern comfort\\"""" style). I saw NO ONE that had anything different which makes me wonder why they even have a menu if you don\'t even get a choice. I was running out of time and thought maybe the cute feathers would save the look and make it look different than what I can do myself. Nope. The feathers were thin and she said she was going to put them so I can pull them out or hide them if needed. She put them under so much of my hair and they were so thin I could hardly notice them. At this point I was just done and wanted to leave asap because it was just a disaster. I kept the extensions in for 2 weeks, and not a single person noticed them because she put them under so much hair. I will never go back and just stay with my regular stylist. \\nLong story short: horrible customer service and an obnoxious experience."""""""\n'

aS"i will never go back to this place!  terrible service!!! here is what got me; we ordered a 2nd round 10 min. before happy hour was to end only to have the lazy and terrible server come over and asked if we wanted another round.  we politely reminded him that we ordered the round prior for the happy hour special.  he slowly brought us our drink and when we got our bill... guess what? we were not charged the correct price.  he used the excuse that the computer did it and that he couldn't change it.  we again reminded him that if he had brought us our drinks in a timely manor the computer would not have charged us more.  he then said he'd buy us one of the glasses.  what a jerk! please it isn't coming out of your pocket, do your job correctly!  so here is my take, this place is a copy cat of many others.  go to the places with great service and spend your money there. don't waist your time here with these rude people!\n"

aS"Heard many good things about this place and went last night for the first time for a dinner I organized with 6 friends.  It will probably be my last time there.  The interior is oddly laid out and somewhat cold, and we were seated at a table between the front door and the bathroom, about 5 feet from each.  Our waiter took our dinner order without writing any of it down.  He immediately repeated the order back to us, getting it wrong.  Then he reappeared 10 minutes later to confirm our orders once again.  Dude, write them down already!  The portions were tasty but very small for the price, and it would have been nice to have more than one tiny piece of dry bread.  Perhaps, even the option of butter?  But the service was my greatest complaint.  Even though the restaurant was only half full, people were wandering around like zombies looking for their waiters who had disappeared completely.  Our waiter kept interrupting our table's single conversation without making any effort to be graceful about it....yes, there is a right way to do it without seeming obtrusive.  And the men's room desperately needed some cleaning and attention.   \\n\\nWanted to like PastaBAR very much, but probably won't waste any more time on it.\n"

aS"Looking at the schedule of the resort activities upon arrival, we learned that Wednesday was a cowboy sing-along. No, I'm not shitting you. I love my family and we had a great time being with each other, but that really epitomized our opinion of this hokey old-person resort. \\n\\nIf you have a timeshare somewhere like Vegas or the Poconos, this place might be worth your while to swap. For us (a family that owns our timeshare in Maui), it was quite a downward step. \\n\\nThe room was smaller than our unit in Hawaii, which made little sense; it wasn't dirty, but also didn't feel as clean as other properties we've been to; a light was burned out in our room and the maintenance people neglected to fix it; and the workout room smelled like formaldehyde. \\n\\nThe Marriott hotel across the way, however, is ridiculously luxurious. So if you're not bound to renting through the timeshare, you should stay over there instead. If you are bound to the timeshare, you can still use their pools, which is well worth it.\n"

I always get a big one to go, and put in the freezer when I can't finish it, and it still tastes the same on the next day, or tastes even better after you freeze them according to my roommate.\\n\\nAnyways, this is a great place for some real froyo.

Arizona fire corn is unique and delicious, and the sweet potato fries are a winner.\\n\\nFor the entrees, if you like fish, the Pescado Veracruz is very flavorful. Also, the sonoran veggie wrap was good- but DRY, which is too bad because the sonoran sauce is delicious. Here is a hint:  you need to put it on the whole wrap, not just on the last bite! I must say I was looking forward to the Rocky Point Pizza and was a little disappointed. I expected shrimp on the pizza, not shrimp flavored puree.

aS"This past weekend, I finally had a chance to try the brunch at Postino on Central. I went as part of Smunch, my monthly brunch meetup. I was really looking forward to this, as the reviews I'd read were glowing, and Postino did not disappoint!\\n\\nI started brunch with a delightful peach bellini, and my wife and I shared an order of walnut toast with brie and fresh berry compote. The berries and brie were a fantastic combination and the bread was yummy, toasted lightly to add a bit of crunch.\\n\\nI had the French toast, which I'd heard from Georgie S. was good enough to bathe in. It lived up to its reputation, as it was warm and soft inside without being too well done on the outside. It was served with creme fraiche, berry compote and sliced strawberries. It was an altogether delightful take on a breakfast classic.\\n\\nFinally, I finished the morning with a glass of honey cucumber lemonade and a cup of coffee. The lemonade was absolutely wonderful, light and refreshing. I'm sure it's magic during the hot summer months, but even with the winter weather I found it enjoyable. The coffee is from Lola Coffee a local coffeehouse and roaster. It was slightly more bitter than I prefer, but I accept that I'm an unrepentant coffee snob, so I rate it as perfectly acceptable for a restaurant setting.\\n\\nFinally, I have to commend Postino for handling the 30+ Smunch attendees very well. Troy (the manager) had set up four tables, but the group quickly expanded to seven. The staff, especially our excellent server Jenny handled everything with grace and a smile. I was also impressed that the kitchen staff was able to turn out so many simultaneous orders while keeping the quality high.\\n\\nThe only problem was with figuring out the bill. Instead of doing separate checks or checks per table, we had three or four checks which each contained the orders for several people, but we weren't sure whose was whose. In the end, we got it handled, and since this was a special situation, I didn't feel that it should take away from the five stars I feel Postino deserves.\\n\\nOverall, Postino brunch is a resounding success!\n"

aS"This is a small family owned sub shop that's been in the same plaza in this older part of Mesa for over 30 years. This is the original but they've since expanded all over Mesa. You'll find them tucked next to the Dirty Drummer bar on the corner in the same plaza as Wendy's. It can be hard to spot if you're not looking for it. \\n\\nThey have brightly colored booth seating right when you enter. A few feet back is the counter to order. Depending on what time of day, you'll either see the owner working, his family, or your typical high school kids.\\n\\nI've always enjoyed their subs, whether it was as a young child or on lunch break long ago in high school. What I enjoy most is their meat selection and the fact that they have a generous helping of not too tart italian dressing and mayo on their subs. The combination is hard to describe but when it's done right, it tastes unlike any other sub.Their bread is soft and fluffy and they leave out the million and a half vegetables you'll get at other places, making it a true sandwich- not just a bunch of vegetables on bread. You can get your sandwich hot or cold and they have reasonably priced lunch specials btwn. 10 AM - 2 PM where you can get an 8 or 12 inch sub, drink, chips or pickle for between $4.63 - $5.23  They also do catering.\\n\\nPersonally I think the Poorboy is one of the best with Salami, Spiced Ham, Bologna,  and  Provolone Cheese. I would never think of putting those meats together, let alone eat them by themselves, but for some reason they make it work. I love Krazy Sub :)\n"

Located in charming downtown Glendale only two miles from home, we went there on a Saturday night.  There is a generous patio with lovely twinkle lights, and you can hear the music from the coffee shop across the street.  The interior is bright and cheerful, with, I think, 3 rooms.\\n\\nThe place was almost full - always a good sign, and a very friendly waiter seated us and took our drink orders.  The menu is generous, and the prices reasonable.  We shared spring rolls and potstickers.  Best spring roll ever, methinks: not too much lettuce as filler, delish pork and shrimp that tastes like it once swam, with a light peanut sauce that does not overwhelm.  The potstickers were also great - generously filled with tasty pork and veggies, complimented by a mild Asian BBQ sauce.  We were off to a good start.\\n\\nHubs, who is new to Vietnamese cuisine, and who gets props for trying, chose a pan fried rice noodle dish with meat (at least chicken and shrimp) and veggies.  He thoroughly enjoyed it, generously offering me one bite, and pretending not to notice when I stole a couple more.\\n\\n Just as my bench-mark dish for rating Thai restaurants is Pad Thai, my dish for Vietnamese food is Bun Thit Nuong (or Bun Thit Heo Nuong here).  My bowl had all the right stuff: tender, flavorful grilled pork (not a speck of gristle - a first in Phoenix!), lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, and julienned cukes, vermicelli and sauce.  I love the sweet, vinegary sauce that comes with Bun Thit Nuong, and my sweet server told me the ingredients.  It was simply so very good.\\n\\nLittle Saigon has the whole package:  clean, cute, friendly and attentive service, and excellent food.  We can\'t wait to go back and try some of the other things on the menu, and mentioned in Yelp reviews.  Can you say \\Yum, yum\\"""", Dum Dum?"""""""\n'

Anyway, this was the first time we made it out to Sochu house. The place reminds me of a club turned restaurant...the decor is very dance club. We sat in the dining room, but the bar looked a bit cooler. At the suggestion of our (awesome) server, we had mostly tapas. We started with the potstickers, which we both thought were just ok. Then we got the orange puffs...very good. Lightly fried chicken with a sweet and spicy orange sauce over some tasty cabbage slaw. We then had the soup dumplings....Oh. Em. Gee. These were awesome! I haven't found dumplings like this anywhere else in Phoenix. They are salty and savory and delicious. So good, we ordered a second plate. We finished up with the red curry. This is supposedly the spiciest thing on the menu, but I didn't find it that spicy. It really was kind of a just okay curry. Could have been a tad bit thicker and had a little more flavor. I would definitely come back, however, for those delicious soup dumplings....I have actually been thinking about them all day. Also, they have some great specials like any 4 tapas for 20$ on Tuesdays and date night specials on Thursdays....Definitely will be back.\n"

Kiltlifter is my #1 favorite beer of all time.  I've tried them all and they are all very competitive but Kiltlifter takes the cake.\\n\\nOnto the foodies.  Without a doubt, any burger on the menu is going to be monstrous and delightful.  Mushroom and Swiss is my backup but I've recently fallen in love with the Jalapeno burger.  It's cream cheese, roasted jalapenos (not spicy) and onion straws.  For $9 you can't beat it.  I really haven't strayed away from my favorites (I tend to stick with what I love) but anything anyone has ordered on the menu, there has never been a complaint.\\n\\nWithout a doubt, if you are just visiting for a day or two in Tempe or Scottsdale, this is the place you want to go for lunch or dinner.

aS"Nobuo combines unique, delectable dishes with an intimate, historic atmosphere. The setting is an old turn-of-the-century wooden house called the Teeter House. It's small, but there's darkness and mystery added to the atmosphere. The izakaya style of dining means that the dishes are tapas and are meant to be shared between those in your dining party. The experience at Nobuo is unlike any other dining experience I've ever had. The fact that it was a flawless experience with an atypical meal in an atypical setting makes me happy to award Nobuo with 5 stars.\\n\\nI had late reservations at 9PM and wandered through Heritage Square to get to the Teeter House. I love the fact that the area is surrounded by historic houses built over a century ago. I love going to places with history, which is probably why I love New York and Boston so much. Heritage Square in Downtown Phoenix has converted historic houses into popular eateries. Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we waited outside on some comfy seats on the porch. To be honest, I wouldn't have minded eating our dinner out on the porch looking out into the square, but the tables and rooms inside enhance your experience here at Nobuo. When our table was ready, they came out to get us and they sat us inside right next to the front door with a window to the porch where we were just sitting. Since the restaurant is in a house, there were different rooms that diners could be seated in. The house had the one original restroom, which had a large sink and a new toilet that I'm sure isn't from the 1800's. \\n\\nOur server was friendly and explained to us about the style of dining, izakaya, and that two people typically order 6 dishes. When we finally decided on what we wanted to order, we went with the following dishes:\\n\\n-Kimchi ($6) - By no means was this traditional kimchi... it was even better! More like a salad than anything, but the taste was similar to kimchi. I think the sesame oil made the taste of traditional kimchi less intense, but at the same time even more delicious.\\n\\n-Grapefruit  and  Hamachi ($14) - An interesting combination of sashimi, grapefruit, and avocado on four separate spoons. The white truffle ponzu oil and grapefruit gave this tasty treat its' bite. Our server told us that the dish was meant to eaten by the spoonful, as in, taken in one bite. The combination was so delicious that I wish they gave us more than four spoons.\\n\\n-Yellowtail Ceviche ($14) - Boy, I feel dumb actually thinking that they would give us traditional ceviche. This dish was much like the Grapefruit  and  Hamachi in the way they were meant to be eaten. Four separate spoons with yellowtail, myouga, sesame seed, with shredded taro on top. It was amazingly exquisite and I can't even tell you whether the yellowtail ceviche or grapefruit  and  hamachi was better. They were both put together so well, each of them had their own creative and unique taste.\\n\\n-Seabass  and  Mushroom ($14) - It came steamed in a neat little paper boat. The seabass was steamed to perfection and was surrounded by enoki mushrooms (I think) in a sake soy sauce. The seabass was good, but the mushrooms in the sake soy sauce made the dish even better.\\n\\n-Pork Belly Wrapped in Banana Leaf ($14) - The Pork Belly and Rice came out baked inside the banana leaf. The rice was sticky and had a great flavor to it. It was the typical white rice and the pork belly wasn't typical either. It was good, but this wasn't my favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nI must say that Nobuo is an experience I'll remember for a long time. I can't even remember that last time I was completely blown away by cuisine and atmosphere. The dishes are pricey, but expect to get a wonderful experience of divine cuisine with an unbeatable ambiance. If you're ever in Phoenix, you must try Nobuo at Teeter House.\n"

aS"Good food at good prices. This place has been our favorite local Greek food restaurant for a few years now. It has recently changed management. I've been here twice since the change and the chicken pita seems about the same. The previous management was good, but it appears to still be family-run and the service is still great. I wouldn't be surprised to find out the new owners were previous customers that liked it the way it was. They have only made a few minor changes here and I think they are improvements (i.e., real plates and silverware). Give them a try. We want to keep them in business!\n"

aS"Five stars for a fast food place? Hell yea. This is pretty much the only fast food place (other than In-N-Out) that people actually like instead of eating at strictly for convenience. (That said, it's still fast food.)\\nYou can either drive thru, order in your car, or eat outside on picnic style tables. The kids meals make for a great snack (who doesn't like a free toy?) and the coneys are ahead of their time as far as AZ is concerned.\\nThe real killer, of course, is the huge variety of drinks, slushies, etc. If you go during happy hour you can get a whole crowd of people large drinks for just a couple of bucks.\\nDon't go expecting fantastic food, but do go in lieu of just about any other fast food place.\n"

Flavor was good, ingredients and style were all appropriate for the weather. The roasted chicken was my next course and  thought this was great too. Overall, excellent food until I tried the boy\'s calamari- not so much. I know many people appreciate large portions but the law of diminishing returns applies to one\'s appetite as well. The calamari was large, deep fried and piled high. Bloated and uncomfortable after consuming large quantities of fried food, he wasn\'t even slightly hungry after he finished the first course. Now, I know, he could have stopped eating the on his own. I agree. he made a personal choice to eat the fried but I think there has to be some portion planning on the chef\'s part as well or at least a warning \\""""Caution: you will not be interested in any other food item after consumption of the calamari\\"""". Needless to say he was not impressed at all with his second course, the hanger steak. \\n\\nWine: lots of options- very pleased."""""""\n'

aS"So you think you have no need for a professional portrait eh? I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer. Please try again. \\n\\nOne day I was out at a local event being overly ridiculous and crazy as usual. Tyson was there and taking a few shots here and there. The next thing I know there's a candid of me from the event where I am obviously finding something extremely hilarious because I am crazy laughing. It was such a fantastic candid that it made me want to have my picture taken and see what other magic could happen. I started thinking about not only professional photos to put in various bio pages and what not, but a photo shoot for the fun of it. I hadn't had one since my senior pictures. \\n\\nThe first shoot was pretty good. Something was missing though. It could have been that I gave Tyson some really ridiculous words, and it could've been that I wasn't having the best of days. Either way, Tyson recognized this and asked if minded if we gave it another try. How courteous and amazing is that? This alone is enough to give it 5 stars, but it only gets better. \\n\\nI think both of us came into the shoot better prepared. He realized I really was that crazy and I was having a much better day. I had talked with him a few times before the second shoot and could see how much he had been thinking about ways to improve and to really capture me. The second shoot was amazing. There were balloons, rainbows, hearts, it was truly a masterpiece.\\n\\nThe soft edit process is truly incredible. It allowed me to see how others view me and what draws their attention first. It also made me very excited about the shoot all over again. I finally ended up choosing three as I couldn't possible just stick to one. One of them is my yelp avatar and the other two you can see on my blog or floating around the internets.\\n\\ni cannot thank Tyson enough for not only inviting me back for another session but finding a great way to capture me, my personality, and what I was ultimately looking for. He truly nailed it on the spot. The shoot was so genuine, so real. Being able to play with balloons and have a decent conversation completely distracted me from the shoot and it ended up just being me, and that's what worked. I would recommend him in a heartbeat. It's not often you see someone so passionate and excited about their work as I experienced this entire time with Tyson. I also have to admit, I don't think I've ever looked this good.\\n\\nIt is now that I truly realize why professional portraits are a necessity. Go get some.\n"

The beef is seasoned well and the dish itself, at least for the burrito, looks very appetizing (the tacos come out wrapped in foil).

aS"The Auld Dubliner is a welcome change in the chanification that is the West Valley.  They do have a few other locations (one in Tucson, another in Colorado) but this place doesn't have that chain style feel.

I've never been so I can't speak to that, but the interior is eclectic and fun.\\n\\nThe people that work at the Dubliner were friendly.  Full disclosure, I went here to see a friend who works there as a server and had her schedule time wrong.  The staff was super friendly and still got us what we needed, knowing full well that she would be getting any tips from our table.  \\n\\nThey have an 'early bird special which gives you an option of the Irish fare in smaller portions for a smaller price.  You get a choice of soup or salad and a small dessert with this option, all for $9.95.  A pretty decent deal for all the food you get.\\n\\nI had the fish and chips early bird special, pretty much the only thing that sounded half appetizing to me.  Irish food is typically quite meaty, so options are always limited at such institutions for me.  They also have Hooegarden on tap which pushed them to the four star rating for me.\n"

The service is consistently friendly, attentive, and happy to offer menu suggestions.  \\n\\nI can't comment on their wide variety of main dishes (which all look appetizing), because I can never tear myself away from the pizza.  What goes great with that pizza?  The Antipasto salad is fantastic - loaded with meats, cheese and even my favorite artichoke hearts.  A small is more than ample for two people to share.  Save some of that Italian dressing (presented on the side) to use as a dipping sauce for your pizza crust.  Instant breadsticks!  Speaking of pizza, Red Devil's graces a thin yet doughy crust with tangy sauce and generous evenly-distributed toppings.  My favorite, pepperoni and mushroom, tastes wonderful when re-heated for lunch the next day too!\\n\\nGo, sit in one of the bar's padded booths.

The menu might look giant, but all the dishes are just slight variations of each other.  If you had broken rice with about 11 different things you can get on it... just imagine the different variations of menu items you can write.  \\n\\nMy dad had the bi suon ta hu ky which is shredded pork, pork chop, and a tofu skin wrap filled with shrimp.  He really liked it and said it reminded him of something that he would get in northern cali.\\n\\nMy mom and I ordered dishes that are really hard to find at other restaurants.  She had these little rice vermicelli pattie noodles with some pork and a fish sauce topping.  She said the vermicelli was a little dry, but the pork was really good.\\n\\nI had the banh canh which is an udon like noodle in a  a light pork broth.  The broth was really good.  I think it's better than the one next door (unphogettable).  If you look at the broth, it's crystal clear which is something that's hard to do.  \\n\\nPricing is really fair with around 7.99 a dish that would have anyone walking away really full.\\n\\nI give it only 4 stars, because the tea situation really weirds me out.  They pour tea in a tall glass that would be used for water.  The glass was really hot, and it cooled down really quickly.  My mom even asked if they had a pot of tea, and they said no.  She said a pot of tea would stay warm longer and taste a lot better.\\n\\nOverall I would definitely come here and eat anytime while I'm grocery shopping.

The wine we ordered was named after someone very near and dear to my heart so of course we ordered it and it was middle of the road. Nothing terrible but nothing special. Then we started with the wings. The flavor was delicious but the execution seemed like they were boiled or something. Too soft for the way wings should be. No big though, just took them home. Then pizza was yummy! I was truly impressed with the crust! It was cooked to the ideal crispness and softness that a deep dish should be. The flavor profile was fantastic! I worked in a kitchen making pizza for a while so I know what is good. The cheese was stringy and hot like it should be and there were plenty of thinky sliced pepperoni just the way I like it. I'm not so sure the staff cares as much as the cooks but I enjoyed my time there.\n"

Another lady greeted us and took us to our table.  A gentleman brought us hot tea and cold water to our table right away, and then we were greeted by our waitress Rose.  Good team work going on at this place.  \\n\\nI have never been to a nice Chinese place before.  This was a really nice one and I was super excited to see how the food would taste.  While enjoying my hot tea (BEST TEA EVER!  it was PERFECT), I glanced over the menu.  The prices are very decent and they have many different dishes to choose from.  \\n\\nWe started with an order of fried wantons.  These were light, airy, slightly crispy, delicate and filled with a little bit of cream cheese.  They came with sweet and sour sauce, which was the best sweet and sour sauce I've ever had.  Nice bright red orange color, sweet and tangy and not thick or to thin, just right.  Very good start to a grand meal that I had no idea was about to come.\\n\\nRose moved our fried wantons' plate out of the way and put two large plates in front of us.  She then started bringing out our food.  We had sweet and sour pork, pan fried noodles, fried rice, and sesame chicken.  Sesame chicken was at least two large oh so TENDER chicken breasts crisped to perfection in thick dark onion sauce that I soaked my rice and noodles in.  Pan fried noodles were lightly oiled and tasted like they were fried in a wok, very tasty.  The fried rice was fresh, soft and fluffy.  The sweet and sour pork was smothered (NOT soggy) in their yummy sweet and sour sauce.  It included large chunks of pineapples, green bell peppers and onions.\\n\\nEvery portion was enough for two to three people to share or even save for the next day (see photos), BUT it is going to be so hard from stopping yourself enjoying your hot fresh food in such a romantic dark setting (music overhead was a love song station).  \\n\\nWe had so much to pack up, Rose came by and put it all up for us in boxes.  She was awesome, very sweet, and always came by to check on us to see how we were doing.  \\n\\nFor everything we got -not- including tip was ONLY $34.  Forget the buffets, this is the place to go.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place for large groups, couples, events, and anyone else who loves Chinese Food.  It's the BEST I EVER HAD!\n"

It was recommended by a friend and since they just opened a 2nd location across the street from where I reside I figured I had no excuse, plus I had just watched a Travel Channel special on the Best BBQ Spots across the country, so I was definitely in the mood.\\nI ordered their Lunch Special #1, choice of sandwich, (I chose the Beef Brisket), choice of side (Sweet Fries) and a fountain drink for about $9. It was very tasty, their bbq sauce is unlike anything I have ever tasted, (sweet and smoky) I knew as soon as I finished my first bite that it was a flavor that I would find myself craving in the future. The sweet fries were also very good. \\nMy only knock on the food was the bun that the sandwich was served on, basically a regular sesame seed hamburger bun, It cheapened the sandwich in my opinion, which is a shame because it was soooo good. I'll definitely be back for 2nds and 3rds but would love to get my sandwich on a higher quality bun. Good Luck w/ the new location!!\n"

aS"I read all the reviews are they are not good, so why do I like this place? It's old fashioned, the service was great - just nice and polite. It takes a bit longer to get your food (it's a good thing). Open kitchen. The burger was super messy in a yummy way. The meat was not a perfect flat circle it actually seemed like real beef. I drank a full sugar cherry coke and it was worth every calorie. I got the skinny fries, not because I thought they had less calories but I like skinny stick fries that are crispy and they were. \\nI got a medium fatburger with cheese  and  grilled onions, medium skinny fries, drink, the kid got: small fatburger with cheese, fat fries and milk shake. It came to a little over $20. \\nThe only thing that would improve is beer. The only negative is a bit too salty but that might be why it was so good too.\n"

I have only been here for evening dinners and drinks, but I can tell you that it is a great venue for a special occasion.  I took my lovely lady here for a birthday and for an anniversary, so I pretty much played this out. However, you can still go!!!\\n\\nIf you are a fan of Prime Rib, you have GOT to try the Compass Room\'s version.  It is cooked in a Merlot which makes it taste uber-fancy and your significant other will want to strip you down right there and thank you properly. For desert, try the Tiramasu.  It has thick chocolate walls printed with the signature \'Compass Room\' and will put everyone in the mood for a party!\\n\\nThe price is pretty high.  Like Amy said, about $80 per head. But definitely worth it.\\n\\nFor this, I believe the Compass Room\'s logo should be \\Sit, Spin, Go Home and Get Some\\""""\\n\\nDo it. Do it."""""""\n'

Wall to wall people- almost uncomfortably so- and they all look like they've just stepped out of a salon or Gucci. Come 5pm, Sapporo turns into a big, well-dressed meat market. \\nBut if you actually do make it to the dining area or a cooking table, the food is fantastic.

There is a wide variety of beautiful China tea cups, pots and teas for sale as well as many other items to compliment a formal tea at your home.\\n\\nWhen you enter and are seated, you will find beautifully laid tables.  The table is laid out for a formal tea.   They offer everything from fresh, out of the oven scones to the traditional tiered plate offerings of finger sandwiches, cheese and fruit.  If you are wanting something more substantial, I would recommend their bread pudding (to die for!) or their beautiful Waldorf salad.  The food is very fresh, prepared well, and presented well.   The selections of tea are vast and they also offer a tea of the day just to keep the variety going.\\n\\nWhile there, you are offered to \\dress up\\"""" if you so desire.  A darling array of Boas and Hats are offered to guests to use while dinning.  They are great for pictures and make a special event all the more festive.\\n\\nBesides the ambiance, the food is always of excellent quality.  Fresh, and the best of everything is used.  Please save room for dessert!  You won\'t want to miss their traditional English offerings.\\n\\nMy only complaint with the place is that the tables, chairs, and room are small.  There isn\'t much room to move, and the tables are packed together pretty tight.  If you are any bigger than 5\'2\\"""" and 100 lbs, you will be uncomfortable in their chairs.  Very small and not good on the back.

There are so many good Mexican places here that knowing which one(s) to visit can be a bit overwhelming, so I rely on the locals to give me tips.\\n\\nMy sisters have lived in AZ since 1995 and this is one of their fave Mexican places in the West Valley. One thing I must comment on is their salsa. I LOVE THE SALSA AT MANUEL'S. I'm a fiend for good salsas and Manuel's has some of the best around, in my opinion. The food is fresh, decent Mexican, though pretty Americanized by my standards. It's served by friendly people. Gets busy here on weekend nights but definitely worth a visit.\n"

aS"Packed back behind other shops in Old Town Scottsdale, this is a place easily missed but should never be neglected.  The sandwiches offered are both traditional and out of the ordinary.  With a kitchen taking up half the real estate, expect to get friendly with other customers as seating is at a premium in this place.  \\n\\nThe Reuben is a must for the first-timer, spot-on and delicious with every bite, best enjoyed with a locally brewed on-tap root beer.  I personally recommend the brie-and-pickle with sliced turkey, quite possibly the most delicous sandwich I've ever had from a deli-style restaurant, and equally enjoyed with a frosty on-tap cream soda.\\n\\nSamples of both the root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda and apple cider are available and all very good.  I wasn't as much a fan of the cide as the rest of the choices, it tasted like a slightly fizzy Martinelli's apple juice.  They also offer all the choices in float form and with exotic syrups such as prickly pear.\\n\\nA great place to visit in the neighborhood to get a taste of revisiting childhood and a past era.\n"

aS"I just moved to Phoenix and found these therapists online. I went in to see Trina this weekend and was so impressed I had to make sure to add them to Yelp as soon as possible. \\n\\nI chose Rustic Sage because I have always had good luck with massage therapists who work at places that only do massage. When I lived in Chicago, I went to Urban Oasis, when I lived in Boston, I went to Inman Oasis (not affiliated) and here in Phoenix, my choice is Rustic Sage. These women are exclusively there to work on your body in a serious way. This is not a salon or even a beauty spa kind of place. Instead, it's about healing yourself physically and mindfully. Trina, my therapist, genuinely wanted to help me feel good so I can maintain peace of mind. \\n\\nIf you're the kind of person who is looking for someone to help you figure out why your back hurts or what the source of that knot in your shoulder is, this is a great place to go. I have been seeing massage therapists for a long time and never received the kind of treatment before that I got from Trina. She helped me work out the pain in my hips and my IT band and afterwards even showed me some exercises to do in-between appointments. \\n\\nI also like this place because it's not *too* Zen. I like the nature theme and the peaceful lighting but it's not cluttered or too homey. It's clean, modern, and when I visited I immediately felt calm and quiet. \\n\\nTrina and Wendy told me that they're moving to a new space (the Fifth Avenue Downtown Scottsdale address) on September 11. They're having a grand opening and will soon have more therapists; they'll add yoga classes as well. As I left my appointment I met the yoga instructor, who was coming in to see Trina for a massage. She told me about the classes and seems like a truly smart, kind, down-to-earth person to take a class from. I'm definitely signing up. \\n\\nHaving just moved here I can't believe how lucky I am to have found this place! Very highly recommended.\n"

As we ate, we watched a beautiful sunset over the lake, and also saw a few homeowners guide their boats up to the restaurant's small dock. \\nEverything was delicious, from the hot crab and artichoke dip through the entrees to the dessert. I like to try something new, so I ordered salmon tacos with mango salsa and chipotle mayo, My husband is more traditional, so he had the Torpedo -- a man-sized prime rib sandwich with plenty of tender meat. I was tempted by the brie quesdadilla with candied walnuts, and my husband wants to go back for the Southwest pizza. \\nAnd for dessert? Get this -- they bring a hibachi to your table so that you can roast marshmallows, dip them in a pot of melted chocolate, then roll them in graham cracker crumbs! Unfortunately, we didn't have time for that luxurious experience as we were on our way to an event, so we got the New York cheesecake with berries to go. \\nAround the bar, the crowd was young, with some middle-aged people, and a couple of seniors. But they all were having fun, which made the mood of this small place happy and lively. \\nThe place is owned by a husband/wife catering team, so the menu may change with the seasons.\n"

I have yet to really question their staff on their products, so I cannot speak to their knowledge, but my guess would be that Sportsman's knowledge will still be superior.  The price point at Total wine is absolutely amazing.  It is obvious that they are not marking up their product as much as the other stores are forced to.  They aren't simply taking the money from the consumer, but are passing savings along to the customer.  Great to hear.  I look forward to many purchases at this establishment.\n"

We were expecting it to be in peanut sauce but was far from it. We wont be getting that again but we also paired it with Chicken Fried Rice which was a whopping 5 dollars.

aS"Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.\n"

We arrived at our designated reservation time of 7:00 PM but the restaurant was not very full. It is a beautiful place with one of the best views in the valley. It's modern and classy at the same time. Very comfortable atmosphere. My husband had a beautiful floral arrangement waiting at the table for me. We started off by ordering two of their specialty drinks. The Ginger Margarita ($12) and a special Kumquat Mojito. Both were very good. We were informed by the General Manager on a table visit that the Ginger Margaritas are the only drink that is in all of Jean-Georges restaurants worldwide. I ordered the tasting menu for $58.00, which gives you smaller portions of the following food items: Tuna Tartare with Avocado, Sweet Corn Ravioli in basil butter, Halibut with Miso Yuza glaze and Bok-Choy, Grilled petite filet with J  and  G steak sauce, sauteed spinach, french fries, warm chocolate cake with Carmel ice cream. My husband ordered the Porterhouse $60.00 with a side of mushrooms. They did give us a complimentary dessert of cheesecake with cherry compote and sour cherry sorbet. My husband enjoyed his steak even though he had to send it back to be recooked. My steak was also undercooked but I ended up taking it home so I did not send it back. The steak was not served sizzling hot and the glaze on the Halibut was very spicy. Service was average nothing to rave about. They did make an exception and let me order the tasting menu as I was informed by the server this menu is usually reserved if everyone at the table orders it. I think they wanted to make our anniversary special. I've had better steaks but I gave them four stars since they did go out of there way to make our evening special and the view is fantastic!\n"

I've tried their grilled cheese sandwich and bread pudding which were remarkable, and they have great beers on tap, so I know I will probably make this place a more regular stop, as it is directly on my way home from work, and I can forgive the initial oversight in my first review.\\n\\nA great place to chill from the summer heat!\n"

aS"First Watch is a favorite of ours for breakfast but they also do a nice lunch too.   Get there early if you are going on the weekend, this place gets busy but they seem to turn tables rather quickly.\\n\\nLunch time, especially later, is generally quiet and relaxed.  Good time to dine alone if you are inclined.\\n\\nTurkey dill crepe is one of my all-time favorites - fresh mushrooms  and  spinach make me smile.   I like my potatoes and toast/muffin well done and they always get it right.  Also extra-crispy bacon - a side order is 4 slices - share w/ your friends but don't pass it up.  I also like their skillet breakfasts but you'd better be really hungry because these guys are big.  Did I mention french toast  and  waffles?  Yes, they are also really good.\\n\\nIf you're a fan, join their free SunE-Club.  They'll email you coupons occasionally and a free meal on your b-day.  Now that's something to smile about!\n"

aS"Listen.....this ain't your average Mexican food restaurant. No Spanish rice and refried beans here! As the website states, its neuvo Mexican (with a bit of Cuban flare and culinary influence in my opinion). Oh, speaking of website. Theirs is just as enticing as the food. It's like a music video with a menu. It's sexy and food photography is amazing.  Check it out! \\n\\nI started with guacamole and salsa. Yum! The red Sangria was one of the best I've had in a long time. Not overly sweet with a nice kick! The (vegetarian) chile relleno was amazing! Stuffed with roasted zucchini,  onions and potatoes. The perfectly spicy ancho chilie was nicely contrasted with the sweetness of the veggies inside. \\n\\nMy only complaint was that I had to ask my server for a fresh order of corn pudding b/c it was over done.  If you're familiar from Southern corn pudding, its not really like that. Theirs is thin and more dense like corn bread. But very delish! \\n\\nAll the food was great and the atmosphere was rather unexpected for a restaurant in Tempe Marketplace. I was transported to another place. Refreshing. \\n\\nBon Appetite!\n"

aS"Decided to go to Beckett's Table because of Yelp's reviews.  It was exactly as described.  We had to try the cheddar bacon biscuits and glad we did.  They were flaky, tasty and no butter needed.  And yes, we did the macaroni and cheese as well.  Listen, if were going to Beckett's table we were going to try it all!  The mac  and  cheese was a unique blend but it worked.  We also had the short rib dish.  The meat just fell apart.  The yukon mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious.  We may have overdone it but it was well worth it.  Plenty more to try next time.  Oh, and try an Arnold Palmer...mmm mmm!  Cool ambiance too!  Beautiful presentation  and  great service.  A nice surprise for the location.  Great place, give it a try!\n"

aS"I stopped over at Lone Star for a quick lunch yesterday. The food was brought out very quickly after I told our server I was pressed for time. The Pork Chop was juicy and very tasty; I could have wolfed down another Pork Chop (it was that good). The gigantic Sweet Potato was delicious when coupled with a little bit of butter and cinnamon. I love their salads, but didn't have a chance to order one since I was in a hurry. The drinks are refilled on a timely basis. Lunch for two was about $22 before tip.\n"

A group of friends and I all sprung for the daily special of scrambled eggs incorporated with hot links, white cheese, and peppers paired with delicious home fries.

We found this place off the beaten path near the Legacy Resort and Spa where we stayed last night and if you're ever in the Tempe area, this is definitely a nice five star place prepped to impress...  and the help is HOT.  \\n\\nIt's a wine bar and restaurant that is set up in a beautiful converted home space that still has it's homeyness intact to the tea!  Good wine, but for a wine bar, a little sparing...  We had fun!   There was live music, great lighting, did I mention the hot waiter?, and an overall nice atmosphere (ie, hot waiter)!    The menu looked spectacular, but as you've probably figured out by  now, I was there for the vino and the view.\n"

aS"Solo Cafe is definitely one of the premier coffeehouses in the Phoenix area. They make excellent coffee drinks from Ron Cortez-roasted beans and all of their tea and pastries are from local businesses as well.\\n\\nThe ambiance at Solo can best be described as upscale eclectic. It definitely isn't pretentious, but it isn't the typical bohemian coffeehouse feel. The owners of Solo just completed a minor facelift of the shop, changing out some of the art and rearranging the interior. On the back wall, they added a large mural which features the Solo Cafe name. Also, they're in the process of adding a kitchen so that they can offer a wider selection of food, which I think will serve to make this awesome coffeehouse even better.\\n\\nSolo Cafe is a gem among the Phoenix coffee scene and it's great to see a local business thriving.\n"

aS'I frequent this place at least once a week to enjoy the wonderful affordable AND low cal fro yo at Golden Spoon. I LOVE this place. They have all the standard toppings and even carry seasonal flavors like Pumpkin (my personal favorite). The fro yo does come out soft, so I sometimes take it home and freeze it so it gets icey. All this considered, it still deserves five stars. \\n\\nHow can it be that we live in the scorching hot desert and there is only a handful of fro yo possibilities in the area? Of all the strip malls full of nail spas, tanning salons and every random franchised experience under the sun, why are there only a few jumping on the fro yo lovin train?\n'

We had a pretty serious collection of empty glasses goin on.  The pork hash was delicious.  Eggs came out a little less runny than I would like and they rushed back to grab me some new ones without making me feel like a d-bag.  Hula's is quickly becoming a regular spot for me.\n"

aS"Stayed here on a business trip Mon 7/11 thru Thurs 7/14 and my experience was great! I researched other reviews before I decided on staying at this hotel since it appeared to be a party spot on the weekends. I called to make my reservation (instead of on line) and was assured that it would be quiet during the week. During the first night I heard a few people talking next door but not too late, other than that it was nice and peaceful the entire stay. I had a standard room and it was huge, decorated beautifully and I love the decor. Was looking for a different hotel with some character and this one definitely did not disappoint! I liked that every room has a balcony and a nice comfy lounge chair to enjoy outside. The mini bar was fully stocked. Beds were really comfy, and plenty of space for me to do work in the evenings. My only complaint (which was minor) was that I had a view of the empty dirt lot across the street which wasn't very pretty. It seemed like there weren't very many people staying at the hotel and I would have liked a room with courtyard view but by the time I got settled in my room, didn't feel like being moved. The bar and lounge area is comfy and there were lots of business travelers so it was a great environment. Ate dinner at the bar one night while I watched the baseball all star game on one of the flat screen tv's and food was really good. Service was excellent and staff really friendly. Valets were quick and service was excellent. I never had to wait for than 5 minutes for my car. My only regret is that I didn't have time to use the workout center but looked like nice equipment and it overlooked the pool through big glass windows. Location was excellent for me, it's within minutes of the 101 freeway. \\n\\nOverall great experience and I am planning to come back to this hotel on vacation with my husband. This is my spot to stay for all my business trips to AZ!\n"

aS"I give this place 5-stars because not because of yummy food, but because of their CHEESECAKE! But I'll get to that later.\\n\\nTHE FIRST VISIT: After skimming through a friends photo album on Facebook, I saw that they ate here and I decided to give it a try! I went on a Wednesday afternoon with my boyfriend for some early lunching! \\nI ordered the Linguine Frutti de Mare, its light and hits the spot for pasta and seafood! There are like a gazillion baby clams in that dish I swear.\\nMy boyfriend ordered a ton of stuff but I don't remember... He throughly enjoyed his meal and said it was the best Italian food outside his mother's cooking! (He also mentioned that he'd never eat at Olive Garden after coming here.)\\n\\nEven after we were pretty much stuffed and ready to be wheeled out by our soft spoken and chipper waitress, we had to try the cheesecake, because I love cheesecake.\\n\\nIt arrived, and the first spoonful of the stuff was heavenly, it was rich and almost heavy, but it just ... Melts in your mouth, that it doesn't matter that you're probably gonna weigh six thousand pounds after the meal. It had roasted hazelnuts and raspberry sauce slathered all over it, oh god, I'm probably going to have to go tomorrow... And order TWO slices of cheesecake. Haha!\\n\\nMy first time here was amazing, our waitress was very attentive and humorous. The second time wasn't so awesome, but I'll cut the waiter that we got some slack because it got really busy really fast compared to the quiet lunch I had the first time. The second time our drinks were empty almost 75% of the time and that's no bueno in my book.\\n\\nThe only reason I will come back is for the cheesecake. I hope that stays consistent.\n"

aS"d'lish is for sure the perfect name for this little place. When you walk in, the atmosphere is great, what with the snazzy furniture, friendly staff, and the plenty of customers in line, eager for the fresh food they serve up. Their menu is expansive and you might feel overwhelmed by all the breakfasts, soups, salads, wraps, sandwiches, are you feeling overwhelmed as I talk about all the choices that will overwhelm you?! Last time I went there, I ordered the nuts n' berries salad, the perfect toss of greens, blueberries, goat cheese, candied walnuts, and a raspberry walnut vinaigrette. It's perfect! I've also had their butternut squash soup, YUM! I try to try something different all the places I eat, and at D'lish, it'll be a while till I run out of new options. Go here!!\n"

But then again, an extra shot is only $.25 so it's not a big deal.  \\n\\nIf you are trying to avoid caffeine, their Italian/French Soda is yummy too! Love to mix the strawberry and vanilla + cream. Add some whip cream and hmmm...heavenly (so healthy too...LOL)!\n"

aS'"""My man had a wild hair to go here tonight and so we went. We both ordered top sirloin, but his came with a bleu cheese butter sauce on top. Mine came with no toppings, and the waitress didn\'t offer steak sauce. Hmm. Since I like my steak well done, one would surmise that I would probably want something to dip it in or pour over it, n\'est-ce pas? But no. We waited for her to come back, he asked her for steak sauce and she comes back and puts it on HIS side of the table. You know, the side with the steak that already has a topping. Uhduh? \\n\\nAlso, I ordered my steak well done and it was perfect, albeit DRY as there was no sauce and I almost choked on it. But he ordered his medium, and it came out with no pink. Huh?\\n\\nAll in all, a good deal for the dinners which were around $16 each. Good calamari app. Nom nom. The wine I chose was delicious - a blend, they\'re usually better. The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy too. This is the 2nd time we\'ve dined here since moving to Phoenix and I still give it a thumbs up. The first time I enjoyed the \\Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad\\"""" and highly recommend it if you\'re into that kind of dish. But if you order steak, be careful to order it less done than you really want it. I probably could\'ve played hockey or maybe football with mine. Good gracious.\\n\\nNo other snafu\'s tonight, except that the tables outside were a bit too close and as the large party next to us was being seated, my boyfriend had a bunch of butts in his face. Back that ass up, ladies....actually, WE had to push our table away twice. And later a waiter was trying to carry like a million plates away from a table and of course he dropped them and scared us, giving us a few more grey hairs (thanks a lot). This stuff happens and it\'s like eh, whatever, who cares. But these details do kind of dampen the ambiance. \\n\\nReally love the large selection of everything!

aS"They are everything and more of what you expect from a local, neighborhood breakfast/lunch cafe.  They don't pretend to be something they're not.  There's no hype, just some odd decor, good seating (mostly booths),  good food and friendly service.    \\n\\nWe meet our friends here for breakfast almost every weekend.  Is it the best breakfast I've ever had? No, but it's always exactly what we order.  The pancakes are great.  The coffee is good and always flowing.  The eggs always come out perfectly cooked.  The egg salad sandwich is a winner.  Friend typically gets a salad and it looks nice and fresh.  There's nothing that really stands out but stick with the basics and you're good to go.  \\n\\nWe're never rushed out of our booth even though we stay a little bit longer than we should.

aS"Very, very hip, trendy place to hang out.  They have it all here. Great place for families and hipsters alike.  The shopping looks really cool with vintage clothing galore.  The PF Flyers were especially interesting.  Tried the famliy pack of Sliders, Brisket, Sausage, Meatball and Tuna. They also have Egg and Chicken I think.  Also tried the Apple Fritter desert.  Very good.  The night I went was the first night they tried music.  it seemed to go over well and the owner, Steve told me they plan to have more music acts in the coming months. \\n\\nSince I mentioned Steve, the owner, Let's go ahead and mention the staff.  The second I walked into the place I was greeted by an employee.  Welcomed and given the nickel tour.  The Staff at the bar and the trailer-kitchen (More about that in a min) were very friendly.  \\n\\nThe creative use of the space was so interesting. Its one of those places that the first time you are there you just sit and look around the space.  Vintage records hang from the wall, An authentic Hamm's Bear beer statue. Original Brick walls and exposed building trusses. \\n\\nNow to the vintage Airstream travel trailer.  They use it as an outdoor kitchen. You order your food from a picnic table and they make it in the trailer/kitchen.  Very Cleaver.  \\n\\nFor me, the best part was the vintage cocktails. I have been reading a lot about the trend to recreate old style cocktails that for one reason or another are not made anymore. Drinks like the old-fashion, the Cuba Libre, or Rusty Nail.  I could go on about the authentic soda fountain, the bakery and ice cream if I had more time. I will just say go to the Duce and see for yourself \\n\\nOne slight bummer is the prices.  Slightly expensive. $8 bucks for 3 sliders.  $10 for a desert that was pretty small.  Cocktails are all $10 and above. They seem to try to offer some inexpensive alternatives $3 for PBR's and Hamm's beer.  That may be a fun novelty but the reason those beers are nearly defunct is because they suck. I guess if you want to save some cash by chocking down some horrible beer, Knock  yourself out.  But if you want to get something decent, you need to be prepared to pay just a little more at the Duce. \\n\\nAll in all I highly recommend this place. Go check it out for yourself.  I know I am looking forward to my next visit.\n"

I know that Carolinas has been winning the tortilla award for the last 20 years, but I think Revo will give them a run for the money in the next go round.  All of this greatness was accompanied by fresh raspberry/strawberry lemonade that was just like the fresh stuff you get at the fair!\\nI was not as much of a fan of the shredded beef... but that is fine I don't need anything else but there chicken!  the other negative no cervesa or margaritas!!!\n"

However, today I thought I\'d give them another try and sit inside.  Was a little more impressed with their service and food this go-around.  The guys working were cracking me up, very witty and sarcastic--kinda like the personable attitude of a West Coast coffee house; super laid back like hanging in a friend\'s kitchen.  I ordered their traditional breakfast burrito and it was very D\'lish, not soggy but very hearty and filling, eggs were perfectly seasoned and loved the flavor of the salsa.  Definitely willing to try this place again, but from now on I\'ll probably sit inside or put in a pre-order.  Really wish their hours went a lot later through the evening instead of closing at 4pm. I think they could probably triple their business if opened at night given the location.\\n\\nUpdate 08/25:  Just gave this place an additional star...I\'ve been more and more impressed w/ DLish because they\'ve definitely sped up their drive-thru game!

I like the Sushi... while it is your normal American style rolls, the chef will take special requests if you ask. They also have a few unique items that rotate at different times... and allow you to experiment.\\n\\nA tip... go for a early dinner or late lunch, esp if you like things like the Crab Legs (Snow), as those things tend to go fast when the place is full (always been full when I go for dinner).

The rest of the food is pretty much Filibertos-esque but for 4.50 you can get a huge burrito stuffed with carne asada, pico, cheese, and french fries. Make sure to ask for the jalapeno salsa with it as that pretty much takes it from good to awesome. If I'm in Tempe whether studying or drunk and I want some quick food cheap there's a good chance this is what I'll be hitting up.\\n\\nActually, I lied. The Cali Burrito would earn this place 4 stars but being open 24/7 and having the burrito still delicious and fresh no matter what time I go gets it that 5th star.\\n\\nUpdate: Lately the Cali has lost something, maybe it's just I've gotten burnt out on it but it just doesn't seem as amazing as it used to.

aS"I found Eliana's when I was on a quest to find pupusas. I am from So Cal and I really miss the easy access to authentic multicultural cuisines. Currently I am on a new quest. This one is to get my 6yo daughter to try more things beyond her usual chicken. I thought of Eliana's because a cheese pupusa is pretty tame and kid friendly. She flipped for the pupusas (plain cheese-no condiments) and the Ensalada de Fruta (pineapple) and I got to feed my craving. \\n\\nBrought the hubby here as well and I am pretty sure he had Arroz a la Valencia. Hard to remember because it disappeared so quickly. Eliana's is a bit of a drive from our house, but it is becoming a family favorite nonetheless.\\n\\nThe service was good and quick. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the Plantanos Fritos con Crema y Frijoles as either an appetizer or dessert. Too yummy! And yes, the decor is shabby but the prices are low - it all evens out as far as I am concerned. Though try to get a table instead of a booth - the booths are pretty uncomfortable.\n"

aS'I love Fajitas.  Have since I started going there as a kid.  Would I recommend anything other than the fajitas?  No, not really.  Its a bit pricey for me to be going very often, its special occasion priced for my budget.  \\nYou get a skillet of piping hot meat and onions.  You get a side dish of pico, cheese and sour cream.  For people who like flour tortillas, this is HEAVEN.  they are homemade, thick, puffy, my mom eats them all by themselves and is more than happy.  I like to supplement with a side of beans and guacamole.  When less pregnant, well, much less pregnant I really like their margaritas too.\n'

The person I was with also got a burger and said it was really good. We tried a few of the beers and were very impressed with them! I came on a Monday or Sunday night and it was busy. This is kind of a loud, social place, so I wouldnt reccommend going here if you're looking for a quiet, classy dinner...it is a brewing company!\n"

If I close my eyes I am taken back to the old drive-ins with the little trays that hooked on the car window and cute roller-skating cheerleader type waitresses who could balance 4 shakes, 2 soda pops  and  6 burgers  and  fries all on one little tray  . . . and it only cost $3.50.

aS"This is authentic Mexican Food.  I've been in Phoenix since 1963 and think most of the great Mexican restaurants are long gone. But, the beef tacos at Armando's are the best in town, in my humble opinion.  They are wonderful homemade shredded Angus beef served sizzling hot, so hot they sometime melt the plate.  They are dressed with copious amounts of shredded yellow and white cheese and shredded lettuce.  The salsas served at the side bar are homemade and delicious with a nice kick. The red is awesome!  Even the beans are the perfect texture and consistency, well refried but firm and not watery or cooked to mush.\\n\\nThey serve a wide variety of Mexican favorites, including tasty fish tacos, adovada, carnitas, and even menudo (Sunday's).  The cheese enchiladas are worth writing home about with a fresh red sauce.  Mouth watering!  The combination plates I've tried have all been great and come laden with high quality food. They have a daily $5 special combo that is always pleasing.  But, on days when the beef taco combo is the $5 special, I feel like I won the lottery.\\n\\nAll the food seems made onsite with care.  Its also fast and cheap!  Armandos is open 24 hours and always seems to have steady traffic, but ive never seen it crowded or had to wait long for my meal.  \\n\\nThe decor is fifties Dairy Queen type chairs and tables with some booths, and tired, but kept very clean.  Armando's may not be pretty but it's about the food. Often you'll catch a whiff of bleach which seem kind of reassuring in what could be considered a bit of a dive.  But ignore the surrounding and scarf down a beef taco or three, and you'll know what I mean.\n"

Surely I wasn\'t in Scottsdale anymore... this sounded like heaven to me! I could hardly contain my excitement when we finally entered this humble abode of brunch delight! At last- I found a joint that didn\'t resemble a Denny\'s or Ihop. I was delighted to say the very least. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito and I of course had to get the Chile Adovada. It was pure bliss. The plate was large enough to feed 2 but I was starving. Every bite was out of this world! I could talk about the food for hours but let me move on to the ambiance. It was about as cool as the food. I felt like I was part of a club or something of that nature. There are no signs on the door advertising the place so it felt a little secretive. Pretty cool huh! The staff was super friendly and inviting. I topped off my weekend brunch with a small glass of jalapeno infused tequila. Careful if you don\'t like spicy flavors!

I was impressed by the variety of food they had available, most notably the Teriyaki beef which is among the best I have ever tasted.  Growing up in Hawaii this is no small feat... I used to live off of the stuff.  They also had some interesting drinks available at the bar, including a sparkling sake beer (that is the only way I can think to describe it) that was quite addicting.\n"

The service was a bit hit-and-miss, but that can be forgiven, considering the restaurant hadn't opened to the public and was still ironing out the bugs.\\n\\nOur party of four shared the mussels and rock shrimp for appetizers. While the shrimp were good (a bit over-fried for my taste, but the r\\u00e9moulade was quite tasty), the mussels were outstanding. The broth was exceptionally flavorful, and the shellfish was cooked perfectly. My only gripe is with the pomme frites included in the bowl -- were they left out, I wouldn't miss them one iota. \\n\\nFor dinner, our table ordered the salmon, the crab-stuffed chicken and the fish  and  chips, while I dined on the bone-in rib eye. The dry-aged steak was cooked to perfection and served with a delightfully flavorful jus, though there was a large portion of fat and gristle in the steak. The fish portion of my wife's dish was wonderful, while the chips were nothing more than the fries included with the mussels. The cod was cooked to perfection, and was battered in a spicy beer batter that perfectly complimented the very dilly from-scratch tartar sauce. My dining companions raved about the other dishes.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared the peanut butter cup, which is composed of a warm peanut butter mousse topped with chocolate gelato. It was decadent and quickly devoured by the four of us.\\n\\nMy biggest gripe comes not about the food, but about the service at the bar, where some in my party waited more than 10 minutes prior to being seated for requests as simple as a martini or a draft beer.

For drinks, we both opted for glasses of water, and they offered water with cucumber which was very satisfying, and much better than the typical nasty tap water you find most places.\\n\\nThe staff was super friendly and it was quiet inside so we could carry on a conversation easily.  Our total tab was just under $20.\\n\\nWe will definitely go back and I'm going to try one of their milkshakes next time.  \\n\\nUnpretentious, great food, great value for money, relaxing environment and friendly staff.

aS"The boyfriend and I stopped in Metro on a Sunday morning while wandering Old Town in search of brunch.  I had been wanting to stop in here for some time... Wish I had made it in sooner! We sat indoors after deciding it was too warm on the patio (I might've been a lil hungover) and they were very nice about relocating us.  \\nOn to the food... I ended up ordering the chicken salad on croissant. Yummm! The golden raisins and sliced apples made this sandwich delectable.  It also seemed there was some kind of marmalade on the sandwich.  The boyfriend had the salmon and ate every morsel on his plate, but admitted to jealousy that mine was better.  Service was really good, food was very good.   I'm hoping to get back and try their happy hour and late night menus some time soon!\n"

I have moved and now drive 45 minutes to see him with no complaints.  He not only is a wonderful vet who takes his time with each patient, he will tell you when he doesn't know something, needs to do research, or will refer you to a great specialist.  He also is very cost-conscious and while I will do whatever I need to with my animals, it is appreciated that he understands that not everyone can afford to do everything.

aS"Sky Harbor International is a unique airport in that the rental car companies are located off premises in a separate building. However, I found that not to be a problem. Sky Harbor provides shuttle buses to the rental car building. The shuttle bus area is well marked and they even have people helping you get on the shuttle buses. Finding Avis Rent A Car was a breeze.\\n\\nThe Avis counter is well designed and well laid out. If you're a regular Avis customer then you can locate your name on the board and then proceed on downstairs to your rental car. This was my first time with Avis so I had to check in at the counter.\\n\\nThe counter people were helpful and friendly. As is common in this industry they do all they can to sell you upgrades and extra insurance. However, I always bring along a copy of my auto insurance and I hold my ground about the upgrades.\\n\\nAfter check in you proceed downstairs to your rental car. If you have luggage you are advised to use the elevator. After seeing a woman and her luggage thrashed on an escalator in Frankfurt airport I can understand this policy.\\n\\nIn the downstairs area Avis has a coded system to help you locate your rental car. My key was in the car door. A very nice young lady helped me set up my GPS system and gave me directions to my Phoenix destination. Avis has a great web site and a frequent flyer type of program. Fell in love with my rental car and drove away feeling good about Avis Rent A Car.\n"

aS"My wife and I were looking for a change of pace for lunch on a Saturday and since there aren't many good sandwich places in the west valley we decided Heidi's sounded good.\\n\\nWhen we placed our orders they made the sandwiches right in front of us, Italian on a sub roll for my wife and a Reuben on marble rye for myself.  Wow, that bread was fantastic, you can tell that it's freshly made.  It's soft and moist, I loved it.  You get a choice of several types, but we stuck with the defaults.  The sandwiches were also generously piled with the ingredients, I had corned beef on sauerkraut.  The meat had great flavor and the sides were also quite wonderful.  You get your choice of potato salad, cole slaw, or chips.  I had the slaw and wife had the potato salad.  Both tasted better than store bought, but I think the sandwiches were the stars.\\n\\nThe store was roomy and open, it was fine for a deli.  The sandwiches were in the $6-$7 range.  There were soups and wraps as well.  We'll definitely be trying there again, as it's much better than Quizno's, Blimpies, and definitely Subway.\n"

I am not usually one for ordering soup, especially in 110 degree weather. I had the tortilla soup. I was very impressed. At $6 this is a real bargain. It was packed full of veggies and chicken, more like a stew than a soup. Our entrees last night were the Filet Mignon and the pork tenderloin. The Filet was cooked perfectly to order. The accompanying potatoes were tasty with a hint of citrus I believe. The pork was equally as good. The goat cheese on top was a nice addition. I have been here before and had less stellar meals. Surprisingly their specialty, the lamb shank, was not very impressive. It was not nearly as tender as it should have been. A shank should have the meat nearly falling off the bone.

aS"Been here twice now and i have to say this i a pretty good burger but the smashfries are the true star. The first time I went i got a made to order burger adding lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, cheddar, smash sauce, pickle and bacon on a 1/3 pound burger and traditional bun. This was a good juicy burger with the bacon being pretty tasty. It was also pretty filling for it's size.\\n\\nThe next time i got the arizona burger which is a 1/3 pound burger, peper jack cheese(?), chipotle mayo, guacamole, lettuce, onion, jalepeno, and some spicy bun the type escapes me. The flavors worked well together and i was impressed that while a spicy flavor came through so did each individual element. Even with the jalepenos there wasn't a really fire or burn to overpower the burger but a nice heat. It was a good specialty burger but i would prefer grilled onions on it.\\n\\nThe thing that will keep me coming back however is that smashfries which are great and the rosemary and garlic taste is just a perfect balance. No ketchup needed here the flavors are enough themselves. I have had the fries at 5 Guys, Delux, Joe's farm grill and these may be my favorite.\\n\\nAlso a nice touch with the close location to ASU is that they do except sun dollars. For a price that falls between McDonalds and more gourmet burger places this is a winner for flavor and value. With other choices like Chuckbox, 5 Guys, Whataburger, and 4 Peaks in the area this still is the best.\n"

The wait for a seat was minimal, and the patio was inviting as the bar was fun, and the tables are sooo cozy.  \\n\\nThe cocktails are GREAT. I am addicted to the one with Ginger, but I can't remember the name of it.  I love the wine being on tap, it's eco-delicious.  I enjoy the company of everyone at the restaurant and I seem to see people I know there most often. The bartenders are a delight, they introduce themselves and talk a lot about the menu and choices, etc.  Even the owner/manager person (whoever she was) came by and asked what we thought of the meals, drinks, atmosphere, etc.  \\n\\nI also love the wall of tapes, and watching families bike in and get ice cream and sit in the floral decor of the comfortable patio with cute kids...very inviting. I could see bringing a date here (alas I am married now, so my date is my hubby), but I would also bring my parents and my son here.  \\n\\nI loved the Halibut, the Kale Salad, the snacks, the Sausage Sandwich and I can't wait to go again and try more.  With the closing of Bomberos/Verde/My Florist, the burning of Richardsons,  the crowds at Postino, the valet only at the Vig, the lack of fresh salads at the Garage, cold (warm) food at Local Breeze and the disappointing service at Arrogant Butcher - this place moved quickly up to a top choice for dinner and drinks.

aS"Scottsdale has some pretty standard restaurants I could find back in CA: Mastro's, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Wildfish, etc.  Bandera was a safe choice for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had a slightly different menu than the one I go to in Corona del Mar.\\n\\nWe started off with the grilled artichokes with a garlic aoli sauce, deviled eggs, and, of course, the infamous cornbread.  The grilled artichokes were standard fare, simply grilled and seasoned but tasty nonetheless.  The deviled eggs were ok, there were parts of the yolk that hadn't cooked fully through and were slightly congealed.  Also, the filling was a bit too acidic for my tastes.  The cornbread, however, was perfection.  A heaping, crumbly carb filled with corn, queso, and jalepeno.  Yum.  I almost finished the whole pan, that's how yummalicious it was.  If you go here, you must, must, must order the cornbread.  \\n\\nFor dinner, I had the grilled loup de mer with a side of tabbouleh and mac n cheese.  The loup de mer was grilled perfectly, was very tasty. The tabbouleh was good, not too lemony and the parsley was in perfect balance.  The mac n cheese is my absolute fave here at Bandera.  The shells are perfectly al dente, the cheese isn't too cheesy, and they top it off with panko bread crumbs.  Ahhh, a dish after my heart.  This is a must have, IMO.  My friend had the ribs and they were super yummy, but I'm not really a ribs kinda gal.  If you dig ribs though, they were falling off the bone, no knife needed. \\n\\nAll in all, it was a pretty good dining experience.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale though, I'll try something a little more adventurous.\n"

I even ran home this last week and made hubby try to replicate the recipe on the grill. Oh, and the salad - Ensalada Cortada is really, really good. The tacos are fun and come out individually. Anyway, I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a unique food experience and interesting decor (apparently the men's urinal is something to talk about!).\n"

Major points for recognizing that subpar bread can break a sandwich - nothing's more dismaying than getting a sandwich that could have been good but is ruined by terrible bread! Decaf was OK, a bit watery. Yes, yes, there are those of you who will TSK-TSK and tell me that's what I get for drinking decaf, but in the year 2011, believe it or not, strongly flavorful decaf can be had.

We ordered 2 appetizers (garlic bruchetta and cheese curds), 1 small plate (flapjacks), and two sharing plates (chicken and waffles, and the nightly special, a fontina-stuffed beef and pork meatloaf served with scalloped potatoes and topped with a chunky, spicy tomato remoulade.)\\n\\nWithout exception, each dish was excellent. The cheese curds were so simple, without adornment, and simply fantastic. The bruchetta is definitely not for the garlic-averse (a strange trait I thankfully do not possess.) The flapjacks would be a wonderful choice for a vegetarian, and the hummus was divine.  The sharing plates were as delicious as you might imagine given the other reviewers comments, with the only note of improvement being the consistency of the waffle (too thin and crispy, but perhaps it was intended to be as such.)\\n\\nThe service was largely spot on and attentive without being annoying, the wine and beer list was sufficient, and the for the price, it's a steal.

aS"I hate to admit this, but I liked PF Chang's.  Before you go and lose all respect for me, keep in mind, this is coming from a vegetarian's perspective, whose choices at most chain restaurants are a salad with iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing with more calories than super sized fries at Mickey D's, and a minestrone soup that may or may not be made with beef broth.  PF Chang's at least, 1. recognizes vegetarians by offering a decent variety of veggie dishes, 2. labels them well, and most importantly, 3. tastes good. \\n\\nWe were able to sample the majority of the veggie menu.  The chow fun was the weakest dish on the table--your standard noodles--but the lettuce wraps, coconut curry, and stir fried eggplant were all delicious.  They also offer brown rice, which is a huge plus.  My only gripes were that the seating was cramped, and there was a bit of a wait for a table.  Other than that, the prices are affordable, and the service was prompt and helpful.   \\n\\nI'm all for the mom-and-pop businesses, but for what it is--a chain serving Americanized Chinese food--as a last resort, and as a vegetarian, or just someone who's conscious of their diet, you sure could do a hell of a lot worse.\n"

The concept is really exciting to me. It's all about American favorites made with mostly local and always fresh ingredients of the highest quality. The decor is soothing, with excellent jazz-styled music for listening pleasure. The booths are large and comfortable, and the entrance for the patio is through garage-style doors. Unique, inviting, and pleasing to the eye. The other detail I noticed and loved was the weight of the flatwear. Maybe it's just me, but I really prefer eating a good meal with heavy and comfortable utensils. \\n\\nThe cuisine is what you're really concerned with, so I'll get to that now (finally!).  The only appetizer I've tried so far (because it's so amazing I can't stop ordering it!) is Dad's Grocery Bag. It comes with 3 cheeses (Manchego, Fresh Goat's Milk and Paremesean), 3 meats (Soppressata, Prosciutto and Capocollo), French loaf, olives, nuts and honey comb plated on a wooden cutting board, with the honey comb resting on a long-handled spoon. Now, if only my dad's grocery bag really carried all these delights when I was a little girl!\\n\\nI'm a salad girl, largely because of my grain allergy (I save my grain consumption for delights like the bread and a craft brew), and they knocked the Seasonal Vegetable Chop out of the park. Tomatoes, beets, grapes, squash, corn, tomatoes, cabbage, manchego cheese and butter beans tossed in a parsley creamy champagne vinaigrette. Excellently executed, and something I would eat every day for the rest of my many-remaining days if I could afford to do so. \\n\\nI've heard from a reliable source (my father, who is something of a fish nut) that the Blackened Red Fish was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection, as was the dirty orzo. And the Grilled Angus Burger is a serious meat-eaters delight, with excellent ground chuck and fresh veggies with Tillamook Cheddar. \\n\\nOh. And their hot tea! It's LOOSE LEAF brought to you in a nice little teapot. If only every dining establishment would recognize that loose leaf is so vastly superior to the bagged teas. Maybe they'll catch on soon.\\n\\nFor a restaurant that has been open less than a month, I have to say that they've completely hit it out of the park. My new fav lunch spot, in a complex where the Spotted Donkey, Zipps, and Tandoori Times vie for that spot. The Collins Family has another hit.\n"

aS"If you are from the Midwest...then this place is a little piece of home. The food is great and the service is impeccable. I have a Culver's in my hometown of Marquette, Michigan but can honestly say that I have never ever been there, due to the fact they came to town after I moved to AZ...but all my friends back home swear by it and as soon as this place opened up, my buddy here from Chicago swore by it up and down, he said that he was really happy that one opened up so close to him because he normally drives to the one location in Mesa at least once a month to get his fix so with all this raving I had to go try it out. \\n\\nI got the Mushroom n Swiss single with cheddar cheese fries and a strawberry smoothie...REAL CHEESE...OMG REAL CHEESE...amazing. To say the least the burger was good, the cheese chili fires are a heart attack in a tray and the smoothie was outstanding. \\nI will say this about Culver's even though I enjoyed it thoroughly if you are on a diet this is not the place for you, almost everything on their menu has upwards of 600 calories or more...in fact I saw some things like their 4 piece fried chicken has over 2000 calories. So not a great place for dieters...it doesn't help either that they sell pints and quarts of their ice cream to go....by the way which is also delicious. \\n\\nWhat I felt was nice about this location is that you can sit inside and they open up the front of the store with these huge bay doors to out door seating which allowed for a cool night breeze to come in and you feel like you sitting outdoors indoors. Great big TV's with sports on...and a ton of staff to basically take care of your every need while you eat.\\n\\nCulver's is definitely worth the visit. The food is great and the service is untouchable for a fast food place. If you have never been I highly suggest going at least once to check it out.\n"

aS'"""I had an employee that was looking to get an exam because he was having some serious difficulty with depth perception, so much so that it was making it challenging for him to drive. I wanted to help him out and pay for his exam and new glasses. Dr. Hostetler was able to help him out by finding the right prescription to get things back to good. My employee was extremely satisfied with his new glasses saying, \\I feel like a new man now that I can see again!

aS"Did you know that Ten is owned by SRG?  Sapporo Restaurant Group... you will notice the similarities in the restaurants if you've been to both.\\n\\nTen Sushi Asian Fusion is the full name of this restaurant... and that is exactly what they have to offer.  I've been on several occasions to dine in and I've also picked up food for 'take-out.'  As Josh said almost a year ago, the service can sometimes be disappointing.  However, if you get a good waiter / waitress, you'll have a great experience.  Minus one star for the gamble...\\n\\nOn to the food...\\nFirst, if you are watching your spending, you may want to take advantage of Ten's daily happy hour from 4p - 7p.  They offer deals on drinks, sushi, and appetizers.\\n\\nI recommend starting with lobster dumplings - steamed just right and served with a yummy dipping sauce.  However, Ten offers regular edamame and spicy edamame too - I'd never seen this before!  Their house salad with ginger dressing and their seaweed salad are pretty similar to what you might order at any other sushi restaurant.\\n\\nIf you're making a meal of sushi, there is plenty to choose from... I love the Ten roll  and spicy scallop handroll, but I'm sure there is something for everyone... \\n\\nIf you choose to go with the asian/fusion selections, I will recommend the KABAYAKI SCALLOPS.  The dish has not let me down and the scallops are prepared in a wok with fresh asparagus and shitake mushrooms.  For the health conscious, you can choose from white or brown rice!\\n\\nThere are plenty of vegetarian options and a special 'ten and under' portion of the menu if you bring the kiddies!  This is a good place for groups and I've never had to wait for a table here either!\n"

aS'I  went here while in Phoenix on business a couple of months ago. I was looking for a good restaurant not too far from my hotel, and although this seemed to be in a weird location the food is great! I had the chicken and waffles, and it was delicious! Cheddar waffles...  crispy deep fried chicken... it was amazing! So rich and decadent, but a perfect treat after hiking Camelback. \\n\\nI also had their chocolate cake which was good, but not particularly memorable. \\nThey also serve cookie dough balls at the end of the meal. Ours were stale and tasted like they had been in the fridge too long. I think they would stay fresher and taste better longer if they were dipped in chocolate.\n'

aS"Oh breakfast, you're my best friend. Let's be pals forever and for always.\\n\\nButterfields offers so many choices, it's almost absurd. You can choose between breakfast or lunch.. Although for me, it's no contest. Breakfast wins every time. \\n\\nThe skillet I ordered started with a hash brown base, topped with peppers, chorizo and avocado then topped with two over easy eggs. It originally came with cheese, but they left it off for me. This comes with your choice of pancakes or grits. I picked whole wheat pancakes. Sooooo good. Everything was delicious. Even the fresh squeezed OJ and I don't even really like oranges. \\n\\nThe service was very friendly and prompt. I could seriously eat just about everything on the menu. I can't wait to go back.\n"

aS"I finally made it here after some comments by an industry worker. She told me they had absinthe, so I had to check it out. Mansinthe, Pernod and one fakey are served and made with a drip fountain. However I think they need a lesson and proper glassware. NO FIRE IS INVOLVED WITH ABSINTHE and one needs a straight stemmed glass. 3 parts water, 1 part absinthe with sugar cube, stir thoroughly to dissolve the sugar, then a little ice on top. Rocks glasses aren't the way to go, it splashes and it's just plain incorrect. \\n       Anyway, loads of good points - decent beer selection for the freshman beer snob, and there are even some good surprises such as the Leffe and Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA. 22-ounce bombers of Arrogant Bastard and Rogue brown are also on offer. Way cool little place. Good liquor selection. Service is perfect, more attentive than my local! Maybe I should start going where I feel more like a VIP than a taken-for-granted shlub. \\n      I was in this happy hour on Monday (free fajita bar, drink discounts!), and I don't think I want to come any time else - waiting ages for a drink and squeezing by throngs isn't my idea of fun. However I guess it should be easy squeezing by a bunch of skinny, assless fixie hipsters.\\n      I spied a number of unique liquors, even CHARTREUSE VERTE! What a treat to sip and let explode in your mouth. Lots of unique drinks on the menu, recommended for quieter times.\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nI've been reading other reviews, and I saw some mentions about bad service. I'm disheartened by this but I've never been in when the gal was working.\\nTry coming in at a different time, LIKE WHEN TONY IS WORKING SOLO. He's pure professional, and if you come in often enough he remembers your name. With me it was after twice. \\nI strongly recommend Monday happy hour. FREE FAJITA BAR 5pm!\\nPlease trust me on this.\n"

aS"Zia, Eastside and Bookmans are the Trinity when it comes to record stores and its kinda funny and convenient that Zia and Eastside they are like 100 feet away from each other. An AWESOME selection of used CDs and good selection of new. They have tons of DVDs and vinyl.  This is your stop for any CD/DVD needs. The Vinyl selection at Zia is better for your new vinyl needs and not so much for used classic vinyl.  Although the back ally parking is kinda sketchy and I can't get my wife to go with me. Plus its lock that there will be a bum out front asking for money. But its worth parking in murder alley and getting hustled by bums. Still 5 stars.\n"

aS'This small, unassuming Thai restaurant boasts a clean, contemporary interior. The staff were quick to acknowledge my friend and I and the early evening hours, before the normal dinner crowd would start streaming in. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and genuine.  We ordered two iced Teas that were subtly flavored -but not sweetened.  They were refreshing and delicious! We also began with an order of the chicken satay before deciding on our entrees.  The satay was visually brighter than I had encountered before- almost Tandoori orange.  There were several large pieces skewers- enough for 4 people that did not want to ruin their appetite.  For us 2, it was very generous portion, but we soldiered on.  Very nicely seasoned while paired with a Thai peanut sauce.  The large menu took us a while to go through, but we made our decisions and figured we would definitely come back to try something else. My friend chose a spicy Tofu dish that was very satisfying.  I took on the red curry panang which also did not disappoint.  The server brought our meals promptly and after we filled up as much as possible, he brought us a couple of take out cartons.  Excellent deal as this was enough for another meal!\\nAnother star may be earned when I have had time to return and make sure this was not a fluke!  Great recommendation from a friend at work.\n'

aS'"""I agree with Ben H. \\nThe jokes about starving Ethiopians are not only old, they are ignorant and tired. \\n\\nThat being said, I would also like to address the age old question: to Lalibela or to Blue Nile? \\n\\nWell, I was a die-hard Lalibela fan. It seems to me that those who eat meat prefer Blue Nile, while those who chomp veggies like Lali-better. I have been both a meat-eater and a vegetarian at both places, and I have to say that based on the Ethiopian cuisine, Lalibela wins for me every time. The spicy chicken use to be my favorite... well, you can read my Lalibela review too. \\n\\nSo what brought me back to Blue Nile? Chef Ron. On Sundays and Mondays (from open at 11am until close at 10pm), Chef Ron serves up the very best in RAW CUISINE! \\n\\nThat\'s right, folks. Chef Ron is the resident expert in raw vegan cuisine and he shows off his talents at Blue Nile two days per week. Before you think, \\why would I pay for a bunch of raw rabbit food?\\"""", you should know that raw cuisine has depth, complex flavors, and usually requires a sophisticated palette. I like it anyway. \\n\\nAfter some raw dolmas (I wasn\'t so big on the collard greens wrapping), Super Yogi and I ordered the living lasagna while hubsky went for the onion bread sandwich. After the requisite \\""""my food is cold\\"""" jokes, we dug in. It was tasty. The flavors of the zucchini flat noodles with the spinach and mushrooms (which I usually avoid)... the tangy marinara... and most of all the cashew ricotta... ok, it would have been nice if it was a little warm, but it was delectable. \\n\\nHubsky\'s sandwich was tasty, but the grain mustard was a little much for me. The sandwich was packed with tasty veggies and tons of flavor. \\n\\nI saved room for the cinnamon roll, which apparently is a staple while the rest of the menu changes based on local availabilities. It looks small, but it packs a punch. \\n\\nThe thing with raw cuisine is that you can\'t have expectations. For instance, if you order a cinnamon bun and expect a warm doughy mess, you\'ll be disappointed. This is indescribable. No, I tried. I can\'t make it sound anything close to what it is. Just know, it is cinnamony and rolled up. \\n\\nSome other sample menu items include mango chili, watermelon gazpacho, zucchini hummus, banana ice cream, and orange cream pie with dark chocolate crust. \\n\\nHave I convinced you yet? Get off your butt and go!"""""""\n'

aS"I think this is my favorite restaurant in the city. I love the innovative idea, the food and wine pairings are superb, and most of all that you don't have to choose what you want... you only tell them what you don't want... because you know what you don't want but sometimes it's hard to decide what you do.  Well, they do that part for you and all of your guests, and they bring different items for everyone at the table. It is a lovely, wonderful, delicious experience.\n"
