S'\tI am returning this product\n\tInitially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn\'t even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want"\n'
p1
aS"\tDon't waste your time or money.\n\tOur dogs didn't even notice it.  We have three small terriers and I thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers.  I was wrong - the kept on barking..\n"

aS'\tLentek does not support their product\n\tI have had my Super Bark Free for 3 years. Never really worked the way I hoped but I spent so much on it I keep trying. Well now it doesn\'t work. Can\'t turn it off and it doesn\'t cycle when the dog barks.\n\nI called Lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period "1 year" they would just replace it. I told him I was willing to pay to have it repaired. He said, "We are just the distributor and don\'t support repairs of our product. That is the key, "THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCT"\n'

aS"\tToo flimsy!   Light also not that bright.\n\tBeing somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes  and  Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light\n"

aS"\tOld Technology Fat Separator\n\tOnce upon a time, not too long ago, they made and sold fat separators that permitted the juice to flow out from the bottom of the separator. This meant that the cook could harvest all of the juice, plus the tasty bits,  instead of, as with this product, having to strain the sauce first (for the  bits) and then sacrifice some of the sauce (a small amount to be sure),  lest the fat start to flow through the spout as well. This product is  really just a step away from spoon and ice cube, and not a big step,  considering that it's not a complete solution. If the cooks's purpose were  to collect the fat--e.g., chicken schmalz--free from juices, it would  present the same problems\n"

aS'\tBeautiful But Dangerous: Buy For Display Use Only\n\tThe Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous.  The handle is much too small for this size mug.  If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware.  The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves.  \n\nFiestaware really screwed up on this one, a shame given the beauty of the Scarlet Fiestaware\n'

aS"\tKeeps coffe hot--that's its only advantage--poor performance and quality.\n\tPurchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it. The heating plate under the pot started to rust; the pot leaks every time it's poured; it's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it; the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months; and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water. We purchased this unit because of the Cuisinart brand and the stainless steel carafe. We will not purchase another\n"

aS'\tWhat a POS...\n\tStarted having problems with hot water spraying out and burning those who stand in front. Contacted Melitta and they said they are aware of the issue and I have to "purchase" a pod holder adapter due to the pods are too thick.

Maybe a class action is due\n'

p10
aS'\tAlmost useless\n\tPlease note that I have several Henckel knives that I really like, so this is definitely not a anti-Henckel biased review.\n\nThere is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick.  If there\'s only one problem - then why do I give it only one star?  Well, this one problem completely ruins this knife.  The \'eversharp\' name I\'m sure refers to the fact that the serrations are not the standard "wave pattern" you\'d see on most bread knives. Instead, each serration has several smaller serrations and spikes built in. I know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting. Plus, the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness. Unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there, you\'ll crush it while trying to slice with this blade. Forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry. I\'ve found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife.\n\nI\'ve come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives I now own. The first was a Paderno (small Canadian company) that we got for our wedding, and the second was a Global bought from Amazon. Both are considerably more expensive than this knife, but there are other, more economical options out there that are still far better. You want to find a nice, thin blade with even and sharp serrations. If you\'re looking to stay in this price range, you won\'t find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that\'s fine - the bread knife doesn\'t need to be strong like your chef\'s knife.\n\nPros:\n-Cheap\n\nCons:\n-Mashes your bread while it cuts\n-Hard to get started through crusts due to blade thickness\n-The \'spiky\' serrations are dangerous to your fingers (think many tiny needles along the blade) - they tend to nick you easily - but they are useless for their intended purpose of cutting bread.\n\nSuggestion: Steer clear. If you can afford it, get a Global (or even a better Henckel). Otherwise, look for a the thin stamped blade\n'
p11
aS"\tLock problem\n\tHad to return the first one because of a lock malfunction (it locked but would not unlock).  Amazon was great about responding immediately and replacing it promptly.  However, the lock on the second one does not work properly, either (it doesn't lock), though I will keep it, since keeping little hands safe is not an issue in my home. This item is a good way of storing blades and disks, but unless Cuisinart comes up with a more reliable locking mechanism, don't count on it to protect small hands from getting into it.\n"
p12
aS'\tWorst Toaster Ever\n\tWhen our wonderful Cuisanart four-slice toaster finally died, we replaced it with this horrible piece of junk, because it seemed most similar to the old one.  What a mistake!\n\n- Even on the lowest setting, this toaster burns the crust at the bottom.\n\n- It is not easy to tell if you have it set for two slices or four. With the old toaster, it was very easy to see.\n\n- The push-down slider does not move freely and sometimes has to be pushed down two or three times before it engages.\n\n- The old toaster let you select "defrost" and "bagel" at the same time. The new toaster lets you select one or the other.\n\nAll in all, a big waste of money and a major disappointment.\n'
p13
aS"\tJunk, do not waste your money\n\tYou truly get what you pay for in this case.  We bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house.  In the dryer, you need to check the lint trap frequently, as they shed like mad.  They are not smooth and cozy, they have a very high coefficient of friction and it's sorta hard to scootch around on them.  I would not recommend.\n"
p14
aS"\tDoesn't last\n\tWhen it works, this blender does a fine job, and looks great.  However, our first one quit turning the blades in less than a year. We sent it in, after MANY calls to customer service, and they kept the darned thing for 3 months before deciding to send us a replacement.  The replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke.  During that 2 years, we figured out that our extra set of blades didn't fit in bottom ring properly, and allowed fluid to pour through the motor.  Great.  I should have save up to buy a vitamix instead\n"

aS"\tCompletely Ineffective Candy Thermometer\n\tWhen I bought this item I attempted to test it in hot water. My only comparison was another grocery store thermometer which wasn't accurate.  It appeared to register better than the grocery store model.  However, when using it to make chocolate fudge, by the time it registered 225 degree's, the fudge was thickening in the pan, not a pretty sight.  I used it correctly and it has been stored according to manufacturers direction.  It has a 5 year Limited Warranty for replacement.  I don't feel it's worth the trouble to send back as I don't want another of this brands products, ever.  It's going in the garbage as I attempt to find an accurate, well calibrated candy thermometer\n"

aS"\tCuisinart HTM-5 SmartPower 5-Speed Electronic Hand Mixer\n\tThis mixer runs too fast, even in it's lowest setting.  The beaters tend to throw food out of the mixing bowl. Uncontrolable.  Would not suggest purchasing\n"
p17
aS'\tNot worth the money\n\tI purchased this Black  and amp; Decker Food Processor on 12/30/04 at Target. I used it the first time to grate cheese and loved it. However, I used it tonight for only the 2nd time to chop some onion and celery and it started smelling hot. Smoke started pouring out the back. I will be returning to Target tomorrow and NOT purchasing another Black  and amp; Decker kitchen appliance\n'

aS"\tI bought the Z845 a few months ago and I think it's junk.\n\tIf I could give this thing a negative number, I would. I just threw away 2 large bags of brown sugar because, after I had thrown away the bags the sugar came in, I could not get the Z845 to work. What a mess! I had brown sugar all over that part of my kitchen.\n\nOn a couple of occasions the sealer has worked without creating a vacuum. This time it appeared to be trying unsuccessfully to pull all the air out of the bag, but the bag never sealed.\n\nI have watched the video several times and have read and re-read the instructions. At first I thought I was not operating it correctly, but now I believe the Foodsaver is the problem. The first time I used it, to seal a quantity of chicken for the freezer, it worked beautifully. It hasn't worked right since then.\n\nAnother problem is that it wastes an amazing amount of plastic material. Is it possible this thing was invented for the purpose of selling refills, rather than to work as a sealer\n"
p19
aS"\tNot that great\n\tThese dishes, first of all, are just beautiful.  The white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous.  That said, be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them. They break horribly easily and the cleanup, well, we just won't go there.  I've had mine for 10 years and now I'm down to just two of the serving pieces.  They break very easily in the oven, in the cabinet, you name it, it's gone.  If you're looking for a better one, go for the Le Creuset La Poterie line, or just grab a Longaberger one.  They're definitely worth it because you'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece.  I hate trying to clean these after using them so I just don't use them anymore for anything but to mix items.  That way, nothing gets baked on them and I am not breaking nails scouring off the mess.  I definitely recommend getting something else\n"
p20
aS"\tBroken\n\tWe registered for this as a wedding gift and were disappointed to find the large dish shattered in both the first AND second box we picked up. It's a very attractive set; too bad it can't actually contain food due to broken corners, can't be washed in a dishwasher, can't be used on the stove, and can't be used to broil! You can't use the ramikin dishes for creme brulee, which is why I wanted them. Additionally, Target doesn't allow you to open the box in the store to check the merchandise. I realize most of the other reviews complain about the shattering too, but I just thought I'd point out that the Corningware doesn't have to be shipped to you to arrive broken\n"
p21
aS'\tHard to clean\n\tI picked this up recently and tried several varieties of loose tea in it.  The bottom line is that tea does get stuck in the one that I own.  I have tried a couple of methods to get the tea out to no avail.  It might be hard to see from the picture, but the "holes" for the water are actually slits in the bottom around the bottom rim of the infuser.  The slits are actually sickle shaped and the tea gets caught in the narrow areas.  I imaging that differences in the cuts would either make or break this product.  In my case they make me want to break it\n'

aS"\tBurns rice even w/ more h20\n\tBought one recently from a Mervyns sale.  Rice burned especially at the bottom (black  and  crunchy).  So I returned and got another one in case the 1st one was defective.  Nope, did the same thing.  So next go around, I added more water, but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice didn't burn as much this time.  For the cost and design, I was hoping this would be a great rice cooker.  Design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord, however, this cooker can't even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it.  Yes, I did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup.  Hopefully they'll improve it.  Better yet, maybe Krups can design a better abd sleek-looking yet working rice cooker\n"

p26
aS'\tCute, but useless\n\tThis item is metal and looks like an old fashioned ice crusher, but it is so small that it is useless. Its only 9 inches tall, so if you are expecting a nice big heavy duty machine, forget it. I bought it because I missed the ice in the door of my old fridge, but after trying it several times, I sent it back. It is so small that you rap your knuckles on the counter. I dont think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it, so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it. I takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup, and about 2 cups to fill a glass. You need 4 hands to operate it: 1 to hold the lid, 1to turn the crank,1to keep it from bouncing all over the place, and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place  (it slides out and then the ice lands on the base). Then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice, you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass. I broke the glass the first time i tried it. It hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear, making it even more wobbly. But as I said in the begging, it IS cute\n'
p27
aS"\tThis oven stinks!\n\tI thought it was me but every time that I lift the cover on this oven, there is this strange rotting smell.  It doesn't seem to matter what has been in there, either.  No matter what food...same rotting smell.\n\nIn fact, whenever I lift the cover, my wife goes running from the room holding her nose, screaming about how disgusting it is.\n"

aS"\tNot non-stick!\n\tI have used this pan 3 times, twice to cook meat. It does not brown; the meat stick to the pan. I made stuffed artichokes last night and even though I used olive oil and water to begin the steaming process, the pan was a mess to clean. I have never had any problems with Myers anodized pans, 18/10 pans or,of couse, teflon. I'm not sure what this pan will be useful for but I believe I will only use it for vegetables or rice\n"

aS'\tGreat coffee but too easy to break\n\tI was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after I figured out how to make it work, loved it. After a while the latch on the top broke off and I had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee. That made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down. It was a little inconvenient but I got use to it. Then the metal filter broke and I decided to get a new one. Luckily I put the old one in the garage for "spare parts" because not long after I started using the new one the side tab broke off and I had to grab a replacement off the old one. I will probably not purchase this brand again\n'

p34
aS'\tengineering missed again\n\tits just a simple plastic tube that fits on the end of the grinder attachment so you can stuff sausage. So how did they manage to mess this one up? The flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder, so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place, the collar can not screw on all the way. The result? A build up of meat in the front part of the collar. This eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment. How hard would it have been for Kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight?\n'

aS"\tBroke after limited use\n\tMy Screwpull Lever model broke after opening roughly 40 bottles over 1+year.  Locked up and when I pulled a little harder it stripped a gear (the notches into which the gear meshes are only plastic.)  \n\nI suspect the lockup during the twist-cork-in -then-lift-up cycle was due to worn part within the screw housing.\n\nIn any event, it's unacceptable for something this expensive to fail with\nsuch limited use.  At the very least, the gear mechanism should be stainless steel vice metal-plastic to provide better wear.\n\nPlus, we just talking about a stupid corkscrew.  How hard /costly would it be to build something decent vice a piece of overpriced yuppy crap??\n"
p38
aS"\tA dud!\n\tI got the machine yesterday and was so excited. I got it all ready to prime by following the directions, and it didn't work. After several attempts I called Bunn customer service thinking that I must be doing something wrong. When I talked to the customer service rep. he told me that the machine wasn't pumping hot water into the reservoir and that this was a common problem with the machine. I'm thinking for $200.00 this isn't right, and why hasn't the company fixed it? He was very nonchalant about it as if it didn't matter; just get a new one. This just isn't acceptable to me. There are many positive reviews so I'm sure if you get a working one than you'll probably be happy with it. As for me, I refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company isn't even trying to remedy. Therefore, I'm sending it back to Amazon for a full refund and buying the Simple Human coffee maker which has gotten great reviews\n"
p39
aS"\tCuisinart is not testing these toasters...\n\tI saw many good reviews for this toaster and a few bad ones too. I took my chances and ordered one anyway.\n\nCuisinart is not testing these toasters. It took 10 seconds for me to see that the inner elements are not heating up. They are cleaning them, possibly changing the elements, and shipping them.  My guess is that it is just cheaper not to test them. Big mistake. It's harder to win back customers than to keep them.\n"
p40
aS"\tNot enough words for this near criminal activity\n\tEasily the worst toaster ever.  Brendaa the 5 star above must have gotten the single toaster in the whole production series that actually worked.  There are just not enough words in the English Language to describe this utterly useless peice of junk that will not hold toast down etc. etc..  Well, maybe not useless, if you are looking for something to bring about a cathartic welling of emotions that has you standing in the yard with a maul and and a toaster at your feet.  I'd give it a minus 5 stars, but they do not even have a 0 star vote\n"

p43
aS"\tHigh price but cheap parts\n\tThe Littermaid Mega is absolutely one of the worst purchases I have ever made.  In less than two months time, the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely.  Litter Maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat.  Well, I have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily.  The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works, but it constantly jammed and then shut down (and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter).  After a few weeks of this load, the tiny (and very loud) motor simply gave up.  I'm waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair/replacement, but I suspect I'll end up returning to a traditional $5.00 litter tray.  The overall concept of the Litter Maid is good, but without sturdier components, it ends up being trash in no time\n"

aS"\tGood coffee but bad workmanship\n\tThe machine is easy to use and makes great espresso ... when it's working!Mine broke down within the first year.

What a surprise we got!

Being the handy man that I am, I fixed it.  Today (9/6/2005) it burned out again.  This grill is a fire hazard and should be recalled.  It is a piece of junk.

aS"\tVerry disappointed with Cuisinart\n\tYour freezer needs to at least zero degrees F in order to have the bowl freeze to a point the ice cream comes out a consistency thicker than a very thin milk shake. I needed a seperate chest freezer in order to achieve these temps.\n\nThe ice cream maker is made of cheap plastic which caused it to break after two weeks of mild use.  We attempted to correct the problem with Cuisinart via e-mail and phone calls and the issue still is not resolved and therefore we are returning the ice cream maker.\n\nNegative points aside, the ice cream maker did make great ice cream. (Thanks mostly to the Ben and Jerry's recipe book we ordered at the same time.)  We'll look into getting a better quality ice cream  maker in the near future. It won't be made by Cuisinart\n"

aS"\tGood for 4 Years\n\tI've had this toaster for four years now. It just started going down hill recently. \n-It started toasting too darkly on the settings I had consistently used for years. \n-The digital setting knob no longer works, it is stuck on 4. \n-It only shuts off when manually popped up. \nI have to agree with other reviews that said it doesn't toast very even.

aS"\tWhat a Disappointment\n\tI used this maybe a dozen times before I stopped using it out of disgust. The surface is fragile and hard to clean. I reheated pizza and the residue stuck so tightly it could only be scraped off with extreme care. I did a bone-in slow roast and the weight alone pierced the surface so the juices bled into the matting layer. What's the point if you can't clean it or let anything harder than Jell-O come into contact with it. \n\nJust to clarify--the mat was used to line an airbake cookie sheet for the pizza and to line a baking pan with the roast atop of a bed of carrots and celery. I like my pizza crisp yet moist so I reheat it in a skillet when I can. I bake thin or drier pizza on an insulated sheet to keep it from getting desiccated. When I make a roast--I don't need any gravy. I slow roast the Alton Brown way and the juice stays in the meat rather than ending up in the bottom of the pan. The meat literally makes its own au jus in your mouth. I put a bed of vegetables on the bottom to further reduce the heat transfer from the pan to the meat.  Not cooking for a crowd?  Try a 3 inch thick steak (stood on end) cooked this way. You won't want to share. I don't slow roast turkey but it only takes 2-1/2 hours to do a 14-16 pound bird if you temper it properly. My sister always gets comments on how moist and juicy it is. \n\nIn fairness, when I gave my neice two of my unused large pastry/baking mats, she used them successfully to make her chocolate dipped strawberries, turtles, etc.\n"

aS'\tRust\n\tI bought this flatware in spite of the warnings about rust.  Well, sure enough, rust started to form on the knives just after the first run through the dishwasher.  The rust spots were small, but I returned the set anyways, as I am not willing to risk the severe rust problems reported by others.\n\nAnd just for the record, I did not use lemon detergent, and I only allowed the set to stay in the dishwasher a short while after the cycle completed.  This set is at best a high maintenance proposition.  Hand washing and drying is not for me!  \n\nIts a shame, because the set really is beautiful\n'

aS'\tStopped Working in less than two months of owning it\n\tI was pretty happy with this toaster oven until last night when it just stopped working while I was baking some potatoes. I have no idea why it would just quit working like that. I am not happy at all with this product\n'

aS"\tThe first Atlantis was destroyed; this one should be too!\n\tThe first, and only time, I tried to use this compact carpet cleaner was a total disaster. While removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture, the delivery men stained the new carpet. I whipped out our new Atlantis, filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge. With manual in hand, I tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs... The unit did not dispense soapy water, the hand-held wand leaked, and finally I discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet, creating a soggy new stain. So here I am with two stains on my now very wet carpet, furniture being delivered and an Atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until I can find a large sledge hammer. Don't waste your money with this thing. There has to be a better answer\n"

aS"\tVery low quality steel\n\tI liked the look of these pots. I bought several 2 and 3qt pots mainly for boiling water for pasta, potatoes etc. The stainless steel used is very poor quality.\n\nAfter just over a month all of them have rust spots on the bottoms and where the handles meet the pot. After the first use I noticed small discolored spots on the inside bottoms, not your typical discoloration from heat, and they would not polish out with bar keepers friend. These spots are now where I see rust forming after each use. These are definitly no where near the quality of my all-clad and calphalon stainless steel cookware, but then again neither is the price.\n\nAll said I wouldn't buy them again. Even cheap stainless steel pots and pans shouldn't rust with normal use. Even the free Cuisinart Santoku Knife I received is rusting and I've only used it 3 times. I cannot stress how bad the steel is!\n\nAs far as cooking goes, they work great. The aluminum core bottoms conduct the heat well. They also have a great look aside from the rusting\n"

aS"\tBad design/cheap materials\n\tWe're a small restaurant (16 seats), serving dinner 4 nights a week, and we use the blender for soups, Caesar dressing, etc., once or twice a week, but never use ice in it or anything like that. We've had two of this same model now, and had the same problem with both of them. The black collar, the part of the base where you set the container, is plastic, and on both blenders has broken. The first time it lasted almost a year, and we figured that wasn't too bad -- especially when you compare the cost to a true commercial/professional blender, which are $300+. Also, we really like the blender in terms of function, so we picked up another one. This time, the exact same thing happene, except that the collar cracked within 2 weeks!! \n\nMy other complaint is that I found Waring Customer Service to be disinterested  and  unhelpful -- especially because I contacted them about buying a new model, not about problems with the one we had. I saw a model on their website but no purchasing info was listed; I emailed to find out where to purchase, and the rep seemed almost inconvenienced by my inquiry\n"

aS"\tA disapointment, it lasted just two years\n\tThis percolater makes great coffee and I was very happy with it until it broke within two years. Actually the first thing that broke was the little plastic knob on the top. I called the company and they were very nice about it. They quickly sent me a replacement part. I thought, what a great company. Then when it would not work one morning just a little over two years after I bought it I called them again. They explained that it was no longer under warranty (I think I missed the warranty term by a month or two.) They offered that I could purchase a refurbished one from them for about half the price of the original (I paid about $70.00, a refurbished one was, I think, $35.00) but it came with no warranty and I'd have to pay shipping. I was very, very disappointed. Thankfully, I had my old drip coffee maker in the attic. I pulled that out and have been using it although it does not make as good a cup of coffee as this percolator did. \nThis product should have lasted me years. I am looking for another good cordless percolator but would not consider another product by this company. I gave it the two star rating instead of one because it did truly make a good cup of coffee but the two year life is just not worth the cost\n"

aS'\tI was looking for more...\n\tI can not testify as to how well this unit makes toast. I basically bought this Toaster oven for it oven capabilities. \n* I like the fact that the oven cuts off after the timer expires.     Things burn quicker in a toaster oven.\n\n* My major gripe: I often can not selected the correct oven temperature. For example, today I needed to warm up some bread sticks to go with Italian dish. The box told me to set the temperature to 375 degress. Guess what, there is no 375 degree temperature on this unit. There is a 355 and 390. Other frequently requested temperature settings missing on this unit are 350, 400, 450. 425 is the only relatively common temperature setting that is found on this Toaster Oven. \nAs a "don\'t fire up the big oven heating up the house on a hot summer day" unit, this toaster oven comes up a little short\n'

aS"\tDO NOT ORDER THIS FROM AMAZON\n\tI grew up with Corelle. My mom still has a complete set she got before I was born. It survived four kids--all boys--and three marriages. I thought it was indestructible.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWhen I lifted the box from Amazon, I could hear shards of glass scraping around inside. I only needed to open one flap to see that, indeed, the entire set was destroyed. However, I should point out that the problem doesn't lie with Amazon. The damage is PURELY the result of Corelle, which clearly didn't intend for this box to be shipped solo. My advice: pick up a box locally at Macy's or Dillard's or something\n"
p70
aS"\tPretty, but not very functional\n\tI like the Calphalon Contemporary line a great deal, and so I was pleased to find the steamer insert that fit my pan.  But my first attempt to use it was a failure--the small steamer holes (and not very many of them) are easily covered by the food to be steamed, leaving the insert to function like a double boiler.  After working for close to an hour to steam summer squash (which should take 20 minutes at most), I gave up and dumped the squash into the steaming water and boiled it.  I'm sure that some foods will steam in this pan, but items that lay flat like sliced vegetables will be a problem\n"

aS"\tDOA\n\tSigh. Was so excited to receive this item and it arrived today via UPS in pieces. I should have heeded the previous reviewer's warning. Doh! Oh well. Live and learn. Live and learn. Refund, please\n"

aS"\tProblems\n\tWith 3 different speeds you think you would able to make a shake or smoothie in this machine with no problems right? Nope, I am always running into problems with ice getting stuck around the blade assembly, and I do mean stuck!  I have not had this blender for very long, and I really don't use it very often either so there is no reason I should be told my blades are probably dull - its not like I was making a brick smoothie! AHH..  Also why does the lid stain so easily - I have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color!  The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands.  I have since purchased a differnt brand and have no problems!  Looks the mixer is the only thing KitchenAid has perfected\n"
p73
aS'\tBeautiful - but not worth it\n\tI bought my first one about 14 months ago - it lasted about 8 months.  Motor made a high pitched sound and blew coffee all over.  I dismantled the whole unit - it then worked for about 2 days.  I called Kitchenaid - (they are right about no hassle warranty)  They quickly sent me out a new one.  This new one lasted about 6 months - and now has the same symptoms.  I really wish this was the grinder for me - I LOVE the Capacity for bean storage and LOVE the way it looks - I have been forced to look at other grinders.\nHope this helps.  By the way - I used grinders twice daily - in the morn and then in the evening - not like I was putting a whole lot of strain on them!\nHope this help\n'
p74
aS"\tGood...until the rivets snap\n\tI was happy with the performance of the strainer...easy to clean, fit well over the edges of pans, etc. But only a month after I received it, the handle snapped right off. I was draining a can of vegetables, so it doesn't seem to me that was overdoing it. I'll definitely check the fastenings on the next strainer I buy\n"

aS"\tBig disappointment\n\tWe were so looking forward to fresh lemondade. The moment the Salton arrived we opened the box, pulled out the lemons we had bought in anticipation and began juicing. On the 5'th lemon the gears stripped and the juicer no longer turned when applying even the slightest amount of pressure to the lemon. We were all very disappoined, my 5 kids and I : ( I had hoped for better after reading the great reviews written by some of the others.\n"

aS"\tDied after two loaf\n\tBought it two months ago, used it only twice and suddenly it stopped working within a week. Called manufacturer, got return label, sent in for replacement, but three weeks passed and I still have not received anything. So I called them on Nov 17, 2006, and was told they don't have this model in stock. The worst part is that they also said they do not know when it will be ever in stock, maybe tomorrow or may in a year.\n\nI wish I had tried to return it to Amazon rather than called manufacture for return/replacement.\n\nDo not buy this model!!! and maybe we should not buy any Breadman branded products at all since the customer service from manufacturer is astonishingly bad.\n"
p77
aS'\tDisappointed\n\tThere is one huge problem with these sheets -- they are not permanently pressed.  There is no way to get out the wrinkles, other than by ironing them.  Otherwise, they are fine.  But who in the world wants wrinkled sheets!  You should be able to take them right out of the dryer and fold them with little or no wrinkles -- like your average sheet.  These sheets are full of wrinkles and they look just terrible on the bed.  I cannot believe you are actually selling these things on-line\n'

p79
aS'\tNot for tomato-based sauces\n\tThe interior of this pan got discolored after the very first use. It got yellow stains from cooking tomatoes in a little bit of oil. A lot of scrubbing and a cycle in the dishwasher lightened the stains, but the pan never got its new look back\n'

aS'\tAwful product!  Waste of time!\n\tFor years I used my mother\'s cookie shooter to make my holiday spritz cookies.  When I bought my first house I wanted my own cookie shooter.  Boy, I wish I hadn\'t purchased this one.  \n\nThe first time I used it I thought, "It shouldn\'t be this hard to use or take this long!" But I was using it correctly.  The motor is SO WEAK!  My biggest grip however is with the threaded rod that twists to push the dough out.  The rod has an indentation all the way down, so when it\'s twisting, it constantly skips back up and never eventually pushes the dough down the tube.  If I do get a cookie out of it, it\'s misshaped and took at least 30 seconds to get out.\n\nWhat a piece of junk!\n'

aS'\tLoved it until it broke almost right away!\n\tI loved the way the Vortex Digital Heater heated and the way it kept cool to the touch.  But within a week, the one I had started cutting off when it hit the set temperature and did not come back on.  I was worried that it was overheating all the time and called Vortex who told me I could send it in at my expense and pay $15 to fix it.  I emailed my Amazon seller (Louise at Pinnacle Packaging) who was wonderful and paid to have it sent back to her, and is going to refund my money.  I think I am going to buy another one only I am going to purchase it from a local store and make sure I can bring it back if the new one does the same thing.  I guess I am a sucker but I really liked the way the thing worked when it worked correctly\n'

aS"\tUsed 10 times\n\tAnd bit the dust. I use it once a year for 3 days. I'm estimating it made coffee 10 times. Now it wont brew anything but weak coffee. If you fill it to 55 cups it takes about an hour to brew. Now it perks for 30 minutes and walla it makes the coffee weak. I was going to call Faberware and noticed they charge 95 cents per minute. For what? Like the last guy said it's an expensive way to make a cup of coffee. It's a throwaway. So,this time I'll buy the west bend for 35 bucks and when it stops working I'll throw it away. At least I wont be thrwing away 150 bucks\n"

aS"\tThis isn't silicone!\n\tThe cutting boards are not silicone but have a thin layer of silicone sprayed over one side of another plastic that is not heat resistant.  I placed a hot pan on one and it melted onto the bottom of the pan which took a great deal of effort to clean the melted plastic off so the pan could be used again.  I prefer a thick cutting board so I bought these thinking that they were heat resistant so I wouldn't purchase them again\n"

aS'\tsave your money\n\tI was so excited to buy these sheets as my husband and I have 600 thread count sheets that we love. These, I DO NOT love so much. This is why:\n1. They are increadibly stiff. I washed them 5 times before my first use and even tried vinegar and salt washes to soften them- it did not work. They are, however, softening as we sleep on them.\n2. They are so wrinkley!!\n3. They barley fit the bed. The description says that is fits extra deep mattresses but it is a STRUGGLE to get them on my bed.\n\nI just read consumer reports and they recommend that you buy between 400-600 thread count, they contend more than that is unnecessary for a soft, nice sheet. My 600 thread count sheets are much more soft and have very few wrinkles. Dont waste your money, buy something else\n'

I have not done anything to it, and one day the the display is just messed up.  I can see a line here and there, but nothing else.  Replacing the battery did not help and Polder's website offers no information such as warranty information.  It is defintely NOT worth $30\n"

aS"\tBought Two, Both Cracked\n\tI purchased this as a Christmas gift in early December. It didn't ship until February, which was okay. By then I liked the way it looked so much, I bought one for myself. They both arrived within a week of one another. \n\nBoth boards were treated with heated food grade oil and allowed to sit and soak it in. After wiping off the oil, my board had surface cracks, where the oil had pulled some of the glue out from between the bamboo pieces. Within the first month of use, both boards developed cracks all the way through them. Both boards were never soaked in water, but just wiped with a damp cloth.\n\nThis board may be beautiful, but it quickly became unusable and a waste of money. Now I'm looking for a good hardwood cutting board. (I've already replaced the gift board with another.) \n\nAll in all, this fiasco of a cutting board has cost me around $150...and I have yet to replace my board\n"

aS"\tRust on knives\n\tHave been using the set for less than a month. Rust has started to form on the knives just where the blades are fused to the handles - right at the seams. Looks like rust starts from the inside of the handle. Unless design is changed, don't know how replacement knives will be any different. Too bad since knives are sharp and set is designed beautifully\n"

aS"\tfunctional, but they get knife marks\n\tI bought these plates after I already had the rest of the matching dishes. I already knew that I was not pleased with them but had to complete my set of dishes and will have to tolerate them as long as they last. \nThey are really sturdy and go with everything BUT they get the 'knife-marks' - grey scratch marks from utensils scraping them. I imagine that there are white dishes out there somewhere that are not subject to this flaw, and if there are I hope to find them, but these are not them\n"

aS"\tDirty Water Drips Back Onto Carpet\n\tEven though I cleaned the machine between each empty and fill, if I did not have white carpet I would not have known this machine leaks the dirty water back onto the carpet. I had to shampoo the carpet two more times to remove the extra spots left in the carpet. A second time with detergent to remove the spots and then immediately with a rinse only cycle. My second gripe is the clean and dirty water reservoirs are in the same small space. I had to change it out about every 10 minutes. The machine gets one star for the dual brushes which I think are a positive for this machine. Unfortunately, that was not enough for me to keep it. It would have been cheaper for me to hire someone to come in and steam clean my carpet considering the fact I had to clean it three times and this carpet is in a low traffic area. I've had a Hoover for 8-10 years and will look to see what new machines Hoover has on the market.\n"
p98
aS"\tBoils fast but this is a flawed kettle\n\tWell reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst. \n\nWhile you learn how to not get scalded, this kettle is always at least slightly irritating.  There are better kettles around\n"

aS'\ta bad choice\n\tI feel it was an unlucky day when I bought this pot.  As careful as I tried to be, it was extremely difficult to tell if I had correctly placed the stem (with basket) in the pit.  It had to be by "feel," and half the time it was apparently a hair\'s breadth off and would not perk.  Or it would perk enough so that the light went on but that the coffee grounds were hardly wet.  It was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot.  A hair\'s breadth off and again it wouldn\'t perk.  So each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day I got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds.  I am returning to my old friend, the Farberware FC280.  It may or may not last more than a year but at least I can depend on it\n'

aS'\tawful\n\tWhy would anyone want pots that can\'t be used on high heat, can\'t be washed in the dishwasher or can\'t be scoured for fear of removing their anodized finish.  My Calphalon professional pots were very expensive and it makes me sick that they have preformed so poorly.  I have noticed that many of the positive reviews were by people who haven\'t owned these pots for long\n\nI am a real cook and use my pots several times a day, I need them to work, not just look good and this cookware is ridiculously tempermental.  After leaving them on the heat too long, just once, they warp.  Food sticks easily to them and they are very hard to clean because you can\'t use steelwool or abrasive pads.  After a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake, the pot finish was ruined, and I had aluminum coming off on my food.  I am someone who takes good care of my things, and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish.  I had taken some  comfort in the "lifetime" warantee, I tried to return them, but the warantee, like this cookware is absolutely useless\n'
p101

aS'\tDisappointing piece of junk\n\tI have several other Kitchen Aid appliances and they are all great - solid, hefty machines that do superior work, the type of items Kitchen Aid has built a reputation on.  So that is why I bought this coffee maker (actually I have the previous model before this "update").  Boy, howdy!  Was I blind-sighted!  The quality of the housing is no better than a Mr. Coffee for 1/4 the price, and I too, have experienced the leaking problems like other reviewers have noted.  And on mine, the spring that keeps the shut off unit down while you take the pot off the machine to have that first cup while it is still brewing - well, it decided to not do it\'s job only after about a month of owning it.  The unit leaks coffee as if that is what it was designed to do.  HEY, KITCHEN AID ENGINEERS - DO YOU READ THESE AMAZON REVIEWS?  IF YOU DO, THEN GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND MAKE A COFFEE MAKER THAT IS IN LINE WITH YOUR OTHER PRODUCTS!  AND GIVE THOSE OF US THAT BOUGHT YOUR PREVIOUS JUNK A FULL CREDIT TRADE IN TO UPGRADE TO IT ONCE IT IS AVAILABLE!  HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE A GOOD COFFEE MAKER?  MY GRANDMA\'S EARLY 70\'S MR. COFFEE IS STILL PERKING STRONG - WHAT AN EMBARASSMENT TO KITCHEN AID.  Nuff\' said\n'

aS'\tWorst product I ever bought\n\tBe careful to buy products from compact appliance. They will not be responsible if the product is defective from the manufacturer. There is no return.

aS"\tBottom drawer a waste\n\tThe top portion of the freezer works great.  The bottom drawer portion sounded great - no more digging to see what's at the bottom.

It's a disappoinment\n"

aS'\tWater  and  Steam Everywhere!\n\tThis Krups espresso maker leaves water and steam all over the counter every time it is used. I think the "built in safety" features are to blame. The finer the grind, the more water leaked out. Keep in mind that fine grinds are recommended for espresso and cappuccino.\n\nUsing a coarse grind, which is usually only used for cowboy coffee out on the trail or French press machines, I still get quite a bit of leakage. Using finer grinds produces more and more leakage leaving only about half a carafe of extremely strong espresso which is indeed more like cowboy or french press coffees. -I enjoy cowboy coffee but would prefer espresso from my espresso machine plus I hate all the mess.\n\nThe Krups machine I had fifteen years ago worked well but this machine sucks big time. If you don\'t want to fork over a lot of bucks for a "real" espresso maker, try a Mr Coffee espresso machine. Mine, which I use when I travel, cost less than twenty dollars and does not leak.\n\nIn the meantime I have ordered a Lello 45900 Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker to replace the Krups. -I\'ll keep you postsed.\n\nBilly Bat\n'

aS'\tPoor negative pressure\n\tI purchased this about 1 year ago and it\'s only taking up space in my house.  It has very poor suction on carpeting.  Works O.K. on hardwood floors but then again most of these will.  I expected better force.  The small openning may look "cool" but it doesn\'t allow for wide enough sweeping area and I find myself going over the same area again and again.  Also, the charging holder is a little harder to place the unit in.  I would consider look at others first\n'

aS'\tVery Disappointing\n\tI bought this cookie press to make my favorite Christmas cookies-Spritz.  I got the dough into the gun, squeezed the handle, kept squeezing the handle, and nothing.  The mechanism that was supposed to push the dough out thru the disk kept slipping, and hence, no cookies.  It was very frustrating, having everything ready to make the cookies, but with no way to properly form them.  I would not recommend this cookie press\n'
p114
aS"\tGive this one a pass...\n\tDefinitely not up to typical Cuisinart standards. While the roaster is a nicely polished stainless which makes for easy cleanup, it's relatively thin. In a 400 degree oven, the pan actually bows.\n\nLook elsewhere for your roaster\n"

aS"\tPiece of Junk\n\tI've been happy with many other KitchenAid products, but this one is pure junk. The pasta roller attachment that KitchenAid also offers is great, but the width of it is so close to the size of this ravioli press, that the edges of the ravioli barely have enough dough to seal - and many of them pop open.\n\nIt's worth noting that although this does in fact attach to a standing mixer, it does not use the mixer's motor. You have to manually turn the crank with your hand.\n\nI returned this piece of junk, and bought the VillaWare V5500 10-Square Ravioli Maker for $18. Save yourself some money and do the same\n"

aS"\tCan't imagine anyone liked this thing.\n\tI hate to iron and despise the cost of dry cleaning...so, I was really excited when I saw this steamer at CVS.  It was reasonably priced and sounded wonderful.  I was bragging about how much I loved this steamer after using it just once!  It was easy and fast....then, the second time I used it---Water everywhere!  \n\nWater started to spit and spray out of the (sealed and closed) base of the steamer.  I had turned the top to the locked position...but, the black rubber ring (supposed to keep the thing sealed?) was all twisted up---explaining why it wasn't working.  Well, I fixed that rubber thing back into place, but it still kept spraying boiling water.  SO, right now it's sitting in the corner waiting to be thrown out.  \n\nI'm very frustrated with this product, but love the way that clothes steamers work.  It looks like I'm going to have to bite the bullet and buy an expensive one.  But, how expensive should these things be?  All they do is boil water and shoot it out of a nozzle, right?\n\nThis product is a waste of time and money...I can't believe that there were any good reviews.\n"

aS"\tA Big Fat Joke  and  A Waste Of Money\n\tI am a trained research assistant; therefore, I try to research products before I purchase them.  In the case of this purchase, I saw the item during an early bird sale at Kohls, so I grabbed it.  I owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness, but it is really bulky, so I thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice.  On the contrary, it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse, and although it was on sale, it was a waste of money.  The problems I had were:\n\n1.  The cord is too short: directions instruct user to hang nozzle on the door hook which hangs over the top of any door.  The nozzle would not reach to the top of the door, and I live in a mobile home, so it is not like I have the tallest doors in a home.\n\n2.  The most important thing in steaming a garment, for me, is to avoid the garment getting wet.  I did not fill the steamer to the maximum line, because I know from past experience that this could sometime cause the spitting affect.  After 2 minutes of waiting for the steam, I began to try it out on a silk blouse, and what a big mistake I made.  The water spat out on the material.  I thought that I should not hold the nozzle so close, but it did not matter, because water continued to spit out on the blouse.\n\n3.  The steam pressure would not dewrinkle the blouse.  The is not a case where the material was so hard to dewrinkle; it is silk, not that hard of a material.\n\nI have read other reviews, and if this machine worked for them, I don't know how, but I can attest to the operation of the steamer that I purchased.  I dabble in selling clothing on another website, and I have owned my other steamer since 2002, and I will continue to use it; I will just have to deal with space that it takes up in my home.  Conair GS4 Compact is a bust.\n"

aS"\tPoor Quality\n\tWe have only been using the sheets for 2 months and it is already pilling (balling up) very badly.  It is already affecting my husbands sleep so we are on a search for another sheet set.  When you see 500 thread count, you expect more from the sheet but I guess we should have know what to expect given the low price.  I suppose you get what you pay for.  Take my advice and don't throw away this $$\n"

aS"\tBlack Goo and Funny Smell\n\tThe design is ok. Nothing fancy, nothing different, it looks just like any other teakettle. It works fine. The handle doesn't get hot, and the whistle isn't too loud. I gave it one star because of the black goo that came inside. I washed it before using it, and after the water was done boiling, I saw little black particles floating in the water and the water smelled weird. The smell may have been caused by that black stuff. I washed the pot again and saw more black stuff coming out. I took one piece and noticed it was gooey. I checked if there was something that had melted when I boiled the water, but I saw the kettle was intact. I boiled more water and again I saw the black goo floating in the water. I have boiled water 7 times and have washed the pot 4 times, and there is still goo floating in the water, they are almost unnoticeable, like very tiny dots, but they are there. At least the funny smell is gone. I don't know what that black goo is or what's causing it or where it's coming from. I'm afraid it may contain dangerous metals or chemicals that can be harmful. If I keep seeing black goo, I'm sending it back. I think I've learned my lesson. When it comes to buying cookware, it's better to buy good quality. It's not worth jeopardizing your health to save a few bucks.\nUpdate: After washing it two more times and boiling water one more time I got rid of the goo. And I've noticed that the handle gets very hot when I fill it all the way up\n"

aS'\tTerrible in so many ways\n\tI have read a few reviews about this machine and some how I am not sure what I missed. I purchased this machine about 8 months ago. I loved the look of it in my kitchen with all my stainless appliances. That is where it ends.\nThis machine has been terrible, when you put water in it the filter part floats up and out of the slot letting water get into the machine unfiltered. When your filling your cup you have to bend down in front of the machine to see where the coffee is in the cup or it will overflow, making more for you to clean up. I just want coffee!!!\n\nEven though the inside "unit" that holds the coffee does come out, it is not designed to fit into the front of a refrig to put water in it. You have to use something else to catch the water from the refrig then dump that into this machine. \nThey put little time into the design/research of this machine.  I hesitate to add this as I don\'t want anyone reading this to think my home is dirty....living in Florida we tend to see Palmetto bugs. This machine has about 5 vent holes in the top of it, I had two bugs get in the machine. They had full access to the water reservior. Once I filled the water reservior the bugs came flying out. That was the end of this machine for me. POOR DESIGN ISSUES and not sanitary by any means. LOOK ON!\n'

aS"\tHigh Priced - Low Quality\n\tVery disappointing!  Spend your money somewhere else.  I threw away a perfectly good but old made in the USA Thermos bottle and bought this made in China Nissan 0.79-Quart Stainless-Steel INSULATED Bottle back in June of 2005.  Ten Months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it - evidence of the loss of its insulating function.  I think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which I think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside.  When you spend $25 one would think it's a good quality product - Think again\n"

aS"\tFresh out of the box\n\tTook the blender out of the box. Cleaned the jar and lid and started trying to use.  It ran for a few seconds and then I started smelling something burning and the blender quit.  I attempted to contact customer support and couldn't get through.  The telephone message suggested I leave a message and they would call back.  I attempted to leave a message but it said the mailbox was full.  Not a good sign\n"

aS'\tAVOID THIS ONE\n\tOnly had this coffee maker ( second replacement) one year and it leaked from all over my counter. I asked for a replacement, crazy huh, and was told NO my time had run out. Well I am off on a hunt for a good coffee maker. THIS WAS NOT IT !! Do not waste your money\n'

aS'\tfoodsaver cannister\n\tI was very unhappy with this product.  I ordered several cannisters and 3 out of 5 cracked after the first use!!!  I did everything that they recommended and they all cracked in the same manner.  The people at Foodsaver were very happy to replace them because they are under "warranty" but I am surprised to see how fragile this product is.  FYI, they will not warranty the products sold on E-Bay.  I should have listened to the reviews and not taken a chance on this product.\n'
p127
aS"\tDon't buy this\n\tI got one with my foodsaver.    I like the foodsaver but their canisters crack after a couple of uses.   Also the manufacture is not handy friendly.   I was injured and can't speak.    When I tried to get help  by email they told me I needed to get friend or family member to call them if I wanted help.   That just wrong.   I guess they haven't heard about the equal access laws\n"

aS"\tOne KitchenAid Attachment to skip\n\tMaybe I just don't understand what this is supposed to do.  KitchenAid attachments are usually wonderful enhancements to their basic appliances.  But I haven't been able to create volume or foam in drinks with this attachment.  Can't see that it does much more than a spoon, and certainly doesn't do as much as a plain wire whisk.  It's not portable like those cheap, little drink mixers.  When I'm at home, I have my immersion blender  -  a much better option for mixing liquids.  Maybe this is good for something I haven't tried yet\n"

aS"\tBeautiful but too heavy!\n\tWorks well and looks great but lifting is not fun.  If you are a weight lifter always looking for a few more reps for your wrist elbow and shoulder get this kettle.  \n\nThis stainless WK600 one is listed at 6.4 lbs, and the white plastic WK200 is listed at 2.9 lbs.  A big difference!  The stainless one weighs empty close to what the plastic one weighs full.  With a minimum fill of 1/2 liter The stainless weighs in at 7.4 lbs. and the plastic at 4.0 lbs.  \n\nI'm returning my stainless WK600 unit and ordering the WK200 plastic one.\n"

aS'\tDisappointed...\n\tI ordered 2 sets of four in case there was any breakage...and guess what...1 ramekin was broken leaving me with 7 dishes.  To top it off, a few days later, I found a comparable set, slightly larger, at Big Lots, for only $7 for four.  Of course this is always the risk we take through mail order...often it is not worth the time or trouble to get refunds or replacements\n'
p132
aS'\tpoor quality product returned\n\tI thought I was getting a good deal with this deep fat fryer but the quality was really poor.  I used the fryer only once because the lid did not seal properly and I ended up with oil  and  water from condensation dripping down the side.  I returned the product and received a full refund.  The safety plug was hard to use and the basket size is too small for more than two people\n'

aS"\tVery disappointed in this Cuisinart product.\n\tWe have owned this blender for about 3 years. If I had to do it again I definitely would not buy this blender. First, it is very loud. The timer quit working and the band rivets around the jar are rusty. The only things I like about it are that it is easy to clean and the jar is nice and big. Other than that don't waste your time\n"

aS"\tHad high hopes,  but this thing is slow\n\tOXO usually makes great things, this sifter does the job, but if you're making something large be prepared to be there awhile. It's very slow and after awhile your arm will start to tire. I would not recommend this sifter, just too slow for even making a small batch of cookies.\n"
p137
aS'\tPoor design\n\tAfter using this product twice I was extremly disapointed.\nThe drip tray does not catch all the dripping from frying bacon.\nThe grease ends up all over the counter and melting the base unit that the drip tray fits in.  You would think Wolfgang Puck would try this product under all conditions to make sure it is enginered corectly.  My counters are level so this is not an issue.  I am a dissatisfied customer.\n'
p138
aS"\tSent incorrect item\n\tItem was not the one ordered, I returned it and the reolacement you sent was also incorrect. I returned this second item for credit. You had placed your sticker with bar code over the manufacture's bar code and your label was incorrect. I hope you correct your error before you send several custmers the wrong ite\n"

aS"\tNo suction\n\tThere's hardly any suction. I applied a full tank of cleaner on the carpet (which requires a little effort one squirt at a time), but it only sucked up a few drops of it.  customer service was helpful and had me return the product\n"
p140
aS"\tPretty disappointing\n\tI found this product cumbersome, and the instructions for assembly, battery replacement, etc. were not very clear. The vacuum didn't hold a charge well, and it was hard to remove the batteries for replacement. I finally gave up altogether and bought a different product\n"
p141
aS'\tIn the running for worst teapot ever...\n\tYes, it is pretty. No, it is not a good teapot. I have made tea for over 40 years, in all sorts of pots, and this is right up there with the worst. It drips A LOT! Perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout. And no, it does not drip from the spout. Rather, lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot.  This happens with both fast and slow pouring, with full and near empty pots.  This teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot. Just too much mopping up\n'
p142
aS"\tBroken Hearted Pasta Maker\n\tWe love this machine, but it continually breaks down. The plastic parts are too brittle for the pressure that this pasta maker places on them. We have waited many times for parts, and we have waited too long on the service line needing help. \n\nLook for another machine that uses steel or metal parts that won't crack, chip or snap when making the machines pasta recipes. Best to you\n"
p143
aS"\tAuto-ShutOff is incompatible with sewing and quilting\n\tThe Professional label on this product is a big misnomer.\n\nAsk frequent sewers and quilters what they hated the most about the last iron they replaced and they will almost invariably refer to leaking and the auto-shutoff feature if present.  Typically, they press seams as a batch and go back to sewing... only to return to a iron that has shut off and requires a reheating cycle. \n\nThe auto-shutoff on this model makes it poorly suited for the sewing room where the 'professional' label should apply.\n\nThis (and other) Rowenta iron produces good steam and can burst steam to a certain extent.  However, usually between 6 months and 1.5 yrs, Rowentas begin to drip.  The valve design just doesn't hold up to water hardness that long. Failure number two.\n\nFor garment sewers and quilters, a professional system with a separate water boiler (tank) works far better:\n* won't shut off on you\n* since the iron doesn't make the steam (the boiler does), the sole doesn't have the 'hot spot' where household irons drip the water to make steam, which tends to scorch fabrics\n* true professional models have a thicker sole which will maintain a more even temperature (still without the hot spot)\n\nI teach sewing classes (garment, home dec, totes, etc.) and have completely walked away from household iron designs like this one.  You will not see this type of iron in a commercial workshop.  Noone there would have the time to wait for the iron to get hot again every time you've been away from it.\n\nThis iron is a better than average housesold model, designed for 'ironing' your laundry and not for pressing in a sewing room.\n\nFor general ironing duty (like laundry), check out the T-Fal 1759 Ultraglide Diffusion Iron for about half the price.  My t-fal irons (i've had 2) have outlasted my Rowenta iron, with just as good a performance and with the advantage of the ultraglide sole, a ceramic-like sole coating that does not scratch, even  over metal zippers (the stainless steal sole on the rowenta WILL scratch over metal zipper)\n\nRating this (and similar) Rowenta as a conventional household iron:\nPerformance 5\nDurability  3 (before it begins dripping)\n\nAs a sewing room iron: 2\n\nOverall Rating: 2 (because they label the product as professional, where it fails to the task)\n\nP.S.:  for any household iron, be sure to empty the water tank after use to prolong the life of your iron.  Leaving water in the tank leads to premature wear of valves and seals\n"

aS'\tNot Worth the Mess\n\tI purchased this after looking at all of the reviews. What a mistake! After using this to cook single cup servings of several types of rice, there was one thing in common - a huge mess. Even after rinsing the raw rice several times, the unit still spatters out to about a two foot radius. I may try it with a wet dish towel on top to contain the mess, or I may just stick it in the basement and forget about it\n'
p145
aS"\tKeep Your Receipt\n\tI've had 4 or 5 of these thermometers over the years and when they work they are great. But inevitably the probes fail. You will think its your fault and probably buy a new one. But the reviews show that the probes are not up to the temperature extremes they will be subjected to in a grill or an oven.\n\nOne solution I've tried that works pretty well, is to keep your receipt, and when the probe fails, take it back where you bought it for a replacement.\n"
p146
aS"\tFirst rate junk....\n\tI bought two sets of these about 4 months ago.  After the first time in the dishwasher I noticed little tarnish/rusty looking spots.  They rubbed off fairly easily, but as time has gone by, they are looking very bad.  Tonight while eating, I got a sliver in my finger from the fork!  I have NEVER had a piece of flatware peel.  I'm going back to my old flatware.  Sure glad I saved it!  DON'T BUY THIS JUNK\n"
p147
aS'\tPERFECT FOR THE RECKLESS CONSUMER\n\tWe had this machine at work and made maybe 6 cups a day on a busy day. Within a month the machine broke - Keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well (a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem!!). they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going. The Coffee was good but the tea was not. Most importantly people is IT IS WASTEFUL. WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE, AND IN OUR CASE TWO MACHINES IN THE DUMP. COME ON PEOPLE LETS HAVE SOME CONSCIOUS COMSUMERISM AND SLOW DOWN. What ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you. If you are that busy and needy for coffee instantly maybe you should be looking at the job ads or self help books and not over priced hunks of wasteful plastic for greedy americans\n'

aS"\tPLATES BREAK - 3 IN FIRST MONTH\n\tWe just replaced our entire kitchen dishware with the Sango Brown - Mistake...even bought the added pieces...well, we ONLY hand wash them (we have a dishwasher but rarely use it).  In the first week, a plate broke in half right down the middle...then a week later, a second...and tonight, a third..all three directly down the middle of the plate while HAND washing..(not rough washing either).  I have a call into Sango and hopefully they will resolve it.  After reading the reviews here, I would have to agree that its not worth the danger of broken dishes (My wife sliced her finger pretty good on the second broken one) to buy these.  I am going to try to find a set that will go with ALL THE EXTRAS I bought from Sango..I am HOPING I don't have to replace everything!  What a mess!  Sango, why cut corners on such a beautiful set??  Im at a loss here to figure out that business logic\n"

aS"\tIncorrectly described\n\tI wish I'd read the previous reviews! I ordered this for $14.99 as a  and quot;bottom of the page special and quot; and it's going back.

p151
aS"\tWaste of money\n\tThis mixer is so weak it couldn't mix air. It's horribly under powered. Seriously, it bogs down mixing mashed potatoes, and I'm talking INSTANT mashed potatoes! And mix protein drinks?? Forget about it. It leaves clumps because it doesn't spin fast enough. I'd do better twirling my finger in the glass.\n\nConsider using a spoon over using this contraption, and $20 will buy a lot of spoons. Or get a real mixer and leave it somewhere handy - same convience but it will actually work.\n\nIf you don't believe me and the others here warning you, go ahead and throw your money away on it, and then you'll wind up here adding your own warning to others.\n\nConsider yourself warned\n"
p152
aS"\tWent back to OXO twice -- made from weak metal\n\tAlthough this is a nice looking product, and it lives up to the 'good grip' promise, I went back to the company twice for a new one after the metal broke apart at the stress point (the hinge).\n\nI will say that OXO stood behind their product, shipping out a new one with no fuss.  But after getting two replacements, and seeing the third break in exactly the same place, I'm done.\n"
p153
aS'\tGodzilla\n\tWe never even plugged this sucker in.  I wanted a countertop convection oven that would accomodate a pizza or 9 x 13 pan, and this unit was supposed to do that.  What none of the product decscriptions mentioned is that this "countertop" unit should NOT be used underneath a cupboard.  Don\'t most kitchen countertops have a cupboard over them?  Also not mentioned is that the unit required a 4" clearance on the sides: so whatever the dimensions of the unit are, you need to add 8".  I\'m sending this monster back and getting something smaller\n'
p154
aS"\tonly good for very light work\n\tThe FS150 food slicer is fine for very light duty work such as cheese or lunch meats providing you don't push this unit too hard or use it too frequently. Ours lasted a year and a half of very occasional use before it burned out. The two biggest drawbacks are the sliding rail and the motor/gear train. First the slider is simply a  cheap plastic bushing on a metal rod that tends to bind up fairly quickly. We found that a little olive oil wiped on to the rod kept things moving well enough but it needs to be treated every time you use the slicer and then cleaned afterwards. Food grade Teflon or silicone spray did not seem to work as well as the olive oil.\nThe big problem with this unit is the motor/gear train that drives the slicing wheel. The drive gear is plastic and will not tolerate any kind of continuous load and will strip out fairly easily if pushed too hard. We smoked the motor and stripped the gears just slicing up a couple of small roasts and we were not working the unit that hard. \nIt does a decent job for the person that just wants to slice up a small bunch of deli foods for a party or do a weeks worth of cheese for the kids lunches but honestly a good knife will do just as well and not set you back ten minutes for cleaning every time you use it.\nIf you are looking for a slicer to do more serious work you will have to spend the money and get something in the $400+ range. What this slicer is good for the deli counter can do for you for free when you buy your bologna.\n"
p155
aS'\tMisleading Advertising\n\tI bought this product because the box says "no more ice chunks." There is even an "icebreaker" setting.  I wanted a way to make slushies.  However, the manual says you are to use the "icy drink" setting when crushing ice.  I am not sure if or when a person is supposed to use the "icebreaker" setting!\n  Also, the whole ice crushing process requires many steps and more than a blender.  First, you have to pour water in before you can crush the ice.  Once you press the "icy drink" setting, you pour out the excess water into a collander.\n  Even after all that, there are chunks in the ice. No slushie for me!\n  I gave this product just 1 star because I hate misleading advertising.  I will now have to take time out of my crammed schedule to return this product\n'

aS'\tA little disappointed\n\t"Warring" has a high reputation for being a powerful blender. I purchased because of its reputation. But it turned out to be actually not that powerful and may not be as powerful as the one I had before which only costed $30. So I asked myself why bothered to replace it when the new one, "Warring", in fact does not really break ice any better than the cheap ones.\n'

aS'\tBeautiful item but not functional\n\tI researched a lot before buying this slow cooker. I have a Nesco roaster that I love and use often. I needed a large slow cooker. I started researching. Started out with the all clad but everyone said it got really hot. I wanted a good one. The Cuisinart had good ratings elsewhere and I thought well even it cooks faster that is fine. I will just watch it until I get used to it and go from there. Every dish I have watched..they all cooked in LESS than half the allotted time. Today I made a crock pot mac and cheese casserole and it burned within ONE HOUR. Way too hot. I called Cuisinart several times and they said I may have a defective unit. Well I doubt it. I just think it runs hot. I really was dismayed because I love the size and the design of this cooker. Really was not up to par with Cuisinart products that I know and love. \n\nLet me also say that I am a good cook. I feel that I know my way around any appliance. I was not happy that I was not going to be able to leave this cooker all day but I was ok to give it a try. It is not at all what I expected. I read the other reviews here and wish I would have taken heed of them. I had read good reviews elsewhere and saw two articles in magazines on this cooker being the best. \n\nIf you are going to spend 100 bucks on a slow cooker, stop, get one of the higher end rival ones with a timer and then get a nesco roaster. You can cook anything all summer without heating up your kitchen.\n'

aS"\tDisappointed with the performance\n\tI own many Circulon products, but most of which are under the Circulon 2 line. So when this 2 pack became available, I went ahead and purchased it. I have only used it to cook eggs on and I must say, I was sorely disappointed by the results. Not only did my eggs stick, but I used quite a bit of oil on the 2nd batch to make sure they wouldn't stick, but they still stuck. My Circulon 2 skillet makes far better eggs than this non-stick version and doesn't stick! \n\nI'm not sure what I can use these skillets for now since my main intentions were for fish, eggs and items which have a tendency to stick to the pan. It also left a horrible look on the eggs like the kind on eggs cooked with a Teflon pan without oil even though I used quite a bit of oil.\n\nHighly disappointed and will not purchase the Circulon Elite line again\n"
p162
aS"\tFAULTY FAULTY LIDS...THREE OF THEM\n\tAfter using my 3 new Circulon pots and lids for only 2 or 3 months, all the Circulon lids have broken plastic handles, including the lid for this 3 quart sauce pan. \nFirst noticed the problem when I got gouged by the broken plastic, I saw that all three Circulon lids showed big chunks of plastic off the underside of the plastic handles.  I am very careful and do not own a dishwasher. \nNext, I saw that two of the faulty handles now had big chuncks off BOTH ends of the plastic handles. All the breakage occured where the plastic 'cool' handle attaches to the metal part of the handle. Just today, when I removed the hot lid from my Toss and Turn pan, the black plastic totally came loose from the metal part of the handle! Only fast dancing saved me from this big hot lid falling on my feet.  But at last I saw the FLAW. Instead of these lids having a complete metal handle that is covered with the plastic for cool handling, the metal part only goes up an inch to meet the plastic. The black plastic only overlaps the metal part for A SCANT HALF INCH OR SO, causing the more sturdy metal part to undermine the plastic, and eventually causing the chipped plastic to separate from the metal with use. The lids are subjected to steam and heat on a daily basis, so no wonder the plastic broke off, the plastic has no backing. It is just carelessly and poorly attached to less than a half inch of the metal that is attached to the lid. This poorly conceived construction is why the handle broke away entirely after the plastic was chipped, A full metal handle covered with plastic would have been nice for the money spent and prevented the accident where the handle completely separated from the chipped plastic. There is no metal supporting that plastic folks. \nMy enthusiasm for the Circulon was originally quite high, but now that I have lidless pots after less than 90 days, I'm pretty unhappy! This chipping happened to 3 out of 3 lids! AND the Toss and Turn lid is almost as expensive as the Toss and Turn pan! Now, after less than 90 days I must send in the Toss and Turn lid and my 2 smaller lids with chipped handles that go with the sauce pans. Because the Toss and Turn handle separated and broke away, this is not merely a cosmetic matter. Even before the lid handle broke entirely, the broken handles were uncomfortable to use with those sharp broken plastic edges digging into my fingers. Sending these lids back will leave me ill equiped in the kitchen after all the money spent to be well equiped. Further, I doubt their replacements will be any better, and they will probably need replacement every 90 days! Much as I love the Circulon pans, these lids make them a bad purchase. I would not buy this product again. Hopefully this review will help you make a good decision about Circulon pans and their bad lids\n"

aS'\tGr8 disappoitment\n\tThis set looks gr8 only in the foto. In reality, it has a very dull look. Not worth buying. I got 2 queen sets and greatly disappointed with this purchase from Amazon! Price is cheap, so is the quality of the Comforter set!\n'
p164
aS"\tBought this and hate  it!\n\tJust purchased this blender  and  am returning it immediately. It has a number of terrible  features: it's very difficult to remove the cover if you have carpal tunnel, arthritis, or weak hands. To change speeds you turn a dial (as opposed to the buttons on most others), which makes for rough transitions. Moreover, the dial feels very flimsy and I doubt this machine will last. I purchased this model because I thought its premium price would mean a premium product, but from the plastic gears to the flimsy dial, to the impossible-to-open cover, I hate it. Will go back to either an Oster or Waring, both of which served me well, each for over 10 years.\n"

aS'\tItem Turns to Rust\n\tThis item turned to rust after the first use.  I do not recommend this product\n'
p166
aS'\tNot a good foam pump.\n\tThe soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet.  (Children would love this feature.)  You have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm.  Also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually.  You cannot use this pump with one hand - not good for kitchen use\n'
p167
aS'\tKeep away from it\n\tI had one a few months ago.  When I filled in water, the water just passed the filter quickly. I was not sure if the water is filtered.  One day, I wanted to clean it.  I put it in hot water for about 10 minutes.  The pitcher was out of shape and I had to discard it.  I believe the pitcher was made from cheap materials.  I sent  an email to the custom no service of Brita.  I got no response.  I will not buy Brita products any longer\n'

aS'\tWarped immediately\n\tThe other reviewer was luckier than I was. Mine warped immediately, which forced off the end pieces\n'

aS'\tdoes not work\n\tThis unit simply does not do the job. Press makes irregular shaped tortillas and they CANNOT be easily removed from the wax paper. Better job can be done with 2 dinner plates. Save your money\n'
p170
aS'\tGreat device - Until the probe fails\n\tIf the probe was not so fragile I\'d give this unit 5 stars. The remote works well although I have had it lose contact with the sender if I was out in front of my house (my grill is on the back deck). This is a minor annoyance, but what really ticked me off was that the probe failed (indicating "HIGH" reading) in conditions where my MIU France unit keeps on going. Unfortunately the MIU France unit doesn\'t have the remote capability. I purchased about 5 extra probes for the Taylor unit directly from Taylor by mail. But within a few weeks several of those failed. I don\'t mind having to replace a probe once in a while but when you have to replace two in one cooking session it gets pretty annoying. I\'d suggest staying away from this unit\n'
p171
aS'\tStay away from this Item!!!\n\tI LOVE to grill but I keep my grill a fair distance from my house while cooking so you can imagine the excitment I had in purchasing this item with the wireless transmitter.  First, it took more than 1/2 an hour to get the two pieces to communicate with each other.  Secondly, and worst of all, on just my second attempt using it I was watching my pork roast temperature from the comfort of my kitchen when the temperature value jumped to "HIGH".  I immediately went out to check it and the probe is DEAD!!!  There\'s no way to purchase a replacement probe so the whole thing is just a fancy kitchen timer!!  Taylor is NO HELP!\n'
p172
aS"\tVornado should be embarrassed\n\tI love Vornado products but this doesn't qualify. Very little breeze. You have to turn the fan around to turn it off which means that about half the time I get whacked by the cloth blades. It should have a power switch on the cord instead. It's a trendy gadget that will only please people who are not Vornado customers\n"
p173
aS"\tTerrible-Don't Buy\n\tI read all of the reviews and thought this was the paper towel holder for me. Boy, was I wrong. It looked beautiful when it arrived and I couldn't wait to use it. Well, I put on my first roll of paper towels and pulled one off. The racheting system worked ok until it came towards the end of the roll. The racheting stopped and jammed and the paper towels ripped in half instead of where they were supposed to. I am going back to the old paper towel holders that just have a stick holding the roll and not a racheting whisk like bar. Jesh, all I want is a paper towel not aggravation. Which is what I got with this item\n"
p174
aS"\tDon't  waste your money on this product\n\tI bought the VillaWare Double Smoothee maker and it was a problem from the moment I pulled it out of the box.  First, the silver lable was not glued on the product and wouldn't stick.  Next when I made the product using THEIR receipe it wouldn't dispense from the spout and the spout connecting to the blender leaked.  Tried calling the seller and emailing them about my problem and they wouldn't help.  I called the manufacture and since I bought it HERE from a vendor they would help.  So...now...its in the blender heaven of trash somewhere out there.  WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.  THANK GOD FOR AMAZON'S ABC GUARANTEE!!\n"
p175
aS"\tA Total Piece of CRAP\n\tGiven as a gift - same story: The fact that I primarily used high heat, it didn't last past 6 months. All-Clad said too bad after I emailed them, and called them several times leaving messages - took them 3 months to get back to me, and then that was it. I WILL NEVER BUY ALL-CLAD EVER AGAIN!!\n"

aS'\tHard to rate\n\tThis item was ordered 1/4/06 it is now 2/25/06 and has not yet been shipped. Hard to rate the item, but for sure you can see the rating for delivery\n'
p177
aS'\tVery disappointed!\n\tI am sorry to say that I was not satisfied with this pan at all!  The cakes I bake are browning, even burning on the edges BEFORE the middle is even done!  The edges are rising but the middle is  and quot;slumping and quot; down.  I own the Calphalon cookware and that is nice but they have a STINKER in their bakeware.  My recommendation= Look at a different pan\n'
p178
aS'\tpoor pour\n\tyes, it looks good in my blue kitchen. but the water doesn\'t pour cleanly out of the spout - it\'s more like uncontrollable spewing, even when "poured" slowly, and boiling water splashes all over the counter. also very difficult to fully empty. sorry I threw out the box, or I\'d send back\n'
p179
aS'\tWay too thin!\n\tThis product was horrible. I ordered a queen size and expected a huge box to arrive carrying such.  However, it was so small that a pair of shoes could have fit in it.  When I took the featherbed out of the box, it was terribly thin.  I currently have a featherbed and it is nice and fluffy.  This item unfortunately felt as though I was simply lying on a blanket.\n'
p180
aS'\tToo Poorly Made for Everyday Use.\n\tWe have a full line of Fiesta dishware and thought having the matching flatware would be nice. After a year of standard use and dishwashing, about 1/3 of the flatware is unusable. The upside is that it is cheap and replaceable. But count me among those who would rather pay more for something that lasts. We are in the process of ditching the Fiesta flatware line and moving to something more robust. \n\nPROS: Retro Stylish. Inexpensive compared to quality flatware.\nCONS: Very poorly made, Expensive if you need to replace 1/3 of flatware ever year\n'
p181
aS'\tNot very useful - stainless mesh strainers are better.\n\tThis gadget is better than nothing as a sink strainer ( unlike the  miserable Sinktastic, which I find hopelessly misdesigned) but it\'s still far inferior to any good stainless steel mesh strainer. (Do a web search for "sink mesh strainer".) This one slides around on top of the sink drain, letting gunk slide in around it. Yet it\'s impossible to pick up without using your (ewww) fingernails. And those fingernails will be picking up a rusting metal edge, if yours grows old at all like mine did. \n\nWell, "grows old" is overly charitable to this cheaply finished thing. I think I used mine for maybe the equivalent of 30 full kitchen hours before the paint along the edges began to chip and the underlying metal began to severely corrode. \n\nOne way this might be made reasonably useful is if you sealed it in place with a waterproof nontoxic silicone caulk so it didn\'t move around. Then you could scrub it right there in the sink and never deal with prying it out for cleaning etc. \n\nYechhh...\n'
p182
aS'\tTerrible Pan - Does not do what it claims.\n\tI totally agree with the previous reviewer.  This pan is terrible.  I also ended up with only tops.  I suppose you could put paper muffin cups in, but what would be the point of buying this pan then???  Also, these do not nest like a regular metal pan (the sled takes up a lot of room).  DO NOT BUY THIS\n'
p183
aS'\tVery upset cuisinart customer\n\tI have always had a percolator so having cuisinart products and another percolator by them I ordered this one.  I received it the first of Sept. 2006 and on Nov. 10 plugged it in, it sparked at the pot and that was it GONE!! I am sick about this as I had thought Cuisinart was a step above the rest\n'
p184
aS'\tpoor color transfer on cups\n\tI expected the dishes to be more substantial. The plates are very light and thin, more like melamine in feel. The colors on the dinner plates and bowls are like in the pictures seen on the internet so they are what I expected. Very disappointed with the cups- I bought two sets, and only 1 of the 8 cups had ALMOST the same color intensity as the dinner plates-the others were so faded (kinda like when your color cartridge in your computer is outta ink) they looked like, either rejects,or they had gone through a heavy load dishwash 100 time\n'
p185
aS'\tTotally useless\n\tWe bought this to use at events for a chocolate-themed group at college, and used it several times before giving up.\nThe cord is in the way, you need a shallow dish to pour the batter into so you can dip the crepe maker, and the crepes tend to fall off half-baked. We eventually gave up---now we just put chocolate on waffles\n'
p186
aS'\tPoor air movement\n\tThe other reviews are correct,except they fail to mention that the fan does not move air.That is why it is so quite.I do suppose that I got 13 dollars worth of fan though.Think twice about purchasing this fan\n'
p187
aS"\tParing knife is so dull I couldn't stand it.\n\tSorry to disagree with other reviewers, but my experience of the paring knife was that it's perhaps the softest metal I've ever seen used in a knife, and as a result, it's not very sharp and doesn't improve if you try sharpening it. My friend, a fellow cook who got it as a gift, doesn't like it; I hated it and would never choose to use it. There's a reason the price is so low\n"
p188
aS'\tSTOP!!!!!\n\tI was so excited when i found a contemporary stainless pattern to add to my gift registry.  When i received the 20 piece set at a shower I was very ecited until I washed them and never got to eat off them because they RUST!!!!  I called gourmet settings and they are sending me another set but I am removing the 45 piece set from my registry.  I will use them for picnic silverware not dining roon silverware\n'
p189
aS'\tMakes the dog bark!\n\tI should have listened to the other reviews!\n \nPoint 1. This machine is not only just "noisy", it CONTINUES to be loud, intermittently! Picture this: You are sipping your hot drink while reading the newspaper, relaxed, the house quiet, when like a knife cutting the silence, a loud grinding sound flies from the kitchen, your dog starts howling  and  barking, you jump and relaxation is out the window! It "recycles" as long as you leave it on.\n\nPoint 2. It took me TWO cycles (20 minutes) before the stuff was hot enough for me. I like beverages to be as hot as coffee.\n\nPoint 3. Take out your best scrubber  and  roll up your sleeves!! For every use, you have to scrub the thick coating off the bottom of the non-immersable pitcher PLUS totally take apart the spout, clean it  and  put it back together (it has 5 parts). Hope you have time for this!\n\nPoint 4. Froth? What froth? That\'s froth?? Stirring my drink with a spoon makes it look like that.\n\n\nFinal analysis: I can make the same thing in the microwave with less cleanup\n'
p190
aS'\tDon\'t order from Target!\n\tRating should be "0" but that wasn\'t a choice.  I ordered this item at beginning of July pending move to a place that didn\'t have a dishwasher.  They backordered it until August 10.  So I waited and didn\'t have sanitized dishes in the meantime for myself and my 12 pets.  Then, on August 9, they sent me an email saying "we can\'t get this item, we\'re cancelling the order."  I have gone 5 weeks without a dishwasher!  Now I have to go find another online store to order from.  Target may advertise the cheapest price but THEY DON\'T DELIVER\n'
p191
aS"\tCoffee Tastes Bitter\n\tWe had a Krups for about 4 years at the office and the coffee was good. We needed to replace it because the Carafe broke and there was no replacement available (they discontinued the model and the carafe - thanks Krups). So, we replaced it with the FM4. I didn't like the coffee from the start - but I figured it would get better. Two weeks later, I dumped it for a Bunn B10-B which got good ratings here. Get the Bunn - it makes a good cup of coffee.\n\nWe always use Starbuck's coffee\n"
p192
aS"\tI don't understand this product\n\tYou have the bottom of the pan clad in stainless steel...the advantage of that? You can dishwasher stainless. But you can't dishwasher nonstick! You just have the disadvantage of slower heating than you would with straight aluminum underneath.\n\nAnd then you put teflon on something that costs over $100...the pan will last 50 or more years, the nonstick about five if you use it lightly and don't let some idiot put metal on it ever.\n\nThere's no indication that they will resurface your pan either...the warranty just covers defects, not use.\n\nI think this is very wasteful economically, if not environmentally (because it is a massive yet not durable product, even if you recycle it). You can get a cheaper nonstick that will serve you for the five years just fine (e.g. Calphalon commercial), and better you can get this pan without the teflon and learn how to season your own cookware and make it even more nonstick than this can ever be and yet utterly indestructible, even with metal utensils.\n\nPeople will only buy this for the looks. After all, they don't know how to cook anyway\n"
p193
aS'\tSAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!\n\tYOU ARE BETTER ROLLING YOUR WINDOWS DOWN! THIS THING DOES NOT WORK. I HAVE A SHARPER IMAGE ONE THAT IS ALOT BETTER. THIS ONE IS A GENERIC IMITATION THAT DOES NOT CLEAN THE AIR. CRAP!!!!!\n'
p194
aS'\tVery poor quality\n\tThe spoon handle is crooked and there are marks/damage to the wood. Avoid\n'
p195
aS'\tNot of good quality\n\tI was not happy with this item at all.  The pillowcases are really thin and after washing and drying them, they are extremely wrinkled.  They also had "pills" on them after washing them before they were even used.  Very unsatisfactory\n'
p196
aS'\tSorry I got it\n\tRead the one review,five stars,have no clue as to why.It  is a piece of JUNK.First the handle closes on my fingers  continously,next it barely heats ,even on high,very poor  steam.The teflon soleplate is rough and drags on the fabric.I wasted my money on a piece of trash from China.   Hope this does someone some good.BEWAR\n'
p197
aS'\thard to turn\n\tI realize I\'m in the minority here, but I do not find this can opener comfortable to use.  The crank does have a "good grip", but I\'m not trying to grip it, I\'m trying to turn it.   I do this by putting my right thumb under the near end and pushing up, with my index finger on the far end pushing down.  The knob\'s shape (relatively short, fat in the middle and tapering to rounded ends) makes this cumbersome and tiring.  It does open cans cleanly most of the time, but If i\'m opening a large can or several cans, I reach for my old basic Swingaway (which sells, incidentally, for less than half the price of this OXO)\n'
p198
aS"\tPure Junk\n\tThis pan is a pure junk. There are already a couple of reviews and the people recognize that this is NOT a non-stick surface. This is true to the very end, I mean everything sticks like hell. \n\nSo, if it sticks, why not buy a stainless steel pan instead. All this polymer invention is complete b**ls**t !!! It doesn't do anything ! I am returning this and I'll get a 1 yr-lasting nonstick calphalon from amazon.\n"
p199
aS"\tDANGEROUS! DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL!\n\ti have a lot of experience with steamers over the years - mine as well as others used in stores. stupid me, then, for not realizing that you get what you pay for. my jiffy steamer finally died after nine years, but it served me well. it is a machine of substance, solid parts, very stable. trust me - you don't want to scrimp when it comes to working with a device designed to produce streams of hot steam! i foolishly tried to save some money by getting the conair gs10rh, and i'm returning it immediately. the well into which the telescoping pole sits is just about 1 inch deep - not deep enough to keep the pole stable. the brackets to hold the telescoped parts extended aren't firm - any heavy jacket will make them slide. the housing itself is amazingly lightweight; i thought that was a good thing, but now i know why the jiffy steamer's housing seems like it weighs a ton - you really do want the unit to be solidly anchored. handling a steamer is a serious matter. don't take on unnecessary risk by getting an inexpensive, poorly designed, lightweight steamer like the conair. spend the extra money for the product that has been the standard bearer for years: jiffy. you won't regret it. and even though mine died after nine years, i have no regrets, and now i'll do the right thing and get another\n"
p200
aS'\tno more doggy fueds with neighbor\n\ti absolutely love this product. my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence. I hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking "arguments" with my dog. all barking and fighting has ceased. all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now\n'
p201
aS'\tGood, Cheap, with one  small reservation\n\tMy only reservation is for safety sake, it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless, because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet.\n'
p202
aS"\tMUST HAVE !!!\n\tI thought I couldn't live without my Cuisinart or Kitchen Aide - this product goes on the same list!!!  This was the easiest, best performing kitchen  and quot;gizmo and quot; I have ever had.  A must for entertaining and holiday baking - simple, easy - no mess!  Gone are the days with the  and quot;one at a time and quot; with the gas burner!!  Love it, love it!!\n"
p203
aS'\tWorks well\n\tWorks well, well built and easy to clean.  Have no problems after a few months of use\n'
p204
aS"\tWhat's with all the fuss?\n\tSo I read all your reviews previous to my purchase on this AND was skeptical. There were many reviewers that complained about cracks and problems holding an air-tight seal. MINE WORK PERFECTLY! They are invaluable and I'm glad I bought two of these canisters. Are you people sending the canisters through the dishwasher? If so, stop it! The intense heat will eventually crack anything made of plastic. Do you have an OLD model vacuum sealer? Maybe that's the problem - a performance issue. I have the newer stainless steel V2860 and you couldn't pry that out of my hands! I would give it 10 stars if there was such a rating.\n\nToday, I give this product 5 stars. Like most products - only time will tell how well they will hold out in the long run\n"
p205
aS"\tExcellent set of forged steak knives\n\tI have had these knives for about 6 months now and could not be happier.  They have excellent balance and feel.  A major improvement to the stamped knives that comes with the Calphalon 15 piece set.  The wood storage tray that comes with the knives is not very nice (light pine with no finish), but I don't use it anyway\n"
p206
aS"\tworks as promised - reconditioned no problem\n\tDelighted to have it for my wood floors, tile and area rugs. Works great picking up cat fur and other organic and non-organic detritus that collects. Does require emptying the fur catcher and cleaning the brush regularly - gosh darn! So much easier to do that than taking a broom or dust mop to the entire house. Also have to set up the virtual walls and carry it upstairs and down, when I want to change areas being cleaned. Again, gosh darn! Can't totally eliminate ALL the work, no matter how much I might like to.\n\nDon't know what was wrong with it initially that it needed to be reconditioned, but its fine now\n"
p207
aS"\tBest Can Cooler Made!!\n\tThis is the second one of these I've purchased (the first was a Thermos branded one without the cover). It keeps my can of soda, etc cold throughout and adds a touch of class to keeping it on my desk. Both of these are VERY rugged and I would highly recommend over a standard foam cooler. Absolutely the most functional, effective, and classy cooler I've ever had!\n"
p208
aS"\tI love my chopper!\n\tMy mother-in-law got me one of these when I started feeding my first son baby food.  Before, I would just mash up our food with a fork.  This is much easier. I've had it for three years now and it's still working great.   \n\nI use it for everything, now.  My husband doesn't like veggies, and I when I cook I usually put onion, celery, and bell pepper in everything.  Now we get the taste of my beloved vegtables, and he doesn't have to deal with the chunks.  Great product!\n"
p209
aS"\tKicks butt at picking up dog fur..\n\tHeads and tails above my 8 year old Hoover wind-tunnel bagged unit. Never did understand the 8 bucks for 3 bags. Hoover should have given the vacuum away due to always having to replace bags every week (adds up to big bucks quickly).\n\nThe Dyson kicks butt... Three times the dirt is picked up every week when compared to Hoover bag replacement size of dirt removed.\n\nWish the Dyson had self propelled system... The house keeper wouldn't be so tired after 3 hours ;o) Handy hose and a really well thought out system. \n\nHands down the best unit I've ever owned. Time will tell if it holds up like the hoover unit did. Won't miss the belt replacements (2) or the bag cost on the Hoover.\n\nWould I buy another? If it holds up like my Hoover did... You bet... Like I stated before: Kicks butt at picking up dog fur-!\n"

aS"\tnice cake plate\n\tI recieved this cake plate a couple weeks ago. it's very heavy and well made. it came boxed extra well. The box was inside another box surrounded by air bags.  There was no way this thing was going to be broken. I am happy with my purchase\n"
p211
aS"\tGreat, but buy elsewhere\n\tThe KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. \n\nAt this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer\n"

aS"\tWhy use a scoop when you can use a SPADE\n\tThis is one great tool.  I have this as well as the scoop and they are both great items.  I like the spade better since I LOVE ice cream and it makes it easier to fill the bowl quicker. The style is great and the functionality is superb.  Now that Kitchenaid is making tools and gadgets, I am finding myself getting all new sorts of items I never knew I wanted or needed.  I'm even replacing other brands of tools with Kitchenaid ones\n"
p215
aS"\tBeats Dustbuster by a Mile!\n\tThis handheld vac works great. There is awesome suction and longevity. I had two dustbusters that didn't come close so I am now a convert. Only complaint is the stand used for charging. It's not easy to push vacuum into just the right spot\n"
p216
aS"\tGood, could use some better designs\n\tThis vacuum is rather good. It meets or exceeds the dustbuster versions. I've got only one gripe, and that's the base. It isn't exactly easy to put on and take off. \nIt could also do with a bigger compartment, but that's really minor. After all, this is just for small tasks.\nLove the motorized sweeper attachment\n"
p217
aS"\tQuite possibly one of the best kitchen inventions EVER!\n\tI bought this item and had it delivered about a month and a half ago.  It arrived in perfect condition with all the items it says it will come with.  It's very easy to use and extremely easy to clean.  So far I have only cooked whole chickens, chicken pieces, shishkabobs, and sausages.  If I only ever used it to just cook chicken, it's still a great price.  If you can follow simple instructions, you can't go wrong with this\n"

aS"\tEgg-and-Muffin 2-Slice Toaster and Egg Poacher\n\tWhen I was searching for something to simplify my life I came upon this product.  I thought I would give it a try as I love egg mcmuffins.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I have\n"

aS'\tGreat coffee machine!\n\tI saw this unit on vacation and came home and bought one.  That was several years ago.  Finally, our beloved brewstation gave up the ghost and went on to coffeeland in the sky.  So, I promptly bought another one.  Morning is just not the same without our brewstation\n'

aS'\tworks\n\tI bought this knife sharpener because I was tired of knives that would not cut  and  the vender I brought it from, The Handy House, told me that it worked and I had bought things from her before on her word. And it works. My knifes are old  and  dull. A few swips through the sharpener blade  and  I had a brand new knife  and  the price is also good.\n'
p221
aS'\tunbelievable value!\n\tthis set of knives is simply incredible - a MUST for any kitchen, especially a small one or if you just do a lot of quick small tasks.  these things are SHARP, and, as standard for henckels, supremely made.\n'

aS"\tShred away\n\tThis is a great shredder.  Absolutly the best out there.  It is a lousy slicer.  Take the bad with the good I guess.\n\nMy wife and I shred lots of cheese because pre-shredded cheese has chemicals added that change the taste and chemical properties of the cheese.   This attachment works wonderfully for cheese.   \n\nA note on disassembly.  Some people have difficulty getting the cone off the plug (if you own one you know what I'm talking about).   The very easy way to remedy this is to remove the cone from the plug before removing the plug from the machine.  If you follow this one rule you will have very easy setup and take down.\n"

aS"\tVery Pleased\n\tSo far I have made several different ice creams in my new machine.  This is the first I'd ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you don't.  The machine is very efficient.  You just put the mixture in and it does all the work.  You may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others.  You just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency.  I made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it didn't thicken and I wasted all of it, so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine.  The machine is a little noisy but I expected that after reading about it, not as bad as I thought it would be though.  Overall, very happy\n"

aS"\tSuper light weight, durable dinner plates\n\tThis plate, the 10 inch is the normal size dinner plate, just so you know. It's easy to buy the wrong size with these because they come in so many sizes. My aunt has had the Winter Frost White as long as I can remember, and now I am slowly building my own collection. I love them - they are very light and strong. I tried throwing a plate on the kitchen floor and it is still intact. The material feels like a combination of porcelin and pyrex as weird as that sounds. They are so thin and light that I could probably carry at least 35 of them. This is perfect for your everyday meals. Highly recommended\n"
p227
aS"\tCute!\n\tPretty good product.  We have not changed the batteries yet  and  it does get quite a bit of usage.  It's easy to use  and  not an eye-sore in my kitchen.  Very fast shipping!  I would order again\n"

aS"\tIt's More Valuable Than I thought\n\tThe Food processor has many many organized accessories that were sent with the purchase. I know I was buying a good brand but it was not just a good product it's an Excellent food processor and worth more than the money. My wife LOVES you know guys waht that means. Also it has a juice maker not mentioned in the add woooow. The seller was more than Excellent.\n"

aS"\tWhat you see is what you get.\n\tWhat you see is what you get.  It works just fine, there isn't really much that could go wrong.  The only thing is I should have gotten the larger size.  What they call a cup and what I call a cup didn't really measure up.  For me it makes two regular mugs\n"

aS'\tGreat performance...easy to clean....start on top of stove-finish in 350 oven.\n\tI\'ve had this cookware since 1991. It has performed exactly as promised. Regardless of all the use (this is the hardest working piece in the set) It\'s in great shape. I use it for so many things, sauteing vegetables, a large omelette (to share). \nA 10" skillet is a must have and more than one is even better. Please never use aerosol cooking sprays. \nA "pumped" spray is recommended or just pour a little oil or a pat of butter for more flavor. Great even heat and total release, even when cheese is used. Fast easy hand wash\n'

aS"\tBest timer.\n\tI find this timer very easy to use. I'm not a rocket scientist.\nI have never been disappointed with Kitchen Aid. I don't understand why it has gotten bad reviews. I think some people should stick with a sun dial\n"
p233
aS'\tBetter as a portable hot water heater\n\tHaving now owned this device for three months, I found it to be a very useful device to have around if you need hot water and there isn\'t any or no way to get any. Its lightweight, very portable and compact. While listed as a coffee maker, it brewed very slowly and not all that well. But as a hot water heater, it served fantastically well. The typical 8 oz water will heat through the system in about 4-5 minutes, so little patience is needed. The device seem to overheat a bit so cool down period would be wise between uses.\n\nThere\'s an automatic shut off, the machine come with two plastic containers that fit inside the water hold. It also come with a small spoon. Machine often come on by itself even before you hit the "on" button, probably if you hit the button before you plug it in. I would recommended that you have everything set up before hand.\n\nI used this device at work quite a bit and found it to be super handy thanks to the small size. The following products could be considered as tailored made for this device: Lipton Cup a Soup (sheer perfect for this machine), General Food International coffee mixes and various kind of hot chocholate brands. It also great for tea bags as well. I am not sure about brewing tea though.\n\nOverall, this device come highly recommended for anyone who might like to have a hot drink when there\'s none available\n'

aS"\tA brief comment\n\tThis baster is big enough to accomplish most tasks, and it even makes a great costume accessory on Halloween. Except that when I used it as part of my Halloween party costume along with a doctor's lab coat and stethoscope, all the women blushed and left the room. Oh well, maybe next time I'll come as a proctologist\n"
p235
aS'\tVery convenient\n\tThe only complaint from the other reviews that I can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control.  I certainly don\'t have any trouble getting hot milk.  My taste in coffee is probably not very sophisticated, but this machine produces espresso and latte as good as I\'ve had in America.\n\nI\'ve had my EspressoPro for 3 years and it\'s still working well.  When I first bought the machine, it didn\'t work, and the Capresso people were wonderful and immediately sent a new machine.  Then there was a mixup over the color (silver vs chrome), and again the Capresso people were wonderful and sent a new machine.  Both times they sent me a machine immediately, with packaging to send my old machine back, so I had a new machine within two days of calling them.\n\nI always use Espressione coffee pods, and filtered water.  That\'s just what is most convenient for me.  I\'ve never actually cleaned the machine\'s innards, and I haven\'t noticed any degradation in performance over the years.\n\nThe milk attachment is very convenient.  We wash ours about once a week, although we do have to wash the little siphon/nozzle thing every day.  It\'s about as much work as a stainless jug I guess, with the advantage that you\'re not wasting milk every time you make a latte.\n\nThe downside to the milk attachment is that I haven\'t found a way to get a lot of froth out of it.  It\'s got a little knob on top that is supposed to control the amount of froth.  It does a good job of controlling the temperature of the frothed milk, but no matter what I do, I almost always end up with around 1/2 inch of froth on my latte.  Occasionally I end up with a lot more or almost none, but I have no idea why.  That\'s my biggest complaint.\n\nThe bit where the coffee comes out into your cup (you can see my level of sophistication there) has two holes, so it can pour into two cups at once.  This is worthless.  The coffee never comes out evenly, and if you use pods you can only make a single shot at a time anyway.  The end result of the two holes is that whenever I make an espresso, some of it dribbles down the side of the cup instead of going in.  It\'s also a bit short for any latte glass I\'ve ever found, and you have to tilt the glass to get it under.\n\nDespite the fact that the EspressoPro doesn\'t look particularly tough (it\'s mostly plastic, and not really heavy plastic at that), Mine is still going strong after three years.  Much to the dismay of my grandparents, three years is considered long enough to classify something as "durable" thesedays.\n\nSo there you go.  I\'m sure there are machines that make better espresso, but for convenience, I haven\'t seen any machines that can touch this one for less than twice the price.  There are a couple of things I\'d like to change (milk froth control and height of coffee dispenser), but I would still recommend it\n'

aS"\tWorks great\n\tThe cirtus juicer works great (like all Kitchen Aid products) but it's pricy by the time you pay $8 to ship it. However my local outlet mall wanted over $30 for it plus tax..\n"
p237
aS"\tGREAT!\n\tI received these as a Christmas gift and am very pleased with them.  They are very thin so it makes gripping things out of the oven a lot easier than with thick mitts - AND they'll take up less room in your drawer.  Highly recommend - worth the extra money\n"
p238
aS"\tGreat Value!\n\tYou know, for this price, you could throw anything away.  But, this 'synthetic' comforter is so soft, silky and light, I can toss it on and not feel weighted down.  I also have a cat and with cat hairs I can vacumn them off easily (down is more difficult), but just having the airy warmth is worth it.\n"
p239
aS'\tLove It!\n\tI love this vacuum!  It is great for doing quick jobs around the house, vacuuming the stairs and vacuuming up the lint in the laundry room.  I would highly recommend this little vacuum to anyone.  I love that you can use it like a dustbuster to clean to car or use the long arm to do regular cleaning\n'
p240
aS"\tgood value\n\tI purchased this knife because my daughter didn't like using any of my knives; she wanted one like the chefs all use on Food Network.  I wasn't willing to pay the high prices of the professional ones so this was a good compromise, and I'm pleased with it.  It's nice-looking, feels comfortable to hold, works well for chopping vegetables. Overall, a decent knife at a very reasonable price.\n"
p241
aS"\tBetter than my non stick pans\n\tI'm really glad to have replaced my non-stick with the Cuisinart pans. I have been increasingly concerned about the safety of non-stick. I was really scared that they would stick and I would have to scrub them, but they've been really good so far. I'm not crazy about the hazy look that the bottoms get inside, but I know it's because I cook on med-high heat and I need to get some Barkeeper's friend. Overall, really pleased with this purchase, and I'm still adding to my set\n"
p242
aS'\tFinally, something simply works!\n\tRight out of the box and with skim milk, I have a latte that rivals the corner coffee bar.  Easy to set up, easy to use, easy to clean.  Can I ask for more?  What else is there\n'
p243
aS'\tBlack and Decker Tiered Food Steamer\n\tI am replacing the same product that I have used continually for the past nine years or so. It has been an indispensable part of our kitchen all those years and we hope this new one will continue the tradition\n'
p244
aS"\tIf you drink a lot of coffee/espresso this is a great buy!\n\tI love my Vienna Deluxe!  We've been using it for 4-8 coffees per day for 7 months now and have certainly saved money over going to the coffee shop.  If you plan to buy more than 100 coffees (for us about 3 months worth) it already pays for itself and the coffee tastes better.  The flavor of the coffee is awesome and it's super easy to make.  \n\nThe only bad thing I can say about this coffee machine is that the 'key' in the back of it got a little bit off and we had to manually turn it so that the brew unit would fit back in.  It only took us about 2 hours to figure out and fix it, so it wasn't that big of a deal.    \n\nIf you're looking for something that is a super high class, fancy, heavy duty, professional style coffee maker, maybe you should spring for the superdeluxe big bucks model and drop a couple grand.  People have given this model low reviews for being expensive and made of plastic.  Ours still looks nice, is easy to clean, and doesn't weigh 750 million pounds.  It seems like folks are looking for a chrome and steel Starbucks style coffee maker for $500, and that just isn't realistic.  \n\nThis is a great buy and it makes great coffee\n"
p245
aS"\tKitchen gadget must have\n\tI can't begin to describe how worthwhile a piece of equipment this is.  It makes the best little potato shreds for potato pancakes, then, you just switch blades and slice up a little onion for them in the same bowl, which you can then mix the batter in.  The bowl component is my number 1 favorite feature of this little guy, but it just plain works really well\n"
p246
aS"\tGreat Little Shaker\n\tI like this a lot.  It is very compact and easy to use. I like the built in ice strainer. You just slip off the cap and pour. No hassles of the top jamming and having to beat it open with a knife. You will need a finer strainer if you want to filter out citrus pulp, for example. But for most cocktails you are just straining out the ice. But I like this one for it's convenience\n"
p247
aS"\tPerfect measurers!\n\tI have purchased many different brands of measuring spoons and cups in the past but these are by far the best!  Heavy (but not too heavy to use) so the handles don't bend (or float around in the dishwasher), shaped well so they fit into containers and spice bottles easily, easy to level and the measurement markings will not fade away (they are engraved).  I love my set...will definately buy another set (cooking is my hobby)\n"

aS'\tSturdy And Smart\n\tFinding the right items to start the perfect kitchen for two is so easy thanks to OXO.  I love their good grips products.  All the handles look great, but are also very comfortable and practical.  This strainer fits in well to a kitchen for feeding 2 or 3 people.  You can use this double rod strainer not only for straining, but also for sifting flour, draining, and if need be - awkwardly steaming veggies over boiling water.\n\nIt seems most people might go for the 8" instead, but this one works perfectly for making gnocchi from scratch.  You have to make few enough in each batch that they can all rise to the top at once.  Then you scoop them all up with the strainer (the bigger strainer may be hard to fit in many pots).  Drain the gnocchi and place on a paper towel.  Since you can do all this with one hand, you can use your other hand to grab more gnocchi to start a-boilin\' quick as can be.\n\nWhatever you use it for, this is a high quality strainer that will last\n'
p251
aS"\tWonderful set\n\tI love having these Pyrex cups in varying sizes.  The large ones are great for mixing and pouring batter, like pancakes.  The smaller one let's you measure once, to get 1 1/2 or 2 cups of liquid\n"
p252
aS"\tBe a hero when giving a wedding present\n\tOk, it's June and you are being hit up for present after present and you are on limited funds. No need to feel depressed. You can give this measuring cup set and hold your head up, knowing you gave something that won't be sneered at or find its way to the return pile by the blushing bride.\n\nEveryone needs these cups to do cooking, from the large size for soup and broth to the small size for baking. And I will confess, I've used the medium sized one as an emergency gravy boat. So it doesn't look quite as nice as a cut glass gravy server--it works JUST fine.   I also use the glass cups for mixing batters to pour out right from the pitcher, and I use them for prepping foods like stir fry when you have to have a bunch of ingredients ready to hand to dump at once into the wok.\n"

aS"\tGreat grill pan!\n\tI've owned this grill pan for almost 2 years now and it does a great job of grilling everything from burgers to chicken, fish and thick steaks. It has the ability to heat up to a very high temperature, enabling me to nicely sear the outside of the meat. I can then pop the whole pan in the oven to finish cooking the inside of thick steaks or just to keep warm. As for clean up, the pan does need to sit and soak for a little while but after that, everything comes off with relative ease. No hard scrubbing involved. Overall, I love this product and highly recommend it\n"

aS'\tGreat Item\n\tThis sturdy little fan has been working well for months.  One quibble: its two speeds are medium  and  fast.  There is no "slow."  Overall, I\'m a happy customer\n'

aS'\tThese glasses are unique and handy - but a bit fragile\n\tI love the function of these glasses.  We were given some of these Bodum double wall glasses and immediately saw the quality difference.  They will not sweat, they will keep your cold stuff cold, etc.  I have two down-sides...  These must be handled gently, they are not that thick or hearty.  Until we realized what was going on, we cracked two by having our refigerator ice dispensor throw cubes into them, cracking them.  Plus I yanked the dishwasher open fast, knocking one over into something solid, and it broke.  \n\nBut overall, if you handle them with a bit of care, they are really neat glasses\n'
p258
aS'\tBodum Beer/Milk Glasses\n\tWhile these are described as "beer" glasses, they are fantastic for keeping milk cold through a meal.  I actually pour the milk and place the glasses in the freezer while I start dinner.  These glasses are easy to clean and retain their "sunny" shine, even though we have very hard water.  NO SPOTS!  Great product\n'

aS'\t6 stars for being a muti tasker\n\tThis tablemate is perfect for anybody.It has many uses around the house which i could list but it would take to long. It is sturdy enough to hold about 20 to 30 lbs.when the tray is at its level position. The 3 positions is a plus because it gives you more options.The one thing that is a negative is the legs do not fold down completely for storage but everything else folds down(table top and the small bar.other than the legs not folding this is a five star\n'
p261
aS"\tThey're decent mixing bowls...\n\tI knew what I was buying, so there weren't any surprises. The only thing I do not like about them is the shallowness; I wanted that feature for storage, but I didn't take into account how easy it is to be messy when mixing. I would suggest having another bowl around for use with an electric mixer. I like them, and I would buy them again..\n"
p262
aS'\tGreat choice.\n\tThis thermometer has been a great asset to me during the course of my employment at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, as well as during my time as a student at Le Cordon Bleu. Easy to use, full-featured and very dependable, I  have recommended this thermometer to many people and use it many times each day\n'
p263
aS'\tBest burgers ever\n\tFirst thing we cooked in this pan were burgers, and we could not believe the difference in taste compared to pan fried.  The raised ridges really carmelize the meat, and even when cooked well done the burgers are juicy.  We have prepared chicken, pork chops and fish, and they are all at least as good as charcoal grilled.  I would give this pan 10 stars if I could\n'
p264
aS"\tThe best on the Market, Well I think it is.\n\tI have to say that I have tried almost all of the self-cleaning litter boxes out there for my Large Male 14year old cat.  He has the electric water fountain for kitties and yes he does drink lot and lots of water, so you know what that means, yes, he pees a lot.  Oh yea he is a larger (not fat) kitty so he eats a lot also, I aint sayin no more on that subject.\n\nIt has now been 25 AMAZING!!!!!! SCOOP/POOP/PEE CLUMP/URIN ODOR/POOP SMELL/LOTS  and  LOTS  and  LOTS OF ANOYING TRACKED SANDY LITTER .......................FREE DAYS!!!!!\n\nThis is not saying that this litter box does not have any room for improvement, but I am one happier kitty owner.  I will tell anyone that hates Doody  and  Pee Clump Duty, or that hates the tracked litter mess and nasty clumped up (metal or plastic) rake  and  plastic that never fits right storage container, get this litter box.\n\nThe main gripe I have with this litter box is the cost of the replacement crystal litter cartridges, but I have been told by numerous pet store owners and workers that there will probably be a generic competitor on the market soon which will hopefully bring the price of the litter cartridges down.  One can only hope!  But regardless, I am keeping this auto waste center for my cay.\n\nThe other gripe, but not major problem I have seen so far, is with the cardboard for the cartridge that the litter sits in.  Now my cat, with a regular clumping litter box had clumps the size of softballs.  After 25 days, there is, on the bottom of the inside tray, (not the bottom one that actually touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the thing out) a wet spot in the area that my cat likes to urinate at, apparently this is his favorite spot to pee.  On the bottom cardboard tray (the one that touches the floor and acts as the cover when you throw the cartridge out) there is just the hint of a wet spot.  I think that if they increase the wax content in the cardboard or if that is what is actually coating the cardboard this will help.\n\nI have not had to realign the rake as other people have said they had to do.  I do not smell any urine or poop and there is a lot of shrunken poop under that cardboard tray cover.  I have minimal tracked crystal litter on the floor around and/or under the litter box.  The motor is not as quiet as I would like, but then again it doesn't bother me or wake anyone in my house up either, it is kept on a wooden floor right out side the bedroom door in a hallway.\n\nIf you are in the market for an almost maintenance free litter box for your cat, try this one.  Like I said earlier, it's not 100% perfect, but it is the best damn self cleaning, almost maintenance free litter box on the market.  Not every kitty or human for that matter poops and pees that same, so if you don't try it you will never know if it's right for you and your kitty/kitties.  Read all the rest of the reviews for this and other products and see what everyone is saying about all of them, make an educated decision\n\nGood Luck\n"

aS'\tTHE cookware for serious home cooks\n\tMy fiance and I registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us.  I have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware.  This is exactly what the Dr. ordered!  Here\'s why:\n1)  Heavy, sturdy construction.  These things can take a beating.  They heat evenly and hold heat very well.\n2)  You can use metal utensils with them.  I hate plastic spatulas!  We all know that we aren\'t supposed to use metal with non-stick pans but we all do and then after a while our pan is a useless, peeling shadow of its former self.  Well this isn\'t the case with Calphalon 1!  Scrape away with any device you have at your disposal with no fear.  \n3)  They "stick" and sear as well as cast iron cookware (it\'s a good thing).  This is the best feature for me.  Coated non-stick cookware has its place but if you like to pan sear and get those tasty browned bits for sauces you used to have to use a pan that\'s not non-stick such as stainless steel or cast iron.  They "stick" for a reason.  You need that contact with the cooking surface to get that great browning.  Now there\'s the Calphalon 1 which sears as well as cast iron pans but cleans up like a non-stick pan.  It\'s a no-brainer!  \n4)  They look cool, have great handles, they\'re oven-safe, and they come with a lifetime warranty.  \n\nThese are not cheap.  If your primary goal in cookware is super easy cleanup then don\'t buy this expensive set.  It will dissapoint you.  But, if you want the advantages of traditional cookware combined with easier cleanup in a durable, functional set, and are willing to shell out the $$$ for a top-of-the-line product then this is for you.  Serious cooks who need the correct tools will love this cookware\n'

aS"\tOlga Gill\n\tThis is a great thermometer, easy to use and very accurate. It is an essential tool in the kitchen for making perfect candy recipes each time. You should always test your thermometer in boiling water by reaching 212F or 100C before you use it. I like the clip that allows you to attach it to the side of the pot. It's easy to read and dishwasher proof. It's the best!\n"

aS"\tWonderful Product!\n\tMy dish for the holidays is always mini-cheesecakes.  It was always frustrating to get them out of my mini-muffin pan.  This pan has made it so easy!  I no longer dread making this dessert.  Just a note though... the cups on this pan are approx twice as big as a regular mini-muffin pan so adjust your recipe accordingly.  I just double my recipe and get bigger mini-cheesecakes.  I don't think anyone will mind\n"

There is a bagel button you press when toasting bagels and only the outside heating coils come on and toast the center of the bagel!  This is how I like them to be toasted.  The toaster also has a basket that holds the bread/bagel in place while it is being toasted.  This feature is really nice when toasting soft things such as pop-tarts.  Good variance of heat controls too.  I have not found anything bad on this one.  Good choice\n'

I did notice the timer has to be completely dark for the eggs to be done instead of the little light circle in the middle like is stated on the packag\n'

aS'\tCorelle Dishwear\n\tI love our new white Corelle.  It is so light and takes up much less room in the cabinet.\n'
p276
aS'\tBest purchase I have made\n\tWe love this thing.  The steamer takes up far less room for both storage and use than a regular standing ironing board.  We have a small house and not alot of wiggle room, so space saving is key for us. Also,I hate ironing; sleeves, collars and touchy fabrics can be a bear.  With the steamer I just drag the wand and go, so far easy as pie.  On some types of fabrics or clothing details I can see where a little touch with a traditional iron would be beneficial, but overall we love this thing.\n'
p277
aS"\tGreat Product\n\tPfaltzgraff products are always reliably good, the Pistoulet dinnerware actually makes me feel cheerful when I use it. The colors are great and the designs are whimsical. I bought two sets in different colors and mix and match which makes the eating experience even more fun. I want to start collecting all the fun serving pieces too. The only thing I didn't like was taking stickers off each piece in the box. That always makes me crazy, it should be against the law to put stickers on dishes\n"

But it is heavy.  And the handle gets HOT.\n\nSo, if you want a great pan and are willing to put up with the weight, hot handle, pick one up when it's on sale and you'l be a happy cook\n"

aS'\tPerfect little kitchen helper\n\tI bought a dozen of these from another retailer (at half price) and I love them! They are perfect for everything that requires a small size container.  I use the cups to beat two eggs, melt butter, heat up baby food (never heat food in any plastic), to serve ketchup or other condiments, store a small amount of leftovers, etc. By using the appropriately sized cup, I save a lot of space in both the fridge and the dishwasher.  I recommend these highly\n'
p281
aS"\tNearly Perfect\n\tLots of reviews already, so let's not waste your time:\n\nPros:\n- easy to setup (no waiting for charcoal or having to buy propane)\n- easy to clean\n- practical. U can use it indoor/outdoor\n- No flames, so it's quite hard to actually burn the food\n\nCons:\n- Doesn't cook the food 100% evenly. Noticed that the area around the thermostat is hotter. Not by much though, but you can notice the grill marks on the food stronger when near the thermostat\n- Doesn't get really really hot. If you're trying to cook Brazilian style (large chunk of meat), it might not work out. However, it's great if you cut it into smaller chunks of meat.\n\nOverall:\nI love this so much that some days I use this for lunch and for dinner. There are no pans to clean. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it's not even throughout the whole plate.\n"

aS"\tPerfect Grill for the Apartment Dweller\n\tThis little grill is not so little, with a large grill surface, but it takes up so little space on my apartment's patio - so it is perfect for those of us who only have a small patio or balcony. It is easy to use, easy to clean, and grills perfectly - no mess, no fuss.\n"
p283
aS"\tLove the plates but they arrived scratched\n\tI'm sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching.  My persimmon 16 piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched.  I think next time I'll order them as individual place settings as they weren't packed well.  Amazon will give me a 20% discount for keeping them.\n"
p284
aS'\tVery nice, durable and attractive\n\tI like this place setting color, but I have taken the advice of others and I use coffee filters between pieces for storage.  It is a great place setting\n'

aS"\tGreat timer!!!\n\tI've been using mine almost daily for cooking and/or laundry, and it is still running off the original battery after more than 6 months. The one small criticism that I have is that the buttons are too easily pushed, and I can't stick it in my pocket without stopping it or changing the setting somehow.  Other than that, it's ALL good..\n"
p286
aS"\tWorks well; just what I was looking for\n\tI bought this timer, because my husband wanted one similar to the one his mom had, with the big display and the simple, three-button operation. This particular timer was better priced than most I looked at, and I liked the extra large display. I have been very happy with it. The buttons don't stick like other timers I have used. I like the way the memory feature works, and the bonus feature that it can count up is also nice\n"
p287
aS'\tAlmost perfect\n\tI have used other egg cookers before, I like this one, but I am having to guess on the amount of water to get thew right soft boiled eggs.  Mine keep coming out almost hard boiled even though I use the soft boiled marks.\n'
p288
aS"\tStainless Steel is the best\n\tI love this tea kettle.  It not only looks great but is of heavy duty construction unlike those $10 aluminum throw-aways.  Since I am only an occasional tea drinker, I tend to leave water in the kettle and move it to hot burners when cooling (I have cast iron elements/electric oven so burners stay hot for awhile after use).  Other tea kettles create rusty water, since water remains in the kettle.  Not this one!  It boils water rapidly and is great looking on the stove.  My handle does not get hot and, like I said, I have cast iron elements which really heat up and remain hot.  I do agree that you cannot take the whistle off without an oven mit.  That's the only flaw; they should have made the whistle heat resistant like the handle\n"

aS'\tI love this pan\n\tI Love this pan and Size.\n I wasn\'t going to buy this pan at first, cause it was the "Simply", But I\'m not sorry at all...\n\n  I have alot of Calphalon Commercial (at least 20), and yes it\'s thicker, But I think this cooks very well.\n Being that this is abit lighter, I find when its filled up, its heavy enough for me, and easyier to handle.\n The price is also alot less then the Calphalon Commercial.\nSince you most likely would not use this pan everyday, I would think you would not need a lifetime warentee like the Commercial gives you , if you use it the right way.\n\n  I have sauted hamburger meat,onions, peppers ect. emptyed the fat off, added sauses, and continued cooking everything together, then puting this into the oven to finish it off..\nNever a problem.\n\n  I have used this for making Large Egg Omelets, the cheese has never stuck.\n Use it for fryed potatoes with low fat cheese, and I don\'t need to use alot of oil,\nThe nonstick works fine.\n I have used this for sauteing Pasta with sauses..\n \n This is a large size, so you can put alot into this and have left overs.\n You can make pancakes, frenched toast, I would think anything you want..\nI guess what I\'m saying is, you can use this size for anything.\n \n   I do have the Calphalon Commercial double gridle, but if you don\'t have room for all the peices that I have, this can cover alot.\n I have found this to cook even, and you don\'t need to turn your stove on high.\n\n This lid seems to fit fine, and its a bit domed. I don\'t have a problem with it.\nThe sides are stright up, and seems high enough.\nLots of flat space in the bottom.\n\n  Mine is also made in Ohio, not Japan, but you never know with some peices of Calphalon lately!!\n \n  This washes very easy.\nNever put any Calphalon into the dishwasher, altho this lid you could put into the dishwasher ( I don\'t tho)\n\n I would buy this again...I only paid $42.00 for this, so I did buy two of them, one for a gift.\n I don\'t understand Amazon\'s priceing , as sometimes the Calphalon Commercial can be less money!!\nSo I would say, take the time and check out your other options, as the Calphalon Commercial has more layers of nonstick and is a higher quality, but don\'t let that scare you off from buying this one\n'

aS'\tRowenta DZ 9080\n\tThis iron is a technological marvel.  I have just had it for a few days and I have ironed some very difficult, over 100 year, heirloom open-embroidered linen.  It was a breeze and the results were truly professional.  The controlls are easy to use, the steam settings excellent.  It just glides over those diffucult spots.  It may be a little pricey, but it is worth every penny.\n\nThis is an ideal tool for anyone who sews on home fabrics.  The upright steam feature is a plus.   I was concerned about the weight, but the iron glides so effortlesly that you do not notice the weight.\n'

aS'\tWe Love This!\n\tOk...the only thing domestic about me is that I live in a house.  Cooking is a necessary evil.  This waffle maker is the best!  We love staying at hotels w/breakfast bars just so we can use the waffle makers!  Two things I have noticed about this appliance...I have 3 kids and a husband that all love the waffles, so when we use it I am making a lot of waffles.  If it starts to appear the waffles are getting more crisp, dial down the heat setting one less than what you are currently set on.  We start out with a "4" setting.  I am in the habit of spritzing the grids EVERY time we bake a waffle.  If you miss between, the waffles don\'t stick, but it is apparent they don\'t slip right out as easy.  I have found that a butter flavored cooking spray gives the waffle more of a "restaurant" taste.  We use the box batters...there is no way in hell I would take the time to make the book mix...LOL.  I\'ve used more expensive mixes to store brand mixes ($1.99/box) and they all bake up great.  \n\nMy mom has the same unit and she pretty much echos everything I have said.  They will make extras and freeze them.  We never have extras at our house--LOL!\n\nI have decided to keep my waffler out on the counter, it looks very sleek next to my beautiful staninless Kitchenaid mixer, stainless rice cooker and stainless coffee maker.  And, I admit it, I throw all the mix into the mixer and let the mixer do the job for me.  \n\nClean up is a snap and we have enjoyed having this appliance.  BE SURE TO HAND WASH THE BATTER CUP if you don\'t want the writing to come off.  I have scratched mine with an ice pick to show the proper level.  Also, I have a small spatula on hand I use to spread the thicker mixes around (quickly) if need be.  I also hand wash the tray and just let air dry and wipe up the unit after each use.\n\nI just can\'t justify taking the entire family out to breakfast for $30-40 when we can make all the goodies at home.  We are also planning a suprise waffle bake for my son\'s teacher at school for his birthday with my waffler.  I will just pre-mix a ton of batter.\n\nWe have a family friend who we owe a belated wedding gift to and this is what we are going to get them.  I know they will enjoy it too.\n\nHappy cooking\n'

aS'\tcouldnt ask for better\n\tI totally love these pans... Next go round I would definately order more of the same,, as I am hard on frying pans, and love these immensel\n'
p296
aS"\tHands down this beats other manufactors\n\tPerhaps like you, I love silicone.  You can do anything with silicone.  You can fry, poach, make soups, and there is never a worry about heat.  Le Crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils, but their wood is unfinished, so unless you keep them oiled, they will age and spilter.  These you can remove the top if you like but the wooden handles are treated, and are water resistant.  \n\nIn addition to these being made for the long hall, their shape is unique.  I like that the shape is slightly angled, this makes it easier to run along the edges of a bowl.  I  have been so happy with my purchase of these!  I can't say enough good things about them.  I would recommend these over other manufactors, they are better made, and improve in others weaker areas.  A must have for your kitchen\n"

aS'\tKITCHENAID  food processor\n\tLooks good  Works even better Nice storage case for attachment\n'
p298
aS"\tVery good machine...enjoy the quietness\n\tI've had this processor for about three months. On the first day, I decided to make bread, and the dough blade suddenly stuck to the machine. When I called customer service to help me figure out what I did wrong, they told me that occasionally, this processor's dough blade fuses to the machine. I couldn't even get the containers removed to pack up because everything was stuck together. Fortunately, the customer service rep was really nice and sent out a new one immediately. I received my second new processor, and tried to make cookies. This time, everything worked fine, and the machine is quiet. I can even talk on the phone when using this food processor. I'm just glad that they exchanged the first one so quickly\n"
p299
aS"\tThe New Kitchen\n\tThe solid contruction and well machined lids make these a joy to use.  We didn't want high maint. type of cookware just a high quality, easy to use and maintain product that looks good on the pot racks but cooks well every day.  Boy we are impressed! These cook with even heat and the only negative found was that the lids fit so well you have remember to take them off befor the dish cools or a vacume can form inside requiring reheat to remove the lid. They are easy to clean and a dream to handle\n"
p300
aS"\tGreat Popcorn!\n\tI have never had a popcorn maker before and I LOVE it!  I didn't think that it would be any different but its great!  It so much healthier since there is no oil used.  It is fast and not messy at all.  Its cheaper in the long run to becasue a small amount goes a long way.  You can buy a large jar of popcorn for about $5 and its makes ALOT!\nThe only reason I gave it a 4 is becasue I vought this particular one due to the butter melter.  Even when I use soft butter it does not melt all they way.  I just melt it in the microwave while its popping.  NOt a big deal though, I'd buy this maker again\n"
p301
aS'\tNice large size kettle\n\tI purchased this for my Mom.  Her main criteria being a large size kettle.  She reports that she "Loves it" and that it heats up very quickly\n'
p302
aS'\tfabulous pans\n\tI received a blue set for Christmas and I love them. The stay cool handles really stay cool, even if you are cooking something for a long time. They are beautiful and  Iloev the way they feel. My Caphalon pans are now collecting dust in the back of the cupboard becuase I like these so much more\n'
p303
aS"\tGreat piece, but don't expect it to arrive quickly\n\tI have the tangerine one and I love it --  it's great for using in the microwave to make Rice a Roni and stuff like that.  However, my father ordered the Periwinkle one off of my wish list and it kept getting backordered --  for months.  We finally cancelled the order and I got something else from my wish list\n"
p304
aS'\tHandy kitchen item\n\tThese are thin, lightweight, flexible mats that are great for chopping things on and then picking up and folding up the edges to pour the food into a pot/pan. This thinness/flexibility has a "downside" too: I do agree with the other reviewers that these mats tend to curl up and not lay flat.  However,they clean up easily, the price is right, and I am happy with my purchase.\n'
p305
aS"\tLove it!\n\tSo glad I bought this turner! It's very flexible and I can get under and flip my omelette/pancake beautifully. I love how I can now scrape the pan clean (as hard as I want) without leaving any scratches. It's very easy to clean too.\n"
p306
aS'\tFinally, I have a real coffee grinder!\n\tAfter suffering for years with blade grinders and cheaper burr grinders, I decided to take the plunge and get the Capresso Infinity in brushed chrome. This grinder addresses all the problems I had with the lesser machines: it\'s fairly quiet, free of static, grinds evenly, and is easy to clean (although unless you use really oily beans, you shouldn\'t need to clean it very often). \n\nI don\'t make espresso, but I\'ve used it to grind coffee for moka pots, French press, and drip coffeemakers, all with great success.\n\nJust a note on its construction: the difference between the chrome versions and the ABS plastic version is more than just the finish or a metal skin. The chrome versions have a "zinc die-cast housing," weigh almost twice as much as the ABS plastic version, and are very stable.\n\nAlso, as usual, Amazon has inflated the price to make it seem like they\'re offering us a bargain when they\'re not. The list price on the manufacturer\'s website is $139.99, not $190. I got mine locally at Sur la Table\n'

aS"\tI love these\n\tThese are excellent!  Instead of reaching for a paper towel, I grab one of these (choosing a size that completely covers the top of the item I am microwaving), and then wash it when finished.  I did notice that the smooth side should be on top to prevent it from curling up when it gets hot.  I really like the fact that you can see through it since I couldn't see through paper towels\n"

aS"\tFiestaWare brings color to life\n\tThis is a great set of dinnerware!! After 25 years, my husband and I decided to bring some color into our lives by replacing our wedding gift white Corelle with festive FiestaWare. How lovely to open the cabinets and see color!!! We've mixed colors and have an eight piece display of color. FiestaWare is not only beautiful, but durable.  And it can be put in the dishwasher, microwave, oven and freezer!!! It may cost a bit more than some of the trendy stuff available, but it's adaptability to all uses makes it a fabulous value!!! If you are at all tempted by it --- BUY IT!!!! You will LOVE it! Put some color in your life\n"
p310
aS"\tGreat knife for the price\n\tI received this knife as a Christmas present and so far, I am pleased. What struck me first about this knife is how wonderfully sharp it is. I also own a Wusthoff Santoku (which I love, too) and this knife was just as sharp right out of the box as the Wusthoff was. It is rather comfortable in the hand and the shape of the blade allows for very smooth rocking and chopping action, which is wonderful when you are chopping vegetables. It is also wonderful for carving meats, with its long sharp blade. The blade is a little on the thin side for my tastes, however, but is certainly functional. The grip is also slightly larger than I would like, making it a bit more cumbersome to hold than my Wusthoff. But these matters are not that important considering the price of this knife. If price were not an issue and I had to choose between a Wusthoff and a Forschner Fibrox, then I would probably choose a Wusthoff. But being that a Wusthoff of this size would be at least $50 more, then price does come to play. If money is no object, then choose the wonderful German steel of a Wusthoff or look into the Japanese steel of a Shun. But if you are like most of us and have to consider price, then I do believe you will be happy with a Forschner Fibrox Chef's Knife.\n"

aS'\tKitchenaid is simply the best\n\tThis Whisk is far superior to any other I have owned. I cook constantly and a whisk is a necessary tool. This one is sturdy, reliable, and stands up to the most viscous mixtures. Kitchenaid is the way to go for all of your appliance and cookware needs\n'
p312
aS"\tCustomers Beware!!!\n\tI have spent thousands of dollar's, On Meyers cookware everthing from KitchenAid, Anolon, Prestige, Faberware,  and amp; Circulan, just to name a few. Though Meyers does manufacture very high quality pots  and amp; pans and I would recommend them to anyone it's just sad that if you have any problem with them, under warranty, you have to go throught the chain of command, that never gets you anywhere, even if you want to speak with upper management about the rudeness of the customer service department. Their customer service department employees are always very rude and snotty and they act like they are doing you a favor to even talk to you about their products. Don't get me wrong they do make good cookware, probably the best, but you as the consumer are at the mercy of their customer service and their descision or your fait on wheather your life time warranty is honored or not\n"
p313
aS"\tI feel like a star, now!!!!\n\tI ordered one of these, after seeing someone use a similar grill pan on a cooking show.  When I received the product, it was superior in quality.  Very heavy and extremely attractive.  I couldn't wait to use it.  I just wanted to get those little grill marks on my food, because I don't own an outdoor grill and I don't like the idea of dealing with mosquitos while grilling outside.  Not only did I get the marks, but I got the burnt grill flavor on my chicken breast, too.   The first night that I used it, I was having a dinner party while cooking.  It performed stellar on the first use.  I used chicken breast strips and noticed that though they seared with that great sound, they were cooking evenly and slowly.  The food didn't burn, but I had to cook it a long time to get the chicken thoroughly done.  The taste was perfect and not burnt or dry at all.  I was so excited that I cooked whole bonely breast two days later and can't wait to grill the shrimp and vegetables this weekend.  Beware though, the thickness of the meat will cause a lengthy grilling time.  So, the house will be full of smoke (for the inexperienced cook like me), but the meat will not burn or dry out.  I also purchased the heart shape pot which was great for display of the casserole but the grill pan has me walking on cloud nine.  Matter of fact, I'm eating grilled chicken for lunch right now and it taste great!\n"
p314
aS"\tGreat for the price\n\tThis is a great timer for the price, a little bulky though. It's nice to be able to set the timer for seconds, minutes or hours and also be able to count down or upwards. I'll use it as a reminder for appointments while I'm working in the office at home as well as in the kitchen. This will also be handy for soccer practice\n"
p315
aS"\tHighest recommendation.\n\tI've enjoyed mine for 15 years, my mom has enjoyed hers for 36 years, not sure how old my grandma's is, all still run great. Mixes breads, cookies, cakes, pancakes, hamburger and whips cream and egg whites effortlessly. Easy to clean. Some reviews have commented on the weight, my mom has had arthritis for a long time, and she still uses this all the time. Just leave it on your counter, it looks great and you're going to uses it every other day anyway. It is getting to be our standard wedding present and we have never had any complaints. Just feels good to have something so beautiful, reliable, well made and useful sitting handy on the counter\n"

aS"\tOutstanding quality and great price.\n\tThis cooking/serving stainless steel slotted spoon, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you'll prefer this product to the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries.\nIts elegant, stylized shape makes it perfect to use either in the kitchen or at the dinner table, and it also comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging, and a strong, stout neck guaranteed to be unbendable.\nOverall, this spoon is perfect to strain vegetables, fruits, shrimp and other foods, and its easy to clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hardwearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years. Furthermore, its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away. \nAfter submitting this product to over three years of normal, everyday use, mine is still just like new.\n--Reviewed by Maritza Volma\n"

aS'\tSwiss Diamond is a real jewel!\n\tWish I\'d had this pan years ago - it would have saved me at least a year in clean up time! Nothing sticks to the pan! It cooks beautifully  and  is well worth the price. With a lifetime warranty, super easy clean up, and utensil "safe", it is a great investment! If I cooked more often, I would buy the larger Swiss Diamond also.\n'
p321
aS"\tVery pretty roasting pan  and  impressive gift\n\tIf you have a good cook (or chef) in the family, this makes a very impressive gift.  It's a very nice looking pan that stays nice looking.\n\nMy only criticism of it is the lack of a non-stick interior.  You either will want to line the pan with foil before cooking anything that will generate a mess or where juices might burn, or you'll have to let it soak with a dryer sheet for a while afterwards.  The stainless doesn't retain messes so much as it just takes a bit of effort to get it completely clean.  But it's worth the effort - the pan cooks evenly, the rack is very sturdy.\n\nWorth the money.\n\nWatch out for the handles when they're hot - they don't fold down and it's easy to burn the underside of your arm or hands on them when you're moving it around while hot.\n"
p322
aS"\tlove this breadmaker!\n\tI am a great cook but not a good bread baker. This machine is a joy, a godsend, I love it. Easy to use, easy to clean and it never fails. Buy it now-you won't be sorry.

aS"\tWorked for sometime\n\tThis is my first oil sprayer so I can't say this is better than that or whatsoever. I bought it after reading the reviews here. It was working great for few days and I'm not sure how it happened but I saw a tiny hole on the plastic lid and obviously it couldn't hold the pressure anymore. I purchased it from target.com so I'm not sure about the return policy. I'll have to find out. But other than that it was grea\n"

aS'\tGreat value for the price\n\tSince I liked it so much, I decided to purchase a second one the day the first one arrived. Was very disappointed to see that the price has gone up $10 in just one week! However, the quality is good and I am satisfied with the item\n'
p325
aS'\tA "Must Have" for every kitchen\n\tI used one of these when I was a teenager working in a pizza joint to scrape dough balls off the pan so I could spin pizza\'s.  Until recently I never knew how versitile these things are.\n\nI use it constantly to keep my cutting board clean, scape rememants of one item off before chopping the next, I use the side to smash garlic cloves, use the rounded handle to smooth surfaces, and more.  This thing is versatile, not just for baking.\n\nFor the cheap price of this thing, no kitchen should be without\n'

aS"\tGreat Cookware Set!!\n\tMy husband and I bought this cookware set when we first got married  and  I absolutely love it!  It has a nice weight to it  and  the base  and  walls are thick, also the lids fit perfectly.  It heats evenly  and  I never have had any problems with food sticking to them.  Just make sure you don't use metal utensils with these or they may scratch the coating, and the only thing I don't like about these is that the oustide can get stained if you let a pan boil over or put it on a burner that is not clean (my husband used to put tortillas  and  bologna on our coil burner  and  now I have a stain on the bottom of my frying pan) but I'm sure a little barkeeper's will take it out.  All in all they're great  and  I highly recommend the\n"

aS'\tLOVE this!!!\n\tI wish I would have bought one a long time ago. It is so convenient. Easy to clean up. Very nice for grinding nuts in a hurry for baking. Seems powerful enough for everything I have tried it on. You still need to pull out the big food processor for larger amounts because this only holds 1 cup or so. That would be the only negative. Otherwise I love it.\n\nGreat product for the price. $14 well spent!!\n'

aS"\tGreat little gadget\n\tI received this grinder as a Christmas gift from my son-in-law after my cheapo, cheapo grinder went kaput! I am surprised at some of the not so happy reviews because we use this grinder every single day, sometimes twice in one day, and it works really well. \n\nIf the grinder is dedicated for coffee or spices, there's no need to clean it (like, with water and soap; just tap around the outside canister and all the excess residue falls off the edges into the cup/blade area. \n\nI really like the grinder, and knowing my luck, this Cuisinart will last a long time only because I've had my eye on a Kitchen Aid coffee grinder (to match the rest of my appliances) and just happened to get this one as a gift. Oh well! But, the grinder is worth the money, and it does what it's supposed to do. Unless you're the type of person who needs directions on how to breathe, this grinder is a no-brainer :-\n"

aS'\tGreat helping hand for making doughs!\n\tThis is my third handmixer in a year, finally got something exactly what I wanted.  Great value and powerful.  I highly recommended this product especially for those of u who need it for making different kind of doughs.\n'

aS'\tVery good scale but different model from advertised version\n\tThe scale I received from Amazon looks the same as the picture for the "Soehnle Vera White Digital Food Scale" but it\'s a different model. The one I received uses the CR-2430 lithium battery, not four AAs as advertised. Also, the product manual is different. The actual manual\'s title is "67000 - 67007 g/oz," not "8122/8123 g/oz." On the bottom of the scale, there is a number similar to Soehnle\'s product numbers, 812215. But I could not find such a product anywhere.\n\nFortunately, the maximum weight capacity of this scale is 5000g as advertised. It\'s actually about 5280g. The unit of measure is in 1g or 0.05oz increments. Weighing items with this scale is very easy. The LCD screen has large 0.5" numbers. It has a 2-minute auto shut-off switch, and a supposedly low-battery indication.\n\nOverall, this is a very good scale and I recommend it if you\'re willing to put up with purchasing a lithium battery once in a while\n'

aS'\tNot deep enough\n\tEven though its a 10" bowl, its not deep enough for salads\n'

aS"\tCuisinart is short-sighted\n\tI love my cuisinart prep 11 plus food processor.  Since I use it for all sorts of cooking, I have purchased all of the disks for it.  I don't want three or four different holders for disks, etc. because I don't have unlimited closet and counter space.  Since they sell a complete set of disks why, oh, why don't they sell a tower (small footprint) that will hold all of the attachments.  This is short sighted of them.  I have friends who have the same gripe.  If someone manufactures such a disk holder we would be interested in knowing how to contact that company\n"

aS'\tLET ME WHISK YOU AWAY\n\tBye whisking you away I froth, foam and easily handle all your whisking problems away. My handle is so secure it will absoutley amaze you with  its workability. Please try me so I can whisk you into my recipes, now\n'
p339
aS'\tDoes not have Pump and hose\n\tThe previous reviewer was correct. This item does not have the pump and hose for using it without a garden hose. I was easily able to order these parts and the clip to hold the pump from the Coleman website. Just look at the hot water on demand there and open the replacement parts link. \n\nOther then that it is still cheaper then Coleman and works very well. This will work great in our off the grid camping adventures.\n'
p340
aS"\tSo far, so good\n\tI purchased this product the day before going on vacation, so i didn't have much time to research.  I've owned it for 28 days, and it's been working fine so far.  I use small pellets, not flakes- so that's all i can rate it for.  It seems to work at the same times every day, and a uniform amount of food appears to drop.  It is not quiet, so if it is used in a bedroom, make sure you adjust your feeding times as not to be disturbed while sleeping.  I acually don't mind knowing when it's running, so if i'm around I can check on it's function. Time will tell if it's a great product- but so far, so good.\n\nI must change my review- I too had one of the battery contacts break off, and the unit became unreliable. I'd often have to remove and replace the batteries to get it to work again. I'd look elsewhere before buying another\n"

aS'\tMiracle Whips Never Been So Easy\n\tAs a long time critic of kitchen tools and ALL Miracle Whip applicators, I was skeptical when I was presented with this device. It uses the same "scraper/spatula" design that has been prevalent in the United States since the release of the Tupperware model R. At first glance I was not impressed with this tool. It was nothing flashy, although I must admit the red color was quite innovative. But, the real test would have to come when I put it into service. She wasn\'t as stiff as some of the hard plastic models I have tested, but not as floppy as most silicone models I have labored through. I would have to say it was a happy medium. So I dug right in and began making some fried wonton stuffed with Miracle Whip, and I must say this spatula sparkled. Pounds of Miracle Whip got stuffed into this little Asian number, and the spatula never failed. I knock off one point for the simple fact, that they don\'t offer a Miracle Whip branded version of this spatula. Now that would be really nice. Also, not quite strong enough to be used a tactical weapon, but quite suitable as a disciplinary tool\n'
p342
aS'\tfast efficient meat grinder\n\tUntil I purchased this meat grinder, I was grinding with a manual one.  It was a chore to set up and clean up.  The Pro MG-800 Professional Meat Grinder made the grinding easy.  It does not have to be clamped on the table.  Ground meat comes out nicely into a bowl underneath.  Easy clean up, fast speed, three blades interchangeable for the grinding.  I am totally happy with the product I purchased.  Also, on top of being an efficient grinder it is very compact that does not take much space for storing.   The advantage of having a grinder is I can grind my preferred cut anytime and know what went into the ground meat\n'
p343
aS"\tGreat all around pan\n\tMy dad originally bought one of these woks from lodge and we use it for everything. We can brown all sorts of meats for varying dishes. For Stir-frying it is incredible, nothing sticks to it and we don't have to  worry about even cooking. I have recently purchased one for myself and I  couldn't be happier with it. At less than 50 is is a great bargain. Another  great use for it is deep frying. It is a tad heavy so do not try to pick it  up and serve because it will very easily slip from your hands. Overall my  favorite cooking tool ever\n"
p344
aS"\tKitchenAid always has what you need...\n\tThere isn't much you say about a plasic cover, but I'll try...  These  covers fit securely over the bowl for kepting whatever you're mixing fresh.   You can also store anything in it like it was a tuperware (spelling?)  item.  I'd recomend having them around, because you'll use them!  These are  for the 4 1/2 quart bowl and are dishwasher safe\n"
p345
aS"\tNot bad!\n\tIt's sort of cheap, but it works quite well.  The water comes out clean, with no odd taste (which some filter systems can do)\n"

aS'\tExcellent for years\n\tI am buying a replacement that I had for 15 years. It still works but the light went off.  I never thought they were still making it. I tried recently 2 other brands that did not make it 1 month paid around $25. I gave up, I was still using my old Westclck  until today when I found this one on Amazon.\n'

aS"\tLarge and plush\n\tI ordered these towels in two colors mainly because the price was right.  But when they arrived I was so pleased.  They're larger than I expected and very plush.  I've washed them several times and they look as good as when I first opened them.  It's really nice to finally have towels that actually dry you off\n"
p350
aS"\tFabulous deal, great towels, nice and big, no fuzzies\n\tThese towels are great! I was surprised how large they are, but it's been a while since I bought towels, maybe all new towels are really big.  These towels are so absorbent, it's hard to tell when they've been used because the water just seems to disappear.  And soft, soft, soft...brand new out of the box they feel great.  Again, they're big, so a litle heavy, but they are wonderful.  These are an amazing bargain and feel very luxurious.  I don't know what towels those other reviewers said resulted in fuzzies, they must have been referring to another product, these towels are awesome, no fuzzies, they are very well made\n"

The Zyliss Scoop goes through cold ice cream very well and literally drops off the scoop into the bowl. Well worth the money. How nice to have a tool that works well. Like others, I've tried many scoops that did NOT work - frustrating!! Do yourself a favor: stop bending your soup spoons and get a Zyliss Ice Cream Scoop.\n"
p353
aS"\tbig and useful\n\tInitially I was very surprised by how large the tools were. They are much bigger than any tool I've bought previously. If you don't have much space in the kitchen, I'd think twice about buying these tools.  However, after using them I think they are quite sturdy and useful.  Eventhough they are large, they are not heavy and sometimes there size is quite helpful.  You can pick up a whole fried egg with the spatula, for example. I am happy with my purchace, because the price was good\n"
p354
aS"\tWow!\n\tI have to admit that I was surprised when the rolling pin arrived. I'm used to OXO quality, but this is over the top. It is a big rolling pin, with an ideal diameter. It is also heavy. It's heft helps keep it where it belongs, instead of bouncing around on the dough and making you work harder. It has a strong axle, which glides remarkably smoothly, even when the pressure is on. The hard non stick surface works very well, and does not pick up butter grease like some other coatings. The handles are simply the best I have have encountered. This is a very well designed kitchen tool that fully lives up to the  and quot;Good Grips and quot; promise of quality\n"

aS'\tBake and Serve Casserole Set\n\tI recently broke two of my favorite pieces of Corelle Baking and Serving Dishes. I looked on several sites and it seemed all I could find was the handleless French Style Corningware, which I have and find hard to use due to being without handles. This Bakeware has great handles and I love it. I love the Chutney on the side, I compared this price with ordering just two piece of the same thing in Abundance Design and the oblong baking dish separate and it was $10.00 more without the ramkins. This was a better value\n'
p358
aS"\tA must have for any kitchen!\n\tI bought this scale back in Jan or Feb. I needed one and after looking around for a while found that I liked this one the best because of its easy to read decimile display- pounds on one side, ounces (down to the tenth) on the other side. The lb/k switch is located on the bottom side of the unit and I don't find it inconvient down there. This scale also has a auto shutoff feature that helps save your batteries but has never shut off while I'm in the middle of measuring. Because of previous complaints to that effect when I first got mine I timed how long it would stay on ending up with close to 2.5 min before it did. I also love the look of the scale it is sleek and stylish, very clean lines and is easy to clean too, just a quick wipe down and I'm done. As a note to Alton Brown fans this is his scale of choice on Good Eats. The price tag may have you shying away but I assure you that its worth every penny. I would not trade mine for anything!\n"

aS"\tsmartbrew really is smart\n\tI've had lots of coffemakers over the years, and always had a problem pouring the coffee into a cup. It ran over the side and made a mess, unless you poured it very slowly. I saw this model a few years ago and decided to try it. It is great. I will never own anything else. I have been looking for one to replace my old one, only because the heating element is dirty/rusty looking (my wife doesn't like it). In fact I'm going to buy one right now on Amazon, as I've looked at a few stores and the new Black and Decker models I have seen,don't have the dripless pouring spout\n"
p360
aS'\tReally reasonable price and a great coffee maker!\n\tThis coffee maker is so simple to use any husband can do it!  And, it makes a mighty fine cup of Joe at that!  Shipping was free, and it arrived in perfect shape in a timely matter.  Highly recommended\n'
p361
aS"\tExcellent saucepan\n\tWhen I ordered this saucepan, I didn't realize how high the quality would be.  When I opened the box and first lifted the saucepan, I was immediately impressed with the weight and quality.  Each time that I use this pan to heat up foods, I am constantly surprised at how much less time it takes for those foods to cook.  Water boils very quickly.  Lastly, the engraved measuring lines for liquids are  extremely helpful.  All in all, the best saucepan that I've owned\n"

aS'\tGood quality so far\n\tHad this oven for about a month now, and very satisfied. Nice brushed stainless steel finish, solid construction. Was a bit larger than I anticipated, but still fits nicely on my countertop. The controls could be a bit more elegantly designed, but overall very pleased with this oven. My favorite thing about it is how FAST it cooks and toasts\n'
p364
aS"\tMy Gorgeous Cake\n\tI love this pan. It's a 10 + in my eyes.  When it arrived I washed it with mild soap and water.  Dried it, sprayed cooking spray and filled it with my cake batter and popped it in the preheated oven.  37 minutes later a gorgeous cake was baked.  I turned the pan over on a wire rack and my cake fell right out without one crumb stuck in the pan.  I'm going to give this pan as gifts in the future.  \nThis cake design is especially lovely when you dust the cake with powdered sugar and cinnamon..............\n"

aS"\tFeels like home\n\tMy mother is Korean and so I grew up using stainless steel chopsticks.  Apparently they're quite popular in Korean households...as well as stainless steel rice bowls.  You might have seen them, the ones with the stainless lids?\n\nAnyway.  These are just like the ones I grew up using.  There are some drawbacks (like the noodle comment made earlier) but it's not a product flaw.  Yes, wooden chopsticks are going to grip better, but they also tend to mildew if used repeatedly and have to be restocked.  Lacquer coated wooden chopsticks tend to flake after a while.  And besides, when eating asian food you don't really pick up individual noodles (which would have you slipping and sliding).  You sorta grab a large portion and bring your face close to the bowl and slurp them down.  I think the Japanese actually bring the bowl to their face instead.  Trust me...it all goes where it needs to.  \n\nThe main thing is getting use to their diameter.  These are much more slender than the wooden chopsticks you see in restaurants.  Not for the novice chopsticker\n"
p366
aS'\tGreat\n\tI love this rice cooker! It replaced one I had for many years,and was sure I would never find another I liked as well.  I was wrong. This rice cooker is absolutely the best. It has replaced the broken one hands down. The rice is perfect every time whether you make 2 servings or serve a crowd, it keeps it warm without ruining it and it is so easy to clean and store.  I would recommend this one to anyone that really likes rice and prepares it often.\n'
p367
aS'\tThis is a Bargin\n\tI had a Zojirushi NHS-10 and worked fine. I gave it to my sister-in-law...grin.\n\nLatter I decided I wanted another cooker and just came upon this. It seemed to cheap. I ordered it from Amazon. This thing is a DEAL. We usually cook between 4-6 cups of rice at a time.  It makes perfect rice, if you use the cup at 180cc..\n\nWe have 5 kids and been using this 2-4 times a month for last two years.\n\nI like it most of all as it has limited options and cooks only rice.\n'

aS"\tI never knew ironing could be this easy\n\tI had a Panasonic teflon coated iron before this.  I didn't have any idea how much easier ironing could be - teflon is way overrated!  Don't get me wrong, I still HATE ironing, but at least now its over a lot faster.  Plus, the iron is always at the right temperature for whatever I'm ironing, and its easy to fill with water.  The only thing I'd like is a retractable cord, but it isn't a real cause for complaint\n"

aS"\tThe most useful thing\n\tI bought my Vacu Vin set about 4 years ago and it's still working perfectly.  It's so easy to use and it does preserve the wine flavor for at least a few days.  We no longer have to finish a whole bottle in one sitting or risk a spoiled wine.  I've recommended it to a few of my friends and they all say they can't live without it now.\n\nFew things of note:\n\n* Even with Vacu Vin, the wine will start to change flavor if kept over a week.\n\n* You do need to pump a lot more than the instruction indicates.  Keep pumping until you feel a strong resistance.\n\n* Vacu Vin cannot be used for wines with fizz (such as Vino Verde, Champagne, etc).  The reduced pressure will suck the gas out of the wine and make it flat very quickly.\n\n* It's better to keep the bottle upright so there's no pressure on the rubber stopper (It does not need to stay moist like a cork).\n\nIts purpose is to keep a leftover wine until you finish it, and it does that quite well\n"

aS"\tGreat Sauce Pan\n\tI love to cook, and own several different brands of cookware, All Clad, Cuisinart, and Calaphone.  This sauce pan didn't disappoint me.  I love it!!  The pan has a wider bottom than most 2 or 2 1/2 quart pans.  This is great if you need to saute onions or peppers at the beginning of a sauce, or if you need a little extra room to stir something.  I am very, very happy with this\n"

aS'\tGreat Indoor Grill\n\tI have had my grill for a week, we\'ve cooked lean steaks on it, pork chops, and the other night we cooked hamburgers on it.  This is my first indoor grill so when one review mentioned the "George Foreman" grill was a bit faster, I was amazed I thought the Delonghi cooked pretty fast!!  Clean up was really easy and one MUST remember to preheat it.  I gather some have not.  And as to smoking I haven\'t had any but then I buy lean meats and put water in the bottom if I think the food will drip a lot of fat.  Fat dripping into the large tray in the bottom is what burns and causes the smoke.  I\'ve only used water once, with the hamburgers (no smoking).  This really is a great grill and large enough to be more than satisfying (actual cooking space is 15"x11").  Ease and comfort of use is amazing.  I highly recommend it!\n'

aS"\tGood coffee maker\n\tI got this for Christmas over a year ago, and it still works great!  I use it most every morning.  The coffee quality isn't as good as my drip maker - no pod coffee maker can ever measure up to a drip maker - but it's very easy to brew just one cup and with no cleanup (except to remove the used pod!).\n\nI agree with the other reviewer that the Juan Valdez coffee pods come in excessive packaging (individually wrapped pods inside a cardboard box), plus my grocery store doesn't carry them.  Any brand pod can be used with this coffee maker.  I use whatever's cheapest, usually the Senseo Douwe Egberts.  I buy either the dark roast or the vanilla flavored.  I prefer strong coffee, but even the dark roast pods aren't strong enough for me.\n\nI wish I had the black-colored machine because the white shows every single coffee stain\n"

aS"\tDoes some things better than others\n\tI've used my pan twice before reviewing. The first time was corn muffins and they came out really well. They muffins popped out with ease.\n\nThe second time I made lemon cupcake with white chocolate chips, and it was harder. The pan was hard to transport to the oven full of batter. Halfway through baking, the batter drips onto the oven floor, causing me to put a muffin tin under the pan. When baked and cooled, the cupcakes broke while popping out\n"

aS"\tA good little fan.\n\tThis little fan does just what I need it for. A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk. It clips on very well. I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on. I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation. That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful. My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration. There is too much especially on high speed. This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip. It doesn't bother me but might others. The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch. I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan. This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt.\nAll in all very good for my uses. If you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one's for you\n"

aS"\tWhat a difference this light makes!\n\tI suspected that a daylight spectrum lamp might be a complete hoax.  I work in an interior office with no view of natural light.  That's 8-10 hours a day in a room with flourescent lighting!\n\nWhen I would come in, I would feel foggy and depressed and unmotivated.  When I would leave, I would feel blinded by the light outside and out of sorts.\n\nSo I bought this lamp on a whim from a Sharper Image Store.  It comes with a brushed steel lampshade, but the store also gave me a white translucent vinyl shade which is what I wound up using.  The light is softly diffused around my workspace.  I can increase or decrease the intensity of the light using the dimmer dial.  And honestly, whether it's psychological or whatever, I feel SO much better since I plugged this thing in!  I am perky, motivated and when I walk outside, I don't feel shocked anymore.\n\nI would recommend this lamp to anyone who works lengthy hours indoors without natural light.  Employers, BUY THIS FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES-IT'S A GODSEND AND IT LOOKS COOL TOO\n"

aS"\tLightweight, Excellent heat distribution, Easy clean-up\n\tI'm thoroughly impressed by this set of inexpensive skillets: each of the three are the right size for my use:  Small skillet for nice round pancakes, larger skillet for general stir-fry, the griddle for bacon, eggs and toasting bread (with more than enough real-estate to cook two of three at the same time - could have crammed in the bacon but that releases too much fat).  \n\nThe best part about this entire set is that it cleans up so well - i'm coming from some lousy Tefal (remember when they were actually a premium brand with good quality? those times have long gone) which stained really badly, not to mention the nonstick flaking off after a couple uses.  I've even tried some of the el-cheapo calphalons (another premium brand going downhill) from amazon and they chip and wear fast right out of the box.\n\nI'm now a convert to farberwear - they are inexpensive and has really held up to the test of time (this is in reference to my stainless-steel set I purchased right after college 10 years ago - they're still going strong and is testament to their quality even if they don't have the name or pricing to show for it).\n"

aS'\tFloppy, but otherwise good quality\n\tThis pan is nicely made, and is fairly thick silicone - but when full, it is floppy and doesn\'t hold its shape on the sides.

I understand now why some more expensive silicone pans have wire "sleds" to support the pans\n'

aS'\tA solid no-frills toaster oven\n\tWe celebrated 45 years of marriage and a toaster oven has been a kitchen essential for all of those years. The Cuisinart TOB-50 is number 4. It\'s predecessor lasted for 24 years so it has high standards to meet and I\'m optimistist. We choose it for it\'s simplicity, solid feel, and size hoping for reliability and ease of use. In it\'s early months it is meeting our expectations. It is one of the most solid and basic that I\'ve seen on the market. The controls are solid and easy to use. It toasts evenly and you have the ability to control the darkness of the toast easily. My baking use has been limited but it does a good job of heating small portions that you don\'t want to microwave. The door and the hinges are solid feeling. It is a nice size without being too bulky. We store it inside a cupboard so size was an important factor. It will toast 4 slices of bread or 4 to 6 waffles depending on their size. It has a soft bell to let you know when the heating cycle is done. The crumb pan is easy to use making the unit easy to clean. The only "con" I can think of in this unit is that the shelf does not pop forward when you open the door so you need a hot pad or shelf pull to pull it forward safely\n'

aS'\tThey fixed the permanent-label problem. Great board.\n\tI\'d purchased the "big brother" to this KitchenAid cutting board about a year ago, so I understand the frustration of the reviewers who complain about the apparently unremoveable label. (It sounds petty until you try to scrape it off yourself.) The label DID eventually come off, but it did take a bit of muscle.\n\nSo I\'m glad to say that this board arrived, a month or two ago, with no sign of a nasty Kitchenaid label at all. No more wrestling with my kitchen equipment for ME!\n\nAnd, like the larger version of this cutting board, this one really is excellent. It really is non-stick, even when the board is wet (such as when you rinse off the tomato goop before you cut up the scallions). It cleans easily and quickly, and has no objection to the dishwasher. Plus, it looks pretty enough that I don\'t mind bringing it to the table, which is more than I can say for most non-wood cutting boards\n'

aS'\tNever an empty pad!\n\tWe purchased the pad for the senior cat in our house.  At 14, he is the oldest of 5 - all indoors.  We put it on the bed (his favorite daytime nap spot).  He loves it, but so do the other four.  They all try to squeeze in on it, with him, or take it over when he gets up.  It\'s never empty!  It has a bit of a "crinkly" noise but they don\'t seem to mind it after they try it. It seems to work great and very easy to keep clean.  The patterned side can be de-furred with a few quick swipes of your hand, following the direction of the fabric nap.  Good purchase and endorsed by all 5 of our cats\n'

aS'\tSturdy, high quality\n\tThese are well-made spoons, not junky at all, which is always a possibility with cheap, mail-order items of this type.  The steel is heavy-gauge, and all the edges are rounded and safe.  Good value and a good way to  and quot;top up and quot; an order\n'

aS'\tMakes The Best Coffee\n\tI have owned at least six other coffee pots and was never satisfied with home made coffee, so Dunkin Donuts was where I would head to on my way to work.  I got this coffee pot and I buy Dunkin Donuts coffee and grind it with the Proline Kitchenaid Grinder and it is the best coffee I have ever had.  Recently I had a kitchen remodel and the electrician showed up with his cup of coffee in hand from Dunkin Donuts.  I asked him later in the day if he wanted a cup of coffee and he was hesitant stating he did not like coffee from home coffee pots.  Well, I assured him he would love it. After having my coffee, for the rest of the week he never showed up with his own coffee, actually said, he preferred my coffee.  After the job was over, he saw my sister a few weeks later and he mentioned how he missed the coffee I made.  This is the best ever, perfect coffee every time and the perfect temperature.\n'

aS"\tQuite pleased.\n\tI love this mug.  \n\nPros:\n\n-The 20 oz. size makes it perfect for a college student sitting down to write a paper or read a book - or for that matter, anyone who will be seated for the next hour and needs some comfort while doing it.\n\n-The vibrant red is warming, comforting, and beautiful.  \n\n-This mug is not to heavy to comfortably hold, full of liquid, with one hand.\n\n-It insulates well so that fingers aren't overheated while holding it.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-This is not related to the mug itself, but the shipping costs are monstrous.  Buy at least two if you buy one - I wish I had.  It comes in a rather oversized box\n"
