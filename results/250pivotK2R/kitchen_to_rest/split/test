S"\tDon't use with batteries!\n\tThe design for using the DC adapter with LED Booklight is extremely poor. It is possible that I missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the DC adapter. But, it must not have been very big. I combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case. These were brand new batteries. There does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the DC adapter and so the power goes right into them. This is bad. Modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries.\n\nI had assumed that I could leave the batteries in so that when I was at home I could use the adapter, but traveling I would use the batteries.  Don't make this mistake\n"

aS"\tMy Pups Just Didn't Get How To Use This Product\n\tI was really hopeful about this product working.  I have four dogs, ages 2 through 8.  I tried and tried to teach them how to use this product, but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button.  They just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it\n"

aS"\tOld Technology Fat Separator\n\tOnce upon a time, not too long ago, they made and sold fat separators that permitted the juice to flow out from the bottom of the separator. This meant that the cook could harvest all of the juice, plus the tasty bits,  instead of, as with this product, having to strain the sauce first (for the  bits) and then sacrifice some of the sauce (a small amount to be sure),  lest the fat start to flow through the spout as well. This product is  really just a step away from spoon and ice cube, and not a big step,  considering that it's not a complete solution. If the cooks's purpose were  to collect the fat--e.g., chicken schmalz--free from juices, it would  present the same problems\n"

aS'\tNot to Impressed\n\tWorks well on carpets not to well anywhere else.  The hose attachment is horrible, the hose is about 4 ft long and stiff and is not permanently attached to the vacuum, and when you try to clean furniture the movement losens it and it comes off.  I have 2 dogs and 3 cats and I need to be able to clean the furniture.  Also when you could use the hose on something all the dirt piled up on the floor where the vacuum stood, it was not pulled into the bag. Very disappointed with it and would not recommend to anyone with pets.\n'

aS"\tKeeps coffe hot--that's its only advantage--poor performance and quality.\n\tPurchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it. The heating plate under the pot started to rust; the pot leaks every time it's poured; it's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it; the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months; and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water. We purchased this unit because of the Cuisinart brand and the stainless steel carafe. We will not purchase another\n"

aS'\tBe warned!  They do NOT fit securely over all 5qt bowls!\n\tI have a Kitchenaid model K5SSWH Heavy Duty Mixer and they do not fit over my 5 qt bowl.

aS"\tDoes non-stick refer to the packaging?\n\tEverything sticks to these pans! I cannot get OFF the potato residue and I'm probably just going to throw them away. \n\nThey are awkwardly heavy.

aS'\tLeaks, Leaks, Leaks!!\n\tI can\'t believe this is a Rowenta product! If you decide to disregard the reviews, here are some things from the owners manual (which I read before using the iron - and followed to the letter) to give you an idea how temperamental/high-maintenance this item is:\n\n*Do NOT use distilled water. You can use tap water - if it\'s not too hard (less than 12 grains - who actually knows this?). Softened water can also cause problems. Basically, if you use anything except bottled water, expect problems!\n\n*Empty the water from the iron after EVERY use. Failure to do so will result in leaking or spitting\n\n*Other than the Rowenta Soleplate cleaning kits (which run about $12), the only instructions/recommendations for cleaning the soleplate are what NOT to  use.\n\nI had a very inexpensive Panasonic iron for years - given Panasonic is not really "known" for this type of item, my expectations were not high. It lasted 7 years with no problems and was low and/or no maintenance. Don\'t count on the Rowenta name to equate to higher quality on this one\n'

aS"\tRemanufactured?  No Thanks.\n\tLove those Irobot products and everything they're capable of doing.  In fact, this was my third purchase, but my first remanufactured product.  What a headache!  The product worked correctly just three times, then died. Both technical support and customer service from Irobot were helpful and prompt, but still took weeks to resolve the issues. I tried a different way of recharging, which didn't work.  Then they replaced the battery, but that still didn't solve the problem.  Ultimately I had to send the product back, then waited more than a month for a replacement, which was on backorder.  Finally, they substituted a different model, and which works just as advertised.  I'd never buy another remanufactured model.  But I still believe in Irobot.\n"

aS"\tLife span\n\tThe temperature markings on this thermometer are not protected!  Over time the markings get occluded by grease and if you try to wash the grease off the markings come with it.

p18
aS"\tAnother casualty\n\tDiscount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use.  As a smoothie addict, shoveling a dozen or more ice cubes into the jar daily, I'm still looking for a machine that can go the distance (is a full year's use asking too much?).  The Braun burned out in the first 90 days, faster than my Black and Decker, Oster, even Hamilton Beach (though it lasted longer than Back to the Basics).  The best thing I can say for the Braun is that it doesn't have the impossible-to-clean push buttons (always look for a single switch, a knob, or a touch-pad).  Otherwise, their shavers have served me better, mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes.\n\nI'm going back to the beginning and giving the classic single-switch Oster another try, though I'm beginning to feel guilty about cluttering the landfills with more broken machinery and useless glass jars\n"

It only fits Hoovers with product #'s beginning U53.., U54.., U64..  I ordered it along with a new Windtunnel that has a Hepa system, since the product information stated that these 2 items were bought together by other people.  Unfortunately, it does not state that these people (now including me) have to return the hose because it does not fit all Windtunnels.  So be sure to check and doublecheck before you buy.  ..\n"
p21
aS'\tCute, but useless\n\tThis item is metal and looks like an old fashioned ice crusher, but it is so small that it is useless. Its only 9 inches tall, so if you are expecting a nice big heavy duty machine, forget it. I bought it because I missed the ice in the door of my old fridge, but after trying it several times, I sent it back. It is so small that you rap your knuckles on the counter. I dont think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it, so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it. I takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup, and about 2 cups to fill a glass. You need 4 hands to operate it: 1 to hold the lid, 1to turn the crank,1to keep it from bouncing all over the place, and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place  (it slides out and then the ice lands on the base). Then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice, you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass. I broke the glass the first time i tried it. It hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear, making it even more wobbly. But as I said in the begging, it IS cute\n'

aS"\tSome breakage may occur during shipment.\n\tThis sushi set is really nice. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't know how to ship ceramic properly.\n\nIn my original order, they sent it in a medium-sized box, with air cushions only on one side. Of course several of the pieces were shattered. So I requested a replacement via the returns website. \n\nThe second order was dispatched immediately and sent via next-day. That was impressive. What was not impressive was that this time it was sent in an even *smaller* box, packed so tightly that the air cushions had burst. Naturally this set was also shattered.\n\nFortunately, I hadn't yet returned the first order, so I was able to cannibalize some good pieces from the first set to complete the second. I'm sure their returns department won't like hearing that, but as I see it I've saved them the cost of a refund.\n\nNeedless to say I won't be ordering ceramic flatware from Amazon again.\n\nOnce again, I like the style of the set itself, and think it's a great deal for the price. I just recommend that you buy it somewhere else.\n"

aS'\tdont waste your money\n\tI have had this for 2years now and what a waste of money it has been. I have used this a few of times before I decided to toss them.  This set was a disaster.

p30
aS"\tFondue Failure\n\tI really thought I would like this product when I got it out of the box.  It's looks well made and looked easy to use.  I followed instructions and cleaned it throughly and put my recipe misture and miniture sausages in it to slowly heat and to use as an appetizer.  I put the the heat setting on warm as I was not in a hurry and I left the room for about 5 minutes.  When I came back there was mixture all over my cabinets, counters, etc. and what was left was boiling and sputtering like mad.  I later found out that no matter what heat setting I used it would over heat.  I cannot recommend this product to anyone I'm sorry to say\n"

aS"\tDO NOT BUY!  I'll sell you mine for $5.\n\tI've had to bring this back to Hoover 5 times in less than a year.\nThe belt for the self-propelled motor comes off ever other time I use the vacuum. The on/off button has been fixed 3 times.  It works when it wants to.  Even the guy at the Hoover store admitted that this piece of garbage is known for problems with the belt coming off.  I have nothing good to say about this.  I'm  a huge Consumer Reports fan but they missed the boat on this one. They need to update their testing over the long-term.

Water and steam everywhere, also the frother does not turn off, I tried so hard that the knob came off.  I was very dissapointed\n'
p36
aS"\tA dud!\n\tI got the machine yesterday and was so excited. I got it all ready to prime by following the directions, and it didn't work. After several attempts I called Bunn customer service thinking that I must be doing something wrong. When I talked to the customer service rep. he told me that the machine wasn't pumping hot water into the reservoir and that this was a common problem with the machine. I'm thinking for $200.00 this isn't right, and why hasn't the company fixed it? He was very nonchalant about it as if it didn't matter; just get a new one. This just isn't acceptable to me. There are many positive reviews so I'm sure if you get a working one than you'll probably be happy with it. As for me, I refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company isn't even trying to remedy. Therefore, I'm sending it back to Amazon for a full refund and buying the Simple Human coffee maker which has gotten great reviews\n"
p37
aS"\tGot 5 minutes out of it\n\tThis worked great...for 5 minutes. I tried everything to make it work again over three days. I finally contacted customer service and they said there is nothing else to do - send it to them and they will replace it. I'm glad they were responsive, but now I have to pay to ship the darn thing to Michingan\n"

aS'\tWater Reservoir poorly designed\n\tI too have experienced the water tank caving in and not working properly if you forget to take the water tank out of the steamer unit, and mind you, you must also remove the cap from the water reservoir even after you remove it from the steamer.  I have tried putting hot water in the tank in an attempt to regain its original shape to no avail.  I would not recommend buying this steamer for this reason\n'

aS'\tReceived wrong one THREE times\n\tI ordered the Pro 5 Plus three times and recieved the wrong one 3 times.  They kept sending the "Commercial 5 mixer."  In the meantime I have accumulated 2 shoping bags full of baking goods.  I have ordered many  "cookie" art books, along with many supplies as well as the Set of 3 Pasta Maker attachment for this mixer.  This has been going on since the beginning of December.  But no mixer!\n\nCalls end up in whatever country.  All they do is placate you with polite rhetoric and pat answers.  Which is their job.  But this does not address the major problem.  The problem is never kicked up to a higher level, researched, investigated and thus ending in a resolution.\n\nNow I see this model or its equivalent, in Costo.  Very cheap but with the steel attachments (whip, dough hook etc) like the Commerical one.  It looks like a combination of the Pro 5 Plus and the Commercial one.  And the model no. is not listed in KitchenAde\'s website.  There seems to be something amiss with this Pro 5 Plus model. \n\nThis has been a frustrating experience.  I now plan to order the Pro 6 instead, which Cook\'s Illustrated listed as number one.  And it won\'t be from Amazon.  Receiving the wrong one three times is a bit much.  Dissapointed in the service.\n'

aS"\tWhat a Disappointment\n\tI used this maybe a dozen times before I stopped using it out of disgust. The surface is fragile and hard to clean. I reheated pizza and the residue stuck so tightly it could only be scraped off with extreme care. I did a bone-in slow roast and the weight alone pierced the surface so the juices bled into the matting layer. What's the point if you can't clean it or let anything harder than Jell-O come into contact with it. \n\nJust to clarify--the mat was used to line an airbake cookie sheet for the pizza and to line a baking pan with the roast atop of a bed of carrots and celery. I like my pizza crisp yet moist so I reheat it in a skillet when I can. I bake thin or drier pizza on an insulated sheet to keep it from getting desiccated. When I make a roast--I don't need any gravy. I slow roast the Alton Brown way and the juice stays in the meat rather than ending up in the bottom of the pan. The meat literally makes its own au jus in your mouth. I put a bed of vegetables on the bottom to further reduce the heat transfer from the pan to the meat.  Not cooking for a crowd?  Try a 3 inch thick steak (stood on end) cooked this way. You won't want to share. I don't slow roast turkey but it only takes 2-1/2 hours to do a 14-16 pound bird if you temper it properly. My sister always gets comments on how moist and juicy it is. \n\nIn fairness, when I gave my neice two of my unused large pastry/baking mats, she used them successfully to make her chocolate dipped strawberries, turtles, etc.\n"
p61
aS"\tBoils fast but this is a flawed kettle\n\tWell reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst. \n\nWhile you learn how to not get scalded, this kettle is always at least slightly irritating.  There are better kettles around\n"
p62
aS"\tA bit disappointed\n\tI purchased this item to be able to grill during the winter months when it's too cold to be outside.  It looks very nice and clean up is super easy.  The problem seems to be in what you decide to grill on it.\nThe first time I used it, I grilled chicken breasts and they turned out fine and by keeping water in the drip pan, I had no problem with smoke.\nThis is great, I thought.   The next time I grilled hamburger patties and even though I followed the same procedure as before, it smoked up my whole house. (these were not high fat content burgers either)  I added more water to the pan thinking it may have not been enough and it continued to smoke even more.  It was not a pleasant experience.  Right now it is sitting on top of my fridge and it may stay there until I decide to give it one more try.  If it fairs better next time I will return and give it a better review..maybe\n"

aS"\tNot nonstick\n\tWe had registered for All-Clad pans for our wedding last year, and decided to go with a Calphalon commercial nonstick set instead.  The person helping us highly recommended the Calphalon One infused anodized set instead, and said the demonstrations he had seen were fantastic.  We bought that set and have had it for nearly a year.  We hardly ever use it, however, because things stick so badly, even with oil.

Not washable, end plate falls off while cutting all the time, unit slides over the counter when trying to cut (rubber feet would have cured this).  I would look elsewhere before buying this unit\n'

aS"\tGreat Value BUT!!!\n\tThe 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor. The mirror finish doesn't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water. The bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd. When 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds. I didn't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set. Finding everything that I needed and used was more important. The set does heat evenly and cook well it's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore. This product is great if looking for style and going to hand it up over an Islan\n"

aS"\ta piece of junk!\n\tDon't waste your money. I bought this because it was small and I wanted a rice cooker that would make 3 cups and take up less storage space than the bigger ones. \n\nIt burns the rice every time no matter how much I adjust the water ratio. And brown rice - forget it, even more burned on the bottom. You have to watch it instead of being able to rely on it doing what it says it will do. It has yet to turn out 'perfect rice.' \n\nIf I could rate this a zero I would\n"

aS'\tNot for tomato-based sauces\n\tThe interior of this pan got discolored after the very first use. It got yellow stains from cooking tomatoes in a little bit of oil. A lot of scrubbing and a cycle in the dishwasher lightened the stains, but the pan never got its new look back\n'

aS'\tToo Messy\n\tBought this grinder after my Capresso grinder developed a crack in the plastic housing.  After using for about two weeks, I have to agree with other reviews that mention "static problem". The grinds cling to grinder and coffee end up all over the counter when trying to pour into coffee machine.  The plastic cover also somewhat awkard to get on and off.  \n\nI would not recommend this grinder\n'

aS"\tVery disappointed\n\tThis product had the best reviews but the performance was not at all very\ngood. I found it very awkward to roll the litter box. You still have to\nbend down and tip the litter box all the way over to get the clumps\ninto the pull out tray. And that's the clumps that aren't stuck in the\nlitter filter piece, which gets easily clogged and is not really\nsomething I want to deal with cleaning. Besides not all clumps going\ninto the tray, lots of unused litter ended up in the tray as well.\nAlso, I bought the 'regular' size one and the filter piece goes almost\nright in the middle of the space so the usable cat space was very\nsmall. Needless to say I returned the litter box and was so glad to\nhave the old fashioned scoop litter box\n"

aS'\tLight intermittent household use at best.\n\tStainless-steel and die-cast aluminum construction promises performance, but the undersized electric motor limits this slicer to very light intermittent household use. The Waring FS800 Pro Electric Food Slicer seems to have a barely adequate motor when brand new with a new sharp blade. Just think how it will perform when the blade gets a little dull. This is definitely not a professional quality food slicer, it is only a light intermittent duty slicer at best\n'

aS"\tNO SUCTION and terrible customer service\n\tI used my Hoover Agility for the first time and the suction quit after 5 minutes. I followed all the trouble shooting instructions and it still didn't work. I called Hoover and spoke with a rep who was basically reading out of the manual. I sat on hold for 21 minutes only to hear a manager tell me that they cannot give out technical information because it's against their policy. I guess this is to ensure their Hoover service centers get the business. I'm returning the Hoover and NEVER purchasing a Hoover again.\n"

aS'\tExtremely Unsatisfied\n\tWe have not been able to use the sheets because they are so stiff and rough.  They are wrinkled and no matter how many times they are washed they do not soften.  The pillowcases are too narrow for our regular size pillows which makes the pillows too high and hard to be comfortable. We are totally dissatisfied and thoroughly disappointed and will be returning them if for no other reason than to get them out of the house.  We do like the color, though\n'

aS'\tsave your money\n\tI was so excited to buy these sheets as my husband and I have 600 thread count sheets that we love. These, I DO NOT love so much. This is why:\n1. They are increadibly stiff. I washed them 5 times before my first use and even tried vinegar and salt washes to soften them- it did not work. They are, however, softening as we sleep on them.\n2. They are so wrinkley!!\n3. They barley fit the bed. The description says that is fits extra deep mattresses but it is a STRUGGLE to get them on my bed.\n\nI just read consumer reports and they recommend that you buy between 400-600 thread count, they contend more than that is unnecessary for a soft, nice sheet. My 600 thread count sheets are much more soft and have very few wrinkles. Dont waste your money, buy something else\n'

aS'\tDisappointed\n\tAfter cooking eggs this morning and having a layer of egg stuck to the whole pan, I\'m sad to say that my non-stick pan sticks.  We\'ve had this pan for maybe 8 months and I just assumed that pans lasted for several years.  We even bought this pan plus the 8" for my mother-in-law for Christmas.  What a disappointment.  Better begin research on a new pan...and I\'ll make sure to read the reviews.\n'

aS"\tBought Two, Both Cracked\n\tI purchased this as a Christmas gift in early December. It didn't ship until February, which was okay. By then I liked the way it looked so much, I bought one for myself. They both arrived within a week of one another. \n\nBoth boards were treated with heated food grade oil and allowed to sit and soak it in. After wiping off the oil, my board had surface cracks, where the oil had pulled some of the glue out from between the bamboo pieces. Within the first month of use, both boards developed cracks all the way through them. Both boards were never soaked in water, but just wiped with a damp cloth.\n\nThis board may be beautiful, but it quickly became unusable and a waste of money. Now I'm looking for a good hardwood cutting board. (I've already replaced the gift board with another.) \n\nAll in all, this fiasco of a cutting board has cost me around $150...and I have yet to replace my board\n"

aS"\tThe worst food processor ever\n\tThis chopper, if you can call it that, is terrible.  I've tried chopping all kinds of foods from veggies to fruit to nuts to cheese.  I've tried filling up the bowl, half full and barely anything at all.  It doesn't chop.  Plain and simple it just doesn't chop the food.  I've had pieces of vegetables get stuck on the blade.  Then, I'd have to stop and remove the piece and try again.  It started to chop a little a couple of times, but then just stopped and the blade kept spinning while chopping nothing.\nIt was horrible and I've opted now for a bigger 7 cup Kitchen Aid or Cuisinart processor based on reviews here.\nLesson learned, you get what you pay for\n"

aS"\tOne of the worst products I have ever seen\n\tThe V2 is one of the worst built appliances ever especially at about $250. Without exaggeration I have been back to the parts dealer about 10 times for replacement of the front suction piece (breaks), a number of times for the clear water and soap dispenser assembly. It seems to fall apart, leak, and requires constant attention. I now have to go to have a repair of the brushes - they don't rotate. And this is with use maybe once a month. Frankly, I'd be embarrassed to manufacture and sell a product with such miserable (and expensive) quality\n"

aS'\tbad quality - a review after long term use\n\tI brought T-fal pans from my local Sam\'s Club wearhouse, and initially, the pans worked great. this is my review after about 1.5 years of use:\n\n1. the handle on the lid (plastic) broke after about a year. \n\n2. the non stick coating began to crack from regular use in about about 6 month, and it got so bad that i tossed the pan out in about a year and half. \n\n3. the handle broke twice on me and for both time i super glued them back on. on the third time, i just tossed them out and got an expensive Anolon titanium non-stick set. \n\n4. the pan is not made of aluminum and there are "hot / cold" spots on the pan. the hot / cold spot is caused by uneven distribution of heat. a good pan, generally with copper or aluminum core will evenly distribute heat. this pan does not. \n\nbottom line: \n\ndo not use this pan in the oven eventhough the instruction said up to 400 degrees. the handle will and did crack on me for 3 times with occasional oven use.\n\nthe pan is thin, and does not distribute heat well. and the worst: the non-stick coating is a joke. \n\ni found out that it\'s actually cheaper to get a expensive set and use it for like 10 years instead of getting a cheap set for a third of the price and replace it every 2 years or less. \n\nnot recommended.\n'

I used it a total of 10 times and not for long periods of time and it literally died.  I sent it back to the factory asking for a refund and they refused and sent me a refurbished one in return - they will not refund your money on the poor quality items they sell.

I would return these sheets, but they are a gift for my mother, and since they took so long to ship, I won't have time to get her anything else! I have never had a bad experience with Amazon products, some of the third party sellers could be better, but usually Amazon it's self is pretty good. Not in this case!

aS"\tCan't imagine anyone liked this thing.\n\tI hate to iron and despise the cost of dry cleaning...so, I was really excited when I saw this steamer at CVS.  It was reasonably priced and sounded wonderful.  I was bragging about how much I loved this steamer after using it just once!  It was easy and fast....then, the second time I used it---Water everywhere!  \n\nWater started to spit and spray out of the (sealed and closed) base of the steamer.  I had turned the top to the locked position...but, the black rubber ring (supposed to keep the thing sealed?) was all twisted up---explaining why it wasn't working.  Well, I fixed that rubber thing back into place, but it still kept spraying boiling water.  SO, right now it's sitting in the corner waiting to be thrown out.  \n\nI'm very frustrated with this product, but love the way that clothes steamers work.  It looks like I'm going to have to bite the bullet and buy an expensive one.  But, how expensive should these things be?  All they do is boil water and shoot it out of a nozzle, right?\n\nThis product is a waste of time and money...I can't believe that there were any good reviews.\n"

aS"\tA Big Fat Joke  and  A Waste Of Money\n\tI am a trained research assistant; therefore, I try to research products before I purchase them.  In the case of this purchase, I saw the item during an early bird sale at Kohls, so I grabbed it.  I owned a professional steamer that was purchased at a store that was going out of buisness, but it is really bulky, so I thought that the compact steamer would be a great choice.  On the contrary, it was a big waste of time trying to dewrinkle a blouse, and although it was on sale, it was a waste of money.  The problems I had were:\n\n1.  The cord is too short: directions instruct user to hang nozzle on the door hook which hangs over the top of any door.  The nozzle would not reach to the top of the door, and I live in a mobile home, so it is not like I have the tallest doors in a home.\n\n2.  The most important thing in steaming a garment, for me, is to avoid the garment getting wet.  I did not fill the steamer to the maximum line, because I know from past experience that this could sometime cause the spitting affect.  After 2 minutes of waiting for the steam, I began to try it out on a silk blouse, and what a big mistake I made.  The water spat out on the material.  I thought that I should not hold the nozzle so close, but it did not matter, because water continued to spit out on the blouse.\n\n3.  The steam pressure would not dewrinkle the blouse.  The is not a case where the material was so hard to dewrinkle; it is silk, not that hard of a material.\n\nI have read other reviews, and if this machine worked for them, I don't know how, but I can attest to the operation of the steamer that I purchased.  I dabble in selling clothing on another website, and I have owned my other steamer since 2002, and I will continue to use it; I will just have to deal with space that it takes up in my home.  Conair GS4 Compact is a bust.\n"

aS"\tHigh Priced - Low Quality\n\tVery disappointing!  Spend your money somewhere else.  I threw away a perfectly good but old made in the USA Thermos bottle and bought this made in China Nissan 0.79-Quart Stainless-Steel INSULATED Bottle back in June of 2005.  Ten Months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it - evidence of the loss of its insulating function.  I think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which I think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside.  When you spend $25 one would think it's a good quality product - Think again\n"

aS"\tBig and Leaky\n\tThis is a neat idea ruined by shoddy manufacturing. First of all, this coffemaker is a lot bigger than most regular ones, especially the height. I can't fill this one without pulling it all the way out to the front of the counter. This takes up a lot of room for small kitchens or crowded countertops. The whole thing is also made out of plastic with a very cheap look and feel as soon as you take it out of the box. In just about 3 months of daily use, I've already had water or coffee leak out of the dispenser four times. Between the constant waste of space and having to watch out for leaks, I'd rather go back to pouring my own cups. The only reason I haven't thrown it out is because my wife bought it and I don't want to hurt her feelings\n"

aS"\tWorks great, at first...\n\tI have had this product for about 2 years.  When we first got it, it worked great--lasted about 10 min. at a time.

Also, the clip which holds it to the base just broke, and I see that I am not the first person to experience this problem.

aS'\tThe Chemical Smell is Real\n\tAfter reading the reviews here saying that the chemical smell mentioned by others was not a problem for them, I went ahead and ordered this rice cooker.  After I received the cooker, I was a little disappointed to find that it was made in china, rather than japan, and that there were some very noticeable imperfections in the fit and finish.  \n\nI made sure to remove the shipping paper under the pot, and wash the pot and lid thoroughly, but upon trying it out I was disappointed to find that my cooker did in fact emit an acrid chemical smell that filled my apartment.  It was the kind of smell that you more feel in your nose than actually smell.  The smell also flavored the rice, which was most noticeable after letting it cool and airing out the apartment. Aside from this problem, though, the rice, which was standard japanese style white short grain, came out perfectly.\n\nI returned this cooker and ordered the Panasonic SR-NA18, which should arrive tomorrow.  I have compared a few rice cookers at my local asian store, and this Panasonic model seems better built than the newer (I believe) Panasonic SR-LA18, plus I believe it is made in Japan (I\'ll have to check when mine arrives).  I also highly recommend the Zojirushi 10-cup "Neuro Fuzzy" model (NS-JCC18/NS-ZCC18).  My parents have had one for several years and it works perfectly\n'

aS"\tOne KitchenAid Attachment to skip\n\tMaybe I just don't understand what this is supposed to do.  KitchenAid attachments are usually wonderful enhancements to their basic appliances.  But I haven't been able to create volume or foam in drinks with this attachment.  Can't see that it does much more than a spoon, and certainly doesn't do as much as a plain wire whisk.  It's not portable like those cheap, little drink mixers.  When I'm at home, I have my immersion blender  -  a much better option for mixing liquids.  Maybe this is good for something I haven't tried yet\n"

It even looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited. \n\nOn the fourth use, the brush abruptly stopped rolling and the motor started smoking. It cost me over $100 to repair. Beware buying this vacuum; repair shop owners will laugh when you bring it in because they see so many of them with broken belts and motors. Ignore what consumer reports says on this one and most definitley do not throw your money away on this piece of junk\n"

aS'\tYuck!\n\tFirst of all I\'m a Dyson fanatic....I have a total of three (one on each floor).  When we bought our cabin I couldn\'t stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one (they are pricey) for carpet I\'m on five or six times a year so I bought this.  At first I was thrilled.  It was wonderful.  After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction.  Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt.  I would doubt that it\'s on except that it\'s noisy and takes off without me.  I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked.  Also the "dirt container" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it\'s catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I\'ve never had a worse vacuum.  I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing.  To me "Hoover" spells "DISAPPOINMENT"\n'

aS'\tPiece of Junk!\n\tThis is the WORST vacumm cleaner I have ever had! It has continually broken down since I bought it and is now again dead. It\'s only 1 1/2 years old! While under warranty (the first year), I went through 5 belts, a roller brush, and the motor burned out. It is no longer under warranty, and of course, it broke down again. It smokes like it\'s on fire, and I believe that it\'s the roller brush *again*. Now mind you, my house is only 1600 sq ft, and half of that space is wood flooring, so I don\'t have an excessive amount of carpet. Nor do I vacuum excessively. Maybe once a week. I complained to Hoover and they basically told me "too bad". And it\'s not like it\'s an inexpensive vacuum at $289! \n\nI will never again buy a Hoover product\n'

To get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like 14-15 minutes--still faster than a fridge though. Also, the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs, "no messy ice". I thought you just use these freezer packs and thats it--note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using. Also, you still need to add water and the freezer packs don\'t really last that long. If you want to chill more than 1 bottle, I ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent. Its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink can/bottle will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water. Also, if you are chilling allot of beverages, there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts--they should put a drain spout at the bottom--I had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink. It does work being faster than your fridge or freezer, but the companies performance claims are a bit exaggerated\n'

aS"\tDoes not live up to function as claimed\n\tI bought this thing due to my inablity to handle heat effectively anymore like I used to. The unit was not deffective or anything like that, but it also only works under very specific conditions and that window is small. While it is stated in the manual that it's not an A/C unit or super powerful and that it works off of evaporation. I found it to be nothing more than an inconvienance than effective. The fan at the back of the unit doesn't have enough power to move the lightest of feathers let alone allow one to feel anything. While the manual claims that the fan is for cooling the back of your neck I find it is more functional to the evaporation chambers. Overall, the unit just keeps your neck wet and doesn't really cool anything. I found that the unit did work a little more noticably if it was not that hot out and you stood still. Anything over 85 degrees and it fails.\nDon't waste your money on this thing until someone comes out with a better system\n"

aS"\tmelitta products are inferior\n\tI received this grinder because I had purchased a defective Melitta Grind  and  Brew coffee maker through Amazon.  The coffee maker had electrical problems and I sent it back to the manufacturer as the manual instructed.  To make a very long story short---Melitta was not able to replace the coffee maker.  They stopped making them.  Amazon had my money and I waited over 4 frustrating months for a coffee maker.  Amazon would not help me and after many, many phone calls Melitta sent me another coffee maker and the coffee mill to compensate for the Brew and Grind.  Grinder malfunctioned periodically and finally died with in 9 months. WARNING--DON'T BUY MELITTA PRODUCTS AND RETURNS FOR DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO AMAZON.\n"

aS"\tGood company, bad product\n\tI, too, am SO disappointed with this product. When our DeLonghi toaster oven died after 15 years, my husband and I went shopping for a new one. Numerous reviewers and salespeople informed us that DeLonghi toaster ovens just weren't as good as they used to be, so we decided to try the KitchenAid oven. It appeared to be solidly built and was a brand we'd always been satisfied with. The oven, which was bought from a major retailer, looked fine, but the timer and bell were out of synch. Even worse, while the top coils heated up nicely, the bottom ones heated very unevenly. KitchenAid Customer Service was friendly and helpful and offered to send a replacement oven along with a mailing label so we could return the defective oven to them at no expense. Less than a week later the new oven arrived. It looked perfect. But again, it didn't work. This time the top coils glowed brightly while the bottom ones barely heated up. After preheating the oven for 5 minutes and positioning bread for toasting exactly as instructed in the owner's manual, we found that the oven produced a piece of toast that was beautifully and evenly golden on top and absolutely white on the bottom. Now we'll have to return this oven as well, and we've pretty much given up on getting a KitchenAid one at all\n"

aS"\tFunction Fails to Follow Form\n\tLike most reviewers, I found these glasses to be elegantly modern and sleekly minimalist.  Like a number of other reviewers, I found that one of my glasses leaked.  Unlike one other reviewer, I was unable to eliminate the water between the glass' walls in the microwave, and when I tried to do so the glass became very hot because of the steam produced.  To my mind, elegance of form can never compensate for a failure of functional design.  5 stars for form, 1 star for function:  2 stars total.\n\nAddendum:  I liked the form of these glasses so much that I bought two more at my local coffee house, knowing that if either leaked I could easily return it.  Neither did, and they're a pleasure to use.  I recommend local, rather than web, purchase\n"

aS"\tbroken after one use!\n\tI got this pasta maker as a gift, and after the first use the knob used to set the thickness of the pasta broke off and so did a piece of the handle used to turn the rollers.  All it would make after that is a flat piece of pasta with varying thickness.  The company is going to charge me to send it to them and back, even if they decide to exchange the product, and all correspondences must be done by mail (no call-in number) so I'm not even hopeful for an exchange\n"

The T-Fal toasts very evenly and I can fit a whole frozen pizza in it!\n\nThe bad part is that after about 2 weeks of service, the controls work only very intermittently.  This means that all functions behave at their default settings--no temperature or time adjustments.  Luckily, the default setting for toast is just barely on the brown side for us, still edible.  It's annoying to have what is otherwise a fine oven so befouled by unusable controls.  It would have received a 5.\n"

Despite following these instructions the push button still sticks.  To get the lid to close now after I'm done pouring I have to release the button and smack the top of the carafe.  Very poor design in my opinion.  I wouldn't buy another Zojirushi product based on this experience.\n"

The Coffee was good but the tea was not. Most importantly people is IT IS WASTEFUL. WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE, AND IN OUR CASE TWO MACHINES IN THE DUMP. COME ON PEOPLE LETS HAVE SOME CONSCIOUS COMSUMERISM AND SLOW DOWN. What ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you.

aS"\tSmoothie No More - What a waste of good tequila!!\n\tI had this machine for about 3 years with no issues. But, how often do most people use their machine?  I used it maybe 15 to 20 times.  I went to use it yesterday and all of a sudden I see smoke and the bottom of the machine and that funny electric smell (We all know what that smell means) The plastic bottom of the base stuck to the machine and margarita's were everywhere (except in my glass).  We had to throw the whole machine out.  Now I will be buying a new machine, being that I enjoyed the convenience of the spout but if I can't find one thats non plastic I will use my blender.  The smoothie maker makes less of a mess for drinks, a blender always doesnt pour as nice. I will not buy another plastic model again.  (I believe this one was a gift to me)  Do yourselfs a favor and spend the extra cash on a metal version or even glass if this exists, obviously the motor doesn't last long and the plastic parts break to fast according to other reviews I've read.\n"

aS'\tGreat idea, poor quality\n\tI bought the Back to Basics 600 smoothie maker about 6 months agos.  I was pleased with it until the plastic toggle on the spout broke.

I will look for a better quality one next time\n'

aS'\tGodzilla\n\tWe never even plugged this sucker in.  I wanted a countertop convection oven that would accomodate a pizza or 9 x 13 pan, and this unit was supposed to do that.  What none of the product decscriptions mentioned is that this "countertop" unit should NOT be used underneath a cupboard.  Don\'t most kitchen countertops have a cupboard over them?  Also not mentioned is that the unit required a 4" clearance on the sides: so whatever the dimensions of the unit are, you need to add 8".  I\'m sending this monster back and getting something smaller\n'

aS'\tMisleading Advertising\n\tI bought this product because the box says "no more ice chunks." There is even an "icebreaker" setting.  I wanted a way to make slushies.  However, the manual says you are to use the "icy drink" setting when crushing ice.  I am not sure if or when a person is supposed to use the "icebreaker" setting!\n  Also, the whole ice crushing process requires many steps and more than a blender.  First, you have to pour water in before you can crush the ice.  Once you press the "icy drink" setting, you pour out the excess water into a collander.\n  Even after all that, there are chunks in the ice. No slushie for me!\n  I gave this product just 1 star because I hate misleading advertising.  I will now have to take time out of my crammed schedule to return this product\n'

They dont mention about the base being a wood plank either. \nI have used a Simplicity machine earlier and hence i know the quality of steam press but this machine is a waste of time and money. I would rather buy a normal iron to this or pay extra and buy a better one. But this is just my opinion\n'

aS'\tBeautiful item but not functional\n\tI researched a lot before buying this slow cooker. I have a Nesco roaster that I love and use often. I needed a large slow cooker. I started researching. Started out with the all clad but everyone said it got really hot. I wanted a good one. The Cuisinart had good ratings elsewhere and I thought well even it cooks faster that is fine. I will just watch it until I get used to it and go from there. Every dish I have watched..they all cooked in LESS than half the allotted time. Today I made a crock pot mac and cheese casserole and it burned within ONE HOUR. Way too hot. I called Cuisinart several times and they said I may have a defective unit. Well I doubt it. I just think it runs hot. I really was dismayed because I love the size and the design of this cooker. Really was not up to par with Cuisinart products that I know and love. \n\nLet me also say that I am a good cook. I feel that I know my way around any appliance. I was not happy that I was not going to be able to leave this cooker all day but I was ok to give it a try. It is not at all what I expected. I read the other reviews here and wish I would have taken heed of them. I had read good reviews elsewhere and saw two articles in magazines on this cooker being the best. \n\nIf you are going to spend 100 bucks on a slow cooker, stop, get one of the higher end rival ones with a timer and then get a nesco roaster. You can cook anything all summer without heating up your kitchen.\n'

aS'\tUnsuitable for Brown Rice\n\tI spent several hours searching  and amp; researching rice cookers trying to find one that was designed specifically for brown rice. I finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice, and had brown rice  and quot;measurements and quot; which are different than for regular white rice. I am disappointed. First of all, the manual recommends NOT using the  and quot;keep warm and quot; function when using brown rice. This means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over. This defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker. But even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly. It does not. It is either too wet  and amp; mushy, or too dry and burnt. We have been unable to cook a proper batch yet, after much experimentation with slightly more or less water, and using 3 different types of brown rice. Look elsewhere, and let me know if you find one that works properly with brown rice\n'

aS"\tSo bad I threw it away\n\tI saw the 3-star reviews here, but decided to ignore them as this pan was on sale for a very good price.  That was a big mistake.\n\n1.  The first problem is with the size of the muffin cups -- they are significantly more shallow than in a typical mini-muffin pan.  \n\n2.  The silicone warped from the heat while in the oven, spilling the meager contents of the tiny cups over the edges, making flat, crooked, ugly muffins.\n\n3. The silicone did not release the muffins easily.  I did spray it with nonstick spray before filling, and allowed the muffins to cool completely before I tried to get them out.  \n\nI didn't even bother to try and wash it, so I don't have any comment about the ease of washing.  I won't be wasting any more time and ingredients in it, so I threw it away.  I wish I could get my money back.  This is not the quality you would expect from KitchenAid\n"

aS"\tNever Again For This Skillet\n\tIf I could give no stars for this, I would. I've been using electric skillets for more years then I care to say. I love cooking with them and when my last one simply wore out from so much use, I bought this one. What a mistake. After only minimal use, the middle of the pan began to burn extra hot and all the food was sticking and burning. Then the coating began to peel from the pan. The middle began to buldge slightly so the surface was not flat for even frying. What a nightmare!! This pan was less then two months old! And I do know how to treat and cook with electric skillets - just in case you were thinking I did something to cause this. I have never been so disappointed in a product before. However, it did have a new place in our home - the trash can. Guess I should have read the reviews first. Now that was my mistake!!\n"

aS'\tWhat is the world coming to...???\n\tWhy do manufacturers always have to change a good thing?  \n\nI had a Rival crockpot for over 12 years.  It always worked great.  The idea behind a crockpot is to cood slow and low.  My old Rival cooked at 150 degrees on the "Low" setting.  \n\nI use the old Rival all the time, and decided to get a second one so I could use them both simutaneouly and cook two recipes at the same time.  I looked at the reviews for the electronic Rival models.  Everyone said they cooked too hot.  So I finally purchased this 6.5 quart model with the simple knob control.\n\nWell, I filled the crockpot full of 8 lb.s of chicken.  The next morning, I could smell the burning food.  I looked in the pot, and the chicken was boiling on the "Low" setting.  \n\nSo, the next night I filled it full of a vegetable soup recipe.  The next morning, the soup was boiling over ... again on the "Low" setting.  The veggies were overcooked and mushy.  I measured the temperature and it was 195 degrees.\n\nI won\'t buy anymore Rival products.  I only gave this 2 stars because I guess you could conceivably use it to make soup ...

The crank does have a "good grip", but I\'m not trying to grip it, I\'m trying to turn it.   I do this by putting my right thumb under the near end and pushing up, with my index finger on the far end pushing down.  The knob\'s shape (relatively short, fat in the middle and tapering to rounded ends) makes this cumbersome and tiring.  It does open cans cleanly most of the time, but If i\'m opening a large can or several cans, I reach for my old basic Swingaway (which sells, incidentally, for less than half the price of this OXO)\n'

aS"\tTerrible waste of money\n\tThis is the worst blender I've ever used. Bought it to make smoothies, but it has a hard time grinding frozen things. It never completely chops up frozen fruit, so I always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi-mushy fruit when I try to blend with this thing. Not pleasant. It's also loud and it moves a lot. Sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base, and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base's well. I strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing\n"

aS'\tYou can\'t be serious!\n\tAfter checking every store I could think of and accepting that I\'d have to go online, I laughed out-loud when I saw this price! What was Mr. Coffee thinking? I read the other reviews of these filters and became aware that I don\'t even need them! Duh, I have filtered water in our house! Thank you Mr. "Train Man." The little carbon filter sounded like a good idea, but my coffee will survive without it. At least it\'s not a total loss because I like the coffee maker itself. Happy brewing.\n'

aS"\tDisappointed\n\tBought my first Vornado years ago, and is the best fan I've ever seen. Decided to get a second one... purchased this model. First unit had bad vibration, returned it. Second unit less vibration, but very noisy. Also returned. When I compare this unit to my original Vornado, the quality of construction is noticeably much inferior. I don't know if this applies to the rest of the Vornado lineup or not.\n"

aS"\tNew Fry-guy - pretty pleased....\n\tI've always wanted a deep fryer, and finally decided to take the plunge.  After doing quite a bit of research, I decided on this model - picked one up at Bed, Bath, and Beyond with a 20% coupon.  In my opinion, you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors wasn't a real concern. \n\nI must say, overall, I am quite pleased. While I am new to frying, I found it extraordinarily easy (it is pretty hot though, so be careful).  Only complaint would be that the capacity is a  little on the small side, say if you're cooking entrees for a larger family (for example, you can really only fit 3 (MAYBE 4) pieces of chicken at a time).  But since the chicken needs to cool down anyway, this wasn't such a major issue.  It came out nice, crispy, and golden brown - not too soggy, not too crisp - perfect.  \n\nI figure if it can handle the chicken, vegetables and smaller portions will be a piece of cake.  Although I've only fried a couple of batches, I am beyond pleased - but I'll let you know if I have any problems...  Great item so far though.\n"

aS"\tBest. Knife. Ever.\n\tI've been a German knife snob for years.  But this 8-inch chef's knife by Japan's Global is the finest blade I've ever owned.  Period.\n\nMaybe it's not as easy to sharpen as a Wustof or a Henckel, but then again, it holds its edge ten times longer.\n\nI've spent ten years and hundreds (and hundreds and hundreds!) of dollars collecting German steel.  Global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again\n"

I am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all\n'

aS'\tThese towels are so soft and fluffy!\n\tI love using them and when washed in fabric softener they are great.  It is a great deal.  Was kind of worried before purchase from reading some of the other reviews but after having had them a week, my whole family loves them.  They are much better than the more expensive famous designer towels that I have.  For people who are complaining about these towels, go price similar items at your local high end department stores\n'

aS'\tExcellent kid\'s game\n\tAs a mathematician, game theorist, and proud Chi Omicron Chi (XOX, aka "Xocks") brother, I have always been interested in this the simplest of m,n,k games, i.e. games in which players alternate placing markers on an m x n board with each player trying to place k of his or her markers in a row.  As every game theorist knows, perfect tic-tac-toe play by both players results in a tie game every time, with neither player achieving victory.  The clever child will figure this out on her own, as I did at an early age, and I lost interest in playing tic-tac-toe before I turned five.  I never lost interest, however, in studying tic-tac-toe and similar games, which began my pursuit of mathematics and game theory, and partly accounts for my joining Chi Omicron Chi as a college freshman.  As part of our initiation, pledges had to play a modified form of tic-tac-toe with vodka-filled shot glasses for markers.  Each player had five glasses, and as he placed his marker, he would empty his glass.  The loser would drink the remaining shot glasses.  Most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic-tac-toe, so really the point of the game, as with most fraternity games, was to see who could best hold his liquor.  I do remember one unfortunate pledge, Bob, who never figured out how to play perfect tic-tac-toe and nearly drank himself into catatonia.\n\nAll these thoughts came rushing, so to speak, back to me when I saw the "Shot Glasses Tic-Tac-Toe" available for so reasonable a price at about a dollar per component.  I have a four-year-old son who has yet to perfect his tic-tac-toe game, so I bought this set to educate him.  We play the same way I did in the Xocks fraternity house.  Of course I don\'t give him pure vodka in his shot glasses; he only weighs 35 lbs.  As 35 lbs represents approximately a fifth of my own weight, I dilute his vodka in a 1-to-4 dilution with orange juice.  I know what you\'re thinking: what happens when he loses and must finish off the remaining shot glasses, including mine?  I am nothing if not fair, so when he loses, I give him an equivalent amount of diluted vodka to however much pure vodka I have remaining in my shot glasses.  Since I, knowing how to play perfect tic-tac-toe, never lose to my son, the reverse problem, my having to drink his remaining shots, never occurs.\n\nMy son loses more often than not, and he usually ends up walking into walls, falling down, and later becoming violently sick.  You would think all this negative reinforcement would promote rapid and forceful mastery of tic-tac-toe, but his cognitive development must be lacking.  I can only surmise that the time delay between his losing tic-tac-toe games and the negative effects of alcohol poisoning inhibits his forming the negatively reinforcing connections.  He still loves to play, however, but his game, if anything, seems to be getting worse, almost as if he is trying to lose\n'

aS"\tWhat's with all the fuss?\n\tSo I read all your reviews previous to my purchase on this AND was skeptical. There were many reviewers that complained about cracks and problems holding an air-tight seal. MINE WORK PERFECTLY! They are invaluable and I'm glad I bought two of these canisters. Are you people sending the canisters through the dishwasher? If so, stop it! The intense heat will eventually crack anything made of plastic. Do you have an OLD model vacuum sealer? Maybe that's the problem - a performance issue. I have the newer stainless steel V2860 and you couldn't pry that out of my hands! I would give it 10 stars if there was such a rating.\n\nToday, I give this product 5 stars. Like most products - only time will tell how well they will hold out in the long run\n"

aS'\tWell built, but a little loud!\n\tThis electric water heater feels very solid and well built. When filled to 1.7 liters, it takes about 6 min 30 seconds to boil. The kettle automatically shuts off when it boils and makes a nice bell noise when finished. I thought this would be annoying, but it is not! Also, when switched on, there is a nice white LED lighting up the water supply making it easy to read.\n\nMy only complaint about this kettle is that it is rather loud (which is why I only gave it 4 stars) when it is on. A few moments after the switch is turned on, it makes this rumbling noise for the entire duration of operation\n'

aS"\thighly functional, a couple of drawbacks.\n\tFirst, the good stuff: this peeler is sharp, requires little effort in peeling away even the toughest skins and seems quite durable. I like having it, but I'm also holding on to my cheap little Oxo peeler for a couple of reasons: first, the Rosle produces very thick peels, which is a bit wasteful. Second, I tend to be a switch hitter in terms of peeling direction and really like having a peeler that can either peel toward me or away from me. The Rosle peels in only one direction and thus sells both a right-handed and left-handed peeler. That said, I do appreciate its sold stainless steel construction, which will resist rust for many more years than lesser models\n"

aS"\tVery Pleased\n\tWe have been using these for several years now.  For refrigerator storage and reheating, we use these containers almost daily.  I remember the lids were a bit stiff at first, but not impossible unless you are over 80.\n\nAfter 5 or 6 times through the dishwasher, they were prefect and remain so.  They nest nicely and they fit in the dishwasher and come out looking good.  The vent is not that exciting a feature, but if it wasn't there you'd have more microwave clanup. \n\nRegardless, I highly recommend these\n"

aS"\tSuper light weight, durable dinner plates\n\tThis plate, the 10 inch is the normal size dinner plate, just so you know. It's easy to buy the wrong size with these because they come in so many sizes. My aunt has had the Winter Frost White as long as I can remember, and now I am slowly building my own collection. I love them - they are very light and strong. I tried throwing a plate on the kitchen floor and it is still intact. The material feels like a combination of porcelin and pyrex as weird as that sounds. They are so thin and light that I could probably carry at least 35 of them. This is perfect for your everyday meals. Highly recommended\n"

aS"\tStrong Reliable Mixer--the Best!\n\tI was a KitchenAid fan.  I had the Special Edition 350 watt and burned the motor out twice in just a couple of years.  When it burned out the 2nd time I decided not to spend another $100+ on repairs.  I bought this Delonghi and love it.  \n\nThe splash guard is great and convenient to use (I'd never used the KitchenAid splash guard because it was too much trouble).  Now I don't know how I ever lived without one--no more white dust all over my counters.\n\nThe power is more than I'll ever need but at least I don't have to worry about burning the motor out.  \n\nIt is very easy to change attachments.  You can even change them while the splash guard is on.  \n\nIt is also very easy to clean.  \n\nGreat Buy\n"

aS"\tGreat, but buy elsewhere\n\tThe KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. \n\nAt this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer\n"

aS'\tPowerful, quiet, and well worth the price\n\tMy living room (approx 12\'x16\' and open to the kitchen) was always the last room to cool down after a hot day. It sometimes took most of the night to cool despite standing a powerful fan in front of it. The Bionaire BW2300 cools it in half the time it used to take.\n\n~Edit: My statement that this fan cools my liviing room in half hte time I once did is inaccurate. If the outside temp is lower than inside, the fan cools the living room in just a couple of hours.~\n\nIt also does a great job circulating air when its hot out (and in) to keep the room from feeling stuffy. \n\nI have not experienced the temperature gauge problem that other reviewers have. The temp gauge on mine works well.\n\n~Edit: The thermometer reads the temp of fan\'s exact location, not the room\'s temperature. For example, in the afternoon sun, mine consistently registers a much higher temp than the actual room tempature. When it is colder outside at night, it registers a slightly colder temp than the room temp. ~\n\nIs it really quiet? Yes! I have a Vornado fan, which is quite quiet for a fan. This is even quieter (although not silent).\n\nTo accomodate different window sizes, this model comes with a built-in extender, and two add-on extenders. The fan with extenders isn\'t large enough to fit my 38.5" window width. I could order another add-on extender from the manufacturer, but stuffed a wash cloth in the gap instead. \n\nWhat comes in the box? The fan, two extenders, two AAA batteries and the remote. \n\n~Edited 7/28/06:\nI bought a second one for my bedroom. Its thermometer is completely inaccurate and overstates the temperature until the outside temp is about 75 degrees.\n\nThe slats which the air blows through are fixed on this model. So I cannot direct the air onto (or away from) a particular area of the room.\n'

aS'\tThe best grater I ever owned\n\tThis is truely a professional grater.  Does a great job with hard cheeses and chocolate, etc..  Looks and feels great in the hand, and is impressive to have on the table for your dinner guests to grate their own Parmesan\n'
p235
aS"\tWorks wonderfully\n\tI carefully read most of the reviews for this product before purchasing so I would know what to expect.  They mostly said the same thing:  either it broke or it worked perfectly.  The consensus seemed to say use only hard cheeses, and don't overcrank the handle.  We have only used it for parmesan cheese, and so far we've had no problems.  It works great so far\n"

aS"\tnearly perfect\n\tThis tea pot, like their French-Press coffee pot, is made of `magic glass' - it doesn't seem to break.  I'm hard on things and usually need heavy-duty models just for every day survival.  I've had this tea pot for - maybe 8 years - unheard of for things around me. The glass just doesn't seem to break.  Others have spoken about how you use it to make tea - a brilliant idea.  But here's the other cool thing: when you get a `presentation' tea like say a `peony' tea that opens into a flower or say, a sea-shell tea like peets.com sells that opens up into an oyster looking shell with a string of jasmine flowers as `pearls' floating above it - you can SEE the magic unfold and enjoy the beauty and art of the tea unfolding if you leave the infuser out and just let the folded tea do what ever it does.\n\nThe ONLY down side is that the cap won't fit on the tea pot if you take the infuser out.  But I have never found that to be a problem.  The tea MAY cool a bit faster - but not so much so that it bothers me.  The fact that it is glass and has outlasted so many hand thrown ceramic tea pots I've had speaks to it's wonder and durability.  Like I said, this is made of magic glass.\n"
p240
aS"\tPerfect measurers!\n\tI have purchased many different brands of measuring spoons and cups in the past but these are by far the best!  Heavy (but not too heavy to use) so the handles don't bend (or float around in the dishwasher), shaped well so they fit into containers and spice bottles easily, easy to level and the measurement markings will not fade away (they are engraved).  I love my set...will definately buy another set (cooking is my hobby)\n"

aS"\tTHE kitchen essential\n\tThis pot is a perfect medium-sized saucepan. The double handles are a great feature. We use it at least once a day in our kitchen. The non-stick surface is extremely durable, although I'm not sure I would use metal utensils with it. I use a blue scrub sponge to clean it. I'm not sure I would use the more abrasive, green 3M pads. Overall a very durable, high-quality cooking utensil. In fact I'm back here today to buy one for a friend\n"

aS"\tImprovement over Pyrex\n\tI had traditionally used pyrex cake pans and wasn't completely satisfied with the results.

p243
aS"\tA great, but expensive, addition to the kitchen\n\tThe French-made Roul'pat, like its cousin the Silpat, is a flexible silicon mat enclosing a thin, fiberglass mesh for durability. The Roul'pat is designed for creating a non-skid work surface for rolling out and kneading dough. The tacky surface adheres to the counter without clinging to the dough, making it easier to roll out thin pastry crusts and the like. Because the mat is flexible, the transfer of a pie crust to pan is a cinch. Dipped chocolates don't stick, nor does fondant. At sixteen and a half inches by twenty-four, the surface is expansive enough for most recipes. The only drawback to this unusual mat is the inability to cut on it, ruling out anything that requires a cookie cutter or knife. The manufacturer also warns against folding and scraping the surface.\n\nI find the Roul'pat works best on pie crusts, pizza dough, chocolate, and flatbreads (or any bread dough that requires rolling or shaping.) Clean up is simple - wipe with a damp sponge and rinse. Mild soap can be used if needed, although I try to keep the surface detergent free. (The Roul'pat is not dishwasher safe.)\n\nThis makes a fantastic gift for cooks who seem to have everything\n"

This pan, according to the description, measures 17-4/5 by 7  and  4/5 by 2 inches. I'd imagine that the individual loaves would probably measure approximately 8 by 3  and  1/2 inches, a good size for, for instance, zucchini bread loaves intended as Christmas gifts\n"

aS'\tTHE cookware for serious home cooks\n\tMy fiance and I registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us.  I have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware.  This is exactly what the Dr. ordered!  Here\'s why:\n1)  Heavy, sturdy construction.  These things can take a beating.  They heat evenly and hold heat very well.\n2)  You can use metal utensils with them.  I hate plastic spatulas!  We all know that we aren\'t supposed to use metal with non-stick pans but we all do and then after a while our pan is a useless, peeling shadow of its former self.  Well this isn\'t the case with Calphalon 1!  Scrape away with any device you have at your disposal with no fear.  \n3)  They "stick" and sear as well as cast iron cookware (it\'s a good thing).  This is the best feature for me.  Coated non-stick cookware has its place but if you like to pan sear and get those tasty browned bits for sauces you used to have to use a pan that\'s not non-stick such as stainless steel or cast iron.  They "stick" for a reason.  You need that contact with the cooking surface to get that great browning.  Now there\'s the Calphalon 1 which sears as well as cast iron pans but cleans up like a non-stick pan.  It\'s a no-brainer!  \n4)  They look cool, have great handles, they\'re oven-safe, and they come with a lifetime warranty.  \n\nThese are not cheap.  If your primary goal in cookware is super easy cleanup then don\'t buy this expensive set.  It will dissapoint you.  But, if you want the advantages of traditional cookware combined with easier cleanup in a durable, functional set, and are willing to shell out the $$$ for a top-of-the-line product then this is for you.  Serious cooks who need the correct tools will love this cookware\n'

aS"\tgreat for gripping!\n\tIf you have problems with gripping those round coffee grinders, this one is for you! It's oval shape makes holding it much easier than a round grinder. It grinds well and quickly and is a breeze to clean with just a few flicks of a pastry brush (dedicate one specially for this as it will discolor over time). It's the shape that makes it great\n"

aS"\tCordless, programmable, and yummy.  What more could you ask for?\n\tI've had one of these for many years and it recently went on the fritz after a LOT of usage.  I'm getting another.  It can't be beat - and the fact that it's cordless is huge.  You can have a table full of folks for dinner, and walk around freely with your percolator; no unplugging required.  And the coffee comes out delicious\n"

aS'\tJust the right size for my family\n\tI bought one of these for my daughter for Christmas and I got this particular one because it had all the attributes she wanted.  She wanted it to be small ehough for just two people and to be able to remove the bowl for cleaning.  This was the ONLY one I found with those attributes.  There were 1 qt. size that were too little and all the bigger ones for big families.  After she got it she liked it so well that I bought one for myself and it works perfectly.  I think the size for a small family and the ease of cleaning are the real selling points for me\n'

aS'\tLove, love, love this iron!!!\n\tThis is my third Rowenta iron and they have all served me well, but this is by far the best.  The steam is amazing. You only have to made one pass on most items. I know it is a lot of money for an iron but it is worth every penny for the time it saves\n'

aS"\tgreat little toaster oven!\n\tHaving gone through our share of toaster ovens in 22 years of marriage, this is by far the best.  It's classy looking on the counter, easy to clean, very lightweight, quiet and has alot of options for toasting and baking that make the food come out just as it should.   I can't imagine going back to a traditional toaster oven again.\n"
p258
aS'\tEgg timer for the cooking impaired.\n\tAs a person who could set boiling water on fire, I can truely state that this hard boiled egg timer has helped me be able to boil an egg.  Prior to this I never knew if the egg was done and usually I either over cooked them, or worse, under cooked them.  Now they come out perfect everytime.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND\n'

aS'\tCorelle Dishwear\n\tI love our new white Corelle.  It is so light and takes up much less room in the cabinet.\n'
p260
aS"\tGreat Product\n\tPfaltzgraff products are always reliably good, the Pistoulet dinnerware actually makes me feel cheerful when I use it. The colors are great and the designs are whimsical. I bought two sets in different colors and mix and match which makes the eating experience even more fun. I want to start collecting all the fun serving pieces too. The only thing I didn't like was taking stickers off each piece in the box. That always makes me crazy, it should be against the law to put stickers on dishes\n"
p261
aS"\tDifferent and Useful\n\tThe angled slots are useful and easier than top loaders.  The right pull pushes the bread up once toasted, I love this feature.  The bagel toaster is handy as is the stop button.  All of the buttons and pulls are easy and intuitively obvious, you don't need a degree to operate it.  It looks interesting on my counter since it doesn't look like the typical toaster.  I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that a large slice of bread doesn't fit all the way in, the slots could have been a  bit larger.  They are wide enough for fat bread.  I really like this toaster so far.\n"
p262
aS"\tA very satisfactory purchase\n\tThe Senseo delivers a good, hot cup of coffee in either single or double mode. It's easy to fill, easy to use, easy to clean, and accepts any suitably shaped coffee pod. The only mild annoyance is the rattly cup tray during the brew-pump operation\n"

aS"\tI love this bowl!\n\tI have several pieces of All Clad.  I love this little bowl!  It's great for mixing brownie's, eggs, pancakes....etc.  I have other bowls, but, this is the one I reach for.  You're buying with confidence when you purchase All Clad.  The name speaks for itself, quality!  You will not be disappointed\n"
p265
aS"\tWonderful find...\n\tI just received this set the other day, and am absolutely thrilled. It is top-notch quality, and the pieces are very heavy. My silverware drawer looks so pretty and perfect, I am tickled every time I open it! It is definitely the last set I'll ever need. And at this price,(and free shipping to boot) there is no better deal anywhere\n"
p266
aS'\tNice for small batches of sauces\n\tWorked very well when whipping up a roux. The heavy disc bottom did a good job of evenly distributing heat and didn\'t scorch. The rounded sides meant that I had no problem getting a whisk into the sides of the pan. Cleaned up easily and looks really nice. Whoever designed this stuff got the shape and materials right; it is very aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe main downside is that at 1 quart, it is not as useful if you need to cook for more than 2-4 people.\n\nNote to the person who had the pan discolor: simply sprinkle a little bit of "Barkeeper\'s Friend" in the pan and rub with a damp sponge. I find this cleaner shines up all my stainless steel to like-new condition with no scrubbing or scratching. It also works to keep the copper banding looking shiny\n'
p267
aS"\tThis is my second set of Pyrex Custard Cups ...\n\t... and I don't even make Custard! *LOL*  I just love these for small servings of ice cream, fruit, side dishes, etc.  They are great with meals for anything that you don't want to mix with the other foods on your plate.  They are perfect for snacks and desserts.  They are great for things such as pickles, olives, chopped onions, relish, dips, etc. on a casual buffet or picnic table.  They also work well for pre-portioning ingredients when making a complicated recipe or allowing younger kids to cook with you.  The typical Pyrex glass which is thick and a bit heavy is perfect for my family because it holds up to less than gentle everyday use.  I still want my children to learn to be careful with china and glassware, but I see no reason to be too 'precious' about everday dishware\n"
p268
aS"\tLovely Little Bowls For Great Price\n\t*****\nI bought two sets of four bowls to complement my nice set of everyday dishes for times when you want just a little bit of something---like a little yogurt, or some granola, some fresh raspberries---and we use them all the time.  I agree with a previous reviewer that they would be wonderful for food prep.\n\nThey are not thin, as a previous reviewer has noted.  They are not thick or bulky either, though, just perfect.  They seem like they will last a long time and wear quite well.  They almost look, well...elegant, which seems kind of cool for just Pyrex and for the price.  \n\nThe bowls come well-packaged, and although the price is very low, they definitely don't seem cheaply made.  I haven't seen them in stores, either.  Great buy!\n****\n"

aS'\tVery nice, durable and attractive\n\tI like this place setting color, but I have taken the advice of others and I use coffee filters between pieces for storage.  It is a great place setting\n'
p270
aS"\tWorks well; just what I was looking for\n\tI bought this timer, because my husband wanted one similar to the one his mom had, with the big display and the simple, three-button operation. This particular timer was better priced than most I looked at, and I liked the extra large display. I have been very happy with it. The buttons don't stick like other timers I have used. I like the way the memory feature works, and the bonus feature that it can count up is also nice\n"
p271
aS"\tGreat press and fantastic accessories!\n\tI've had another press for many years, but I couldn't get to it and had cravings for some Spritz cookies. So... I went out and bought this cookie press and to my amazement was very impressed with all the additional accessories it came with. The press worked beautifully (I've only used the small barrel so far.) I was concerned that it was battery operated, my last one was a plug in model. But it is nice not to be limited to working near a plug. We had no problems with the unit, it worked quite nicely. I'm looking forward to trying out some of the accessory attachments in the future. I would definitely recommend this press to anyone looking to buy a cookie press\n"
p272
aS'\tAlmost perfect\n\tI have used other egg cookers before, I like this one, but I am having to guess on the amount of water to get thew right soft boiled eggs.  Mine keep coming out almost hard boiled even though I use the soft boiled marks.\n'
p273
aS'\tUseful knife\n\tWe have had this knife for about 5 months now, and we use it daily; anything from peeling and dicing fruit, to slivering a potato.\nIt has a nice solid feel to it, and it has a remarkably sharp blade, which has held an edge very well.  The curved blade makes it a bit of a challenge to hone\n'
p274
aS'\tTalk about non-stick!!!\n\tI add lots of cheese to my pizzas and it tends to get all over the pan.  With other pans, the cheese sticks and I have to pry the pizza off with a spatula. BUT NOT THIS ONE!!  It just slides right off with one shake.  My party pizzas come out crisp and heated evenly.  Also, I have cut my pizzas on this pan and there was barely a scratch on it.  Very heavyweight with no warping.  What a buy!\n'
p275
aS'\tGreat suction, but could be lighter\n\tIts amazing how much dirt this little baby sucked off our couch and upholstry.  The ability to make the suction head vertical is quite helpful.  The vaccum cleaner is a bit on the heavy side though - if it had been a little lighter, I would have given it 5 stars\n'
p276
aS"\tI am crazy about this vacuum!!\n\tAfter my pregnancy, I was diagnosed with severe cat and dust allergies. I had two cats at the time. And dust? Well, alot of that. I cannot believe how well this vacuum works. I no longer have hives and haven't had any allergic reactions since purchasing this. Worth every penny\n"
p277
aS'\tExcellent pan and lifetime guarantee--excellent buy!\n\tI have a set of 16-year-old Farberware.  I ordered this 3 qt. pan as a replacement--the handle on my old 3 qt. cracked from where the screw hole is.  After I received this beautiful pan, I noticed the limited lifetime guarantee, called the number, and a new handle for my old pan is in the mail to me as we speak.  This 3 qt. pan is even nicer than the pans I bought almost 20 years ago and is higher than the old model with a nicer lid/rolled edges and nicer bottom--and it really is beautiful--very classic styling.  Since I use them so often and new one\'s so lovely, I will definitely keep the new one even though a replacement handle is on its way.\n\nI also have a 1 qt., 2 qt., 4 qt. pot, 4 qt. dutch oven, 10" skillet and little mini-skillet, all of which I use all the time (I use at least one or more daily) with no problems.  Very nice, basic cookware at a reasonable, affordable price.  I bought my cookware individually back when I couldn\'t afford to buy an entire set.  I loved the fact that you could buy a quality pan individually.\n\nBTW, I acquired one of my 4 qt. pots from my grandmother\'s possessions after who knows how many decades of cooking and it\'s still in excellent condition.  Also have her double boiler pot.  Even though the screws do loosen, I only have to tighten every few months at most and have never had a screw strip or lost a handle.  I would always buy another Farberware if needed (after seeing this new saucepan, would really like to buy a whole set of it, even though I don\'t really need it!\n'

aS'\tEveryone Should Have One!!!\n\tThis is the second Microplane grater that I have purchased (actually I purchased the extra coarse version), but the only 1 of the 2 that I would give a 5* rating to. The other grater was from the standard line not the professional line. With many kitchen items there are no significant differences between the two, but in this case it definitely matters!\n\nAll Microplane graters use the same basic technology for cutting -- technology which was originally developed for the woodworking industry but that has adapted for exceptional service in the kitchen as well. The razor sharp laser cut grating head will make quick  and  easy work of cheese grating or citrus zesting (if you have the proper size). I would suggest when choosing a size of grater that you choose 1 size larger as the sizing tends to run on the small size.\n\nNow, what makes the professional so much better? Well, the standard line has 3 major/minor flaws: 1) the easy-grip rubber handle tends to capture water when washed, 2) the plastic molded frame holding the grating surface cracks when washed in the dishwasher,  and  3) the head is so incredibly sharp that it must be kept covered, yet there is no easy way to due this except for the original tagboard cover.\n\nThe professional version fixes all of these issues. As you can see, the frame and handle are all stainless steel which eliminates issues #1  and  #2 and the professional version comes with a nice snap-on plastic cover to protect the sharp head surface.  In addition, the rubberized rest on the top of this version can come in very handy.\n\nEnd result: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n'

aS"\tYou're not buying a designer piece here...\n\tYes, it's rather uncomely - it's outer casing is obviously plastic and, ours at least, doesn't have that same sheen as the example.  It does look cheap.  THAT being said, it's a VERY functional toaster.  We've had NO problems in six+ months with variability - we know what we're going to get when we drop the lever.  The plastic exterior DOES STAY COOL.  So cool, in fact, that I promise you, you will forget normal toaster safety and burn yourself on the small exposed metal at the top.  Yep, this is a GREAT toatser for someone who wants a functioning toaster and doesn't mind that it's an ugly duckling.  An EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE MONEY\n"

aS"\tThis beast really cooks ....\n\tThis monstrous beast is the largest piece of cookware that we own.  Once I manage to wrangle it out from the cupboard and heft it onto the stove, it's many uses range from cooking chickens, small turkeys, and roasts to making potato leek soup.  The beautiful thing is that it really retains heat and cooks items thoroughly and evenly.  The downside is that it can take a while to heat up, especially since it should heat up on a med-low setting so as not to burn items and/or damage the porcelain.  Learned this the hard way by turning up my soup to med-hi in order to get it boiling more quickly (doh!).  Now that we know how to properly use this type of cookware, we are enjoying it much more!  Another clever use of this piece is to incorporate it into your weight lifting routine (did I mention this thing is very VERY heavy?).  Now that we have tried the largest, we have begun collecting some of the smaller pots and really enjoying them\n"

aS"\tThe best money I've ever spent!\n\tMy husband has allergies to cat dander, and we have 4 indoor cats. We finally broke down and paid $500+ for this vacuum and replaced our old bag vacuum. I must say, this thing is AMAZING! I cannot say enough good things about this vacuum. The first time we used it in our living room, we emptied the canister 3 times! And I had just vacuumed with my old vacuum the day before.. It is amazing what this machine picks up that other vacuums leave behind. I could find no flaws with this product, other than it would be nice if it were cheaper. :\n"

aS'\tGood value for a good fan\n\tReliable and functions.  Much less expensive than "ionic breeze" or other yuppie products one might get at the S.I. Has three fan settings and is very quiet.

aS'\tFavorite Accessory\n\tThis food chopper is my favorite extra appliance in the kitchen.  For salsas, the low speed lets me keep the ingredients chunky. For sauces, the higher speed can easily puree most ingredients. My favorite item to use it for is onions and it saves alot of tears.  The large bowl not only holds alot, but is also very  easy to clean. I highly recommend this food chopper for frequent or casual dicing cook\n'
p291
aS"\tA very nice sheet\n\tI was thinking of buying parchment paper before this product caught my eyes.   I took a chance after reviewing others' good reviews on it.  And it was a good buy.  I used it to bake and it's totally non-stick.  It's also very easy to clean after use.  If it can be used 5000 times as it claims, I definitely will save a lot compared to buying parchment paper\n"
p292
aS"\tThey DO bend after a while\n\tI've used these for months to protect tile countertops and they basically work except they start bending after a while on the edges and something light (like an empty glass)tends to fall over.  They are heavy duty and I put hot items on them with no problems\n"

Excellent item. I bought two stones and used them simultaneously for the first two homemade pizzas of my life... DELICIOUS! As others have suggested, I never remove the stone from the oven, and lately I just placed a pan containing the dough for an olive focaccia and it came out perfectly done. I am convinced that the stone works its magic also when not used to bake directly on it. I am extremely happy so far and I'd highly recommend this item. Buon Appetito\n"

aS'\tGreat Quality, Great Size!\n\tMy wife and I have long been fans of Fiestaware and we have been using many of their pieces for years. Somehow it wasn\'t until about 2 years ago that we discovered this size. At 9" the lunch plate is perfect for many occasions - especially lunch! (smile) \n\nThe quality of these plates is very good and this size is very uselul. For some reason these are seldom seen as part of a standard set. We use ours all the time... \n\nHighly Recommended!\n'

aS'\tEXCELLENT!\n\tI have used this filter with my Grind-n-Brew for 2 years. I put it in the dishwasher at least twice and have never had any problems with it. I have no idea what these other reviewers are doing wrong, but I love this filter. I never have grounds in my coffee. There is always a little darker/thicker coffee in the bottom of a good cup of coffee!\n\nAs for price, $20 is NOT the actual price for this filter. $10 is the "real" price, so you are not getting a deal on Amazon especially when you add shipping (unless you are getting free shipping). I have seen the same $10 filter at Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Ace Hardware, and Publix.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy a good cup of coffee and do not want to put the chemicals added to paper filters in your body, buy this coffee filter\n'
p302
aS"\tNot recommended for the long term\n\tI agree with most of the positive reviews of the VacuVin Food Saver set. However, I'd love a larger size--one that could hold at least one pound of ground coffee. I suppose the downside would be that it would take longer to pump the air out of a larger container. But, they're easy to use, look nice, and keep the food fresher longer. \n\nReview update: 05/03/2005 One Star\n2 of the containers won't hold a seal any longer. Not recommended for the long term.\n"
p303
aS'\tGood knife for the money\n\tThis was my first \'nice\' knife when I was taken in by the Santoku craze, and it was certainly a decent choice.  The knife is sharp out of the box, reasonably well balanced, and has pretty good fit/finish.  For the type of person who only buys things like veggies and boneless/skinless chicken, etc., that are largely prepared, this knife will probably fit the bill and allow you finish up small amounts of prep work.  The real drawback is the length.  When you live in the South, you see vidalia onions that are 7" in diameter.  This knife is a bit small to tackle the large veggies.  And don\'t even think about getting it near hard melons or bone-in meats.  Since I got this knife, I\'ve expanded my collection quite a bit, even adding some real Japanese steel.  But this little blade keeps a spot on my magnetic strip, where it comes out for small tasks or when my wife can\'t get me to relinquish the big blade.  For most cooks, who need a real omni-tasker knife, I would look for a 9-10" chef\'s knife rather than this.\n'

aS"\tOutstanding quality and great price.\n\tThis cooking/serving stainless steel slotted spoon, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you'll prefer this product to the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries.\nIts elegant, stylized shape makes it perfect to use either in the kitchen or at the dinner table, and it also comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging, and a strong, stout neck guaranteed to be unbendable.\nOverall, this spoon is perfect to strain vegetables, fruits, shrimp and other foods, and its easy to clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hardwearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years. Furthermore, its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away. \nAfter submitting this product to over three years of normal, everyday use, mine is still just like new.\n--Reviewed by Maritza Volma\n"

aS'\tBeauty and Function\n\tThis roasting pan is a prize and well worth the investment. It is heavy duty and I have used it for large rib roasts and a turkey.  It is wonderful for making gravy on my gas stove after roasting; the rack is so sturdy it holds any roast I could fit in my oven.  It washes clean with little effort so I have not had to use the dishwasher.  It looks like new after washing.  This pan will be around a lot longer than I will!\n'

aS'\tAs advertised\n\tAs advertised, and described in various reviews, the blender is solid, powerful and loud....very loud. I have to block my ears when it\'s running but I had expected that so I\'m not complaining.   My one complaint is that the "water tight" lid is not and if I fill it up too full liquid comes out the top.\n\nI use it for fruit smoothies (no ice) and vegetable soups and they come out very smooth\n'

aS'\tEasy and Cool In The Kitchen\n\tWe had been enjoying the whole experience of the Keurig B50, when I got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that Keurig was promoting a new and improved single-cup brewer. I confess - I coveted this new machine in a big way. So when we were the recipients of a bright shiny new B70 last week on our front stoop, it was very much like Christmas for me. My wife just smiled, and the kids gave out a sincere, "Whoa, that\'s cool!" at our new kitchen friend.\n\nEverything that we liked about the B50 is there for the B70 - with the addition of larger cup sizes and the overall look and feel. The coffee just tastes good, first and foremost. I\'ve tasted cups from other single-serve brewers, and most of them have been barely more appetizing than generic vending machine drop-the-cup coffee. From my first experience with the Keurig machines, however, I was amazed how good the brew tasted. The home brewers make a great cup of coffee without having to waste a pot, or lose the coffee all over the counter when the previous machine\'s brew basket got finicky. The additional My K-cup attachments allow for grinding our own beans, too - so as a coffee snob, I\'m hooked.\n\nThe Platinum B70 adds selection for cup size - right now, I think our best default size is 9.25oz, filling out most travel mugs and our normal in-house mugs well without getting watery on the k-cups we\'ve tried so far. And it has a larger reservoir for water, meaning we can get more coffee for fewer refills in the kitchen sink. All of these things would be enough, right?\n\nBut wow, it is just so cool looking. The blue LED lights that make the water glow on the left, and the blue LCD screen on the right that shows the clock, menu, cup selection, and the chrome fixtures - even the spring-loaded holder in the front top of the brewer - all of that combines to make it more than just a good coffee, taking us into the realm of a really cool experience. The kids oooo and aaahhh every time they walk into the evening kitchen, seeing Daddy\'s glowing blue coffee brewer, just wanting to marvel in its glow.... okay, that\'s a little too melodramatic, but only slightly.\n\nIf you like coffee and spend more than $10 per day, or throw away more than a third of a pot of coffee each morning, or if you enjoy coffee but avoid making it at night because for just one cup that whole pot will go to waste - I think you owe it to yourself to try this brewer out. Not just in the store, but blue and glowing in your own kitchen. Trust me - "Merry Christmas" is a great feeling\n'
p312
aS'\tNOT a jackhammer, a GREAT tool.\n\tI just needed to refute that first review also. This is not a toy, it\'s not for mixing your ovaltine or slimfast shakes (though it will work for SURE). I assume that\'s what the first reviewer wanted it for. You can get a 19 dollar piece to do that. It\'s not "about a foot long!" It\'s 17 inches, and needs to be. It\'s also not 20 lbs. It\'s 2 lbs. and it\'s weight is perfect. It\'s not a "hand blender" for mixing water. It\'s an IMMERSION blender for making the thickest of the thick and the creamiest of the creamiest as far as soups go and 50 other uses. I\'m a professional chef, this is part of my kit that I don\'t leave home without. You shouldn\'t be home without it\n'
p313
aS'\tTerrific\n\tI feel obligated to defend this terrific appliance against the "misguided" reviewer who likened it to a jack-hammer.  That review gave me pause when I was considering ordering it.  Fortunately I had faith in Amazon\'s return policy and decided to give it a chance.  It\'s not at all too heavy or too large.  I\'m 5\' 3" with small hands and it fits in my hand perfectly.  It really is ergonomically designed.  The power button falls directly under your fingers when you hold it.  You have no need to change your grip until you\'re through blending--which is next to no time.  It blends thoroughly and efficiently.  It does have enough weight to give you some control.  You wouldn\'t want something this powerful to be too light--it could just fly out of your grasp.  This feels solid, is very attractive, and also appears to be very well made.  I love it. If you think you might want an immersion blender (and if you cook, you do) you\'ll love it too.\n  \nIt should be noted that this is also called an immersion blender. I was confused by the two designations--hand blender/immersion blender.  Apparently they are the same thing although listed separately\n'

aS"\tNice Pans\n\tI've used these for a while and they still hold up pretty well. They say not to put them in the dishwasher but I have and the non-stick is holding up fine. The lids fit nice and tight and the handles don't get too hot - unless you are just taking one of them out of the oven, in that case the handle will be HOT.\nAll said I definately recommend these cause:\n1.  There is just the right pans for most situations - who really needs 15 pans?\n2.  You get good quality for the money.\n3.  The non-stick is terrific\n"
p319
aS'\tLovely to use - handy - well made.\n\tThough these utensils are not recommended for direct use with the Cuisinart pots and pans (they will scrape the finish) they have a terrific feel to them.  They are evenly balanced with a useful machanical advantage.  I find them especially functional as serving utensils at the table.  \nThis tool set is very well made, each tool has an excellent finish and "look" to it, the long handles and super excellent size for dishing out your cooking creations makes them a positive addition to any kitchen. \nI really use my set and highly recommend this kitchen tool set!\n'

aS"\tBetter than more expensive designer brands\n\tI bought these in a few colors (at a higher price) about a month ago. They were purchased to replace some designer catalog towels that I mistakenly thought would be of better quality. Well the designer towels shed about 1/2 their heft in my drier.\n\nSo here I came to Amazon looking for a better alternative.\n\nI ordered 3 sets of these and am impressed with their drying ability and their feel. The towels are nice and thick and absorbent (like a towel should be, right?). The package of six include two sets -- making this an even better deal.\n\nI just went back and bought another three sets for use over the holidays with out of town guests. You won't be  sorry with these. I am tossing my old towels and using these sets almost exclusively\n"

aS"\tDon't be put off by the expense!\n\tThis is a brilliant device and the Daddy of pizza wheels, all pizza parlours should buy one or two they would save themselves a fortune! One spin across the pizza and it's done! no repeated to and froing or worse, finishing the job with a knife! It does not need sharpening either, just as well cos I am clueless as to how on earth you would do that job! Oxo brands are just really really good so start collecting now\n"
p322
aS'\tVery good scale but different model from advertised version\n\tThe scale I received from Amazon looks the same as the picture for the "Soehnle Vera White Digital Food Scale" but it\'s a different model. The one I received uses the CR-2430 lithium battery, not four AAs as advertised. Also, the product manual is different. The actual manual\'s title is "67000 - 67007 g/oz," not "8122/8123 g/oz." On the bottom of the scale, there is a number similar to Soehnle\'s product numbers, 812215. But I could not find such a product anywhere.\n\nFortunately, the maximum weight capacity of this scale is 5000g as advertised. It\'s actually about 5280g. The unit of measure is in 1g or 0.05oz increments. Weighing items with this scale is very easy. The LCD screen has large 0.5" numbers. It has a 2-minute auto shut-off switch, and a supposedly low-battery indication.\n\nOverall, this is a very good scale and I recommend it if you\'re willing to put up with purchasing a lithium battery once in a while\n'

aS"\tCuisinart is short-sighted\n\tI love my cuisinart prep 11 plus food processor.  Since I use it for all sorts of cooking, I have purchased all of the disks for it.  I don't want three or four different holders for disks, etc. because I don't have unlimited closet and counter space.  Since they sell a complete set of disks why, oh, why don't they sell a tower (small footprint) that will hold all of the attachments.  This is short sighted of them.  I have friends who have the same gripe.  If someone manufactures such a disk holder we would be interested in knowing how to contact that company\n"
p324
aS"\tExcellent knife set, highly recommend!\n\tIf you prep a lot of fruits and vegetables in your kitchen, this is the set for you.\n\nThe Santoku knife is lighter than a standard chef's knife.  But this is what makes it so wonderful on fruits and vegetables.  I have used it to carve prime rib (just to see how if worked) and it performed just as well as my chef's knife, except that it is a little smaller.\n\nI find that I use the Santoku 90% of the time in my kitchen.  If you are diminutive female, this knife feels right in the hand since it is a little smaller than a standard chef's knife.  I love the blade on this knife.  It holds an edge much longer than my non-Wustof knives.\n\nThe paring knife is nothing special.  But it does have the same nice hard blade that is on the Santoku.\n\nYou will not be disappointed in this purchase if you love to cook.\n"
p325
aS"\tMy Son says its the best knife ever!\n\tI sent this knife to my son who is a baker by profession--he loves this knife.  It doesn't mash the bread and cuts through crusty crusts! I higly recommend it to anyone\n"

aS'\tNice Waffle makes\n\tThis one works great.  I had a square krupps waffle maker before and this one is ten times better....cooks better, heats faster, looks better, and the audible ready alert is great.  I saw this one on Good Eats on Food Network, and I am thrilled that I have this one....exactly what I wanted\n'
p327
aS"\tAbsolutely Beautiful Cookware\n\tI bought the 14 piece set for my parents and then added this pan to their collection. They just love it. \n\nIt is so nice that my mom doesn't even bother to put food in a serving dish, she just sits this pan on the table when we have company. It is so regal and incredibly well made. It always looks beautiful.\n\nThe other thing I like is that the handles and bottom of the pan are stamped Cuisinart so everyone knows this is a quality item. \n\nI'm very happy with my purchase\n"

aS"\tFantastic idea!\n\tThis thing is wonderful. I've enjoyed one since my first home and it makes a tremendous difference- esp. if you rent and don't have any control over the kind of tub you have.\n"

aS'\tPerfect Choice\n\tMy teapot arrived from Amazon very quickly and I was very pleased with my first purchase. It is just the right size for me as I usually make two or three cups. Even though it could hold more, it is not too large for a smaller amount. The tea does not drip when poured . . . thank goodness! The one I had before consistently dripped so my reason for getting a new one. This one also fits well in my hand, and I love the fact that you can microwave it if you need to heat up a bit. Overall, I would say it is quite lovely and and high quality\n'
p330
aS"\tThis Spoon is AWESOME\n\tEven if entering the kitchen gives you hives, this spoon can make it easier. It's balanced, easy to use and easy to clean and store.  It goes from the cooktop to serving in a contemporary fashion...WITHOUT spilling, breaking like some of the el-cheapo brands.  If you care for this spoon - it will serve you well for many years.  My first one - I used to death and it died only as a result of an accident with (in?) the blender.  Been searching for one ever since to replace - and at this price I am buying several\n"

aS'\tLove them!!!\n\tI have had these pans for five years now and I use them almost every night.  I have never had any problems with them and they cook the food very evenly.  I would highly recommend them.\n'
p332
aS"\tGreat Every Day\n\tThis thing is a workhorse... I use it every day. Mine's been going strong for over five years now. I just wish they'd bring back the translucent colors. I love being able to see at a glance whether the kettle has water in it or not. With the current opaque black or white models that's not possible.\n"
p333
aS"\tGreat, but buy elsewhere\n\tThe KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus (KV25G0X) is a great product, but you should buy it elsewhere. We ordered it from Amazon, and got the Commercial (KM25G0X) instead. We did not want that, so contacted customer service. They said they'd exchange it, but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good, obviously. Then, the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse, so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise. They said they sometimes substituted similar products. Great. \n\nAt this point we gave up, and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer\n"

aS"\tThe Best Ever!\n\tI have owned this can opener now for several months and it is BY FAR the BEST can opener I have ever owned.  I have had probably 10 electric openers in my lifetime, but this is just wonderful.  It is smooth, super easy to attach the can, quiet, and does NOT splatter the contents of the can all over the opener when it's done cutting like all the other did!!!  The detachable parts make it sanitary too, you can put it in the dishwasher! I can't say enough about this opener....you will NOT be disappointed!!\n"
p335
aS'\tgreat set of knives\n\tI\'ve never had a "nice" set of knives before. These are great! They have a nice feel in my hands. The only reason I didn\'t give them a 5 star rating is because the kitchen scissors do not come apart. The scissors I bought at Smart  and  Final come apart for easy washing and drying\n'
p336
aS"\tA review NOT from a seller\n\tThe other review is so obviously someone from SENTRY that I thought I'd add my two cents. My house hasn't burned down so I don't know if this works, but I've read other articles that say it does. It is heavy (since the foam contains water to evaporate and dissipate heat in a fire), and there is no rubber grips on the bottom, so it can slide around a lot. It's a lot cheaper and more convient than renting a safety deposit box.\n"
p337
aS'\tGood value fire protection\n\tSentry Insulated Chest\n\nEvery household should have some method of protecting things like birth certificates, deeds, wills, stocks, bonds, and other valuables.\n\nPros:\n\n  - Inexpensive box helps keeps your valuables "safe" from fire, kids, and nosey adults.\n  - Attractive; has nice handle; no sharp edges.\n  - Excellent value for the money.\n\nCons:\n\n  - Flat key model (SEN1100) has a rather cheap-looking lock mechanism.\n  - It weighs nearly 20 pounds, but that\'s because the walls are 1" thick and fire-resistant material isn\'t light.\n\nGo to sentrysafe dot com to view all the Sentry offerings.  \n\nMy advice is to buy the Sentry model 2100 rather than this model (SEN1100).  The 2100 has a better (tubular key) lock, but only costs a few dollars more.  (Staples dot com sells the 2100.)  Sentry rates these boxes as follows:\n\n1100 - UL classified - 30 minute fire protection\n2100 - ETL verified for 30 minute fire protection of CDs and DVDs up to 1550 degrees F\n\nNo small fire-box is particularly theft resistant.  Even if bolted down, a lid could be forced opened with tools.  In addition, although the 2100\'s fire rating is higher than the 1100, many non-portable safes offer better fire ratings.  They are also larger and far more expensive.  For better protection, you\'d need to spend more money, but a Sentry chest is much better than doing nothing.\n\nI use mine to store DVD backups of computer files.  The Sentry chest is kept inside a large, fire-resistant safe.  Hopefully, this double protection will do the job if there is ever a fire.  DVD and other computer media will be destroyed at much lower temperatures than paper.\n\n\nI\'m a retired Federal employee and have no connection whatever to any manufacturer of any product\n'

aS"\tUsed for freezing baby food\n\tI know these got poor reviews, as ice cube trays.  But I used them to freeze my baby's homemade fruits and veggies and they worked great.  The lids were a little tricky at first, but as long as you don't overfill them, you'll have no problems removing the lids.  A couple twists of the tray, and the food cubes slid right out!  They were much cheaper than trays marketed specifically for freezing baby food\n"
p340
aS"\tBecause a one that isn't cold is scarcely a one at all.\n\tNo picture can really do these glasses justice.  They have nothing aesthetic in common with any other double-walled cup I've ever seen--elegant, minimalist, super clear and light as a feather.  They really keep stuff cold (or hot, as the case may be).  They're even dishwasher safe.  However, they are remarkably fragile.  I accidentally rapped a spoon on the lip of one and within half an hour, the little crack had spread and the glass was in fragments.  But if you're careful with them and keep them away from kids, animals, and, apparently, me, they will serve you well\n"

aS"\tLarge and plush\n\tI ordered these towels in two colors mainly because the price was right.  But when they arrived I was so pleased.  They're larger than I expected and very plush.  I've washed them several times and they look as good as when I first opened them.  It's really nice to finally have towels that actually dry you off\n"
p342
aS"\tGreat substitute for Henckels\n\tIf you like knives that hold their edge, have good balance, and feel more expensive than they really are, this knife's a smart purchase.  We bought ours with the intent to get Henckels. My husband loves to cook and I have demanding standards for tools in my kitchen, especially knives.  Anolon were half the price and every bit as good.  \nAs their reputation spreads, the prices seem to be going consistently up.\n"

The Zyliss Scoop goes through cold ice cream very well and literally drops off the scoop into the bowl. Well worth the money. How nice to have a tool that works well. Like others, I've tried many scoops that did NOT work - frustrating!! Do yourself a favor: stop bending your soup spoons and get a Zyliss Ice Cream Scoop.\n"
p346
aS'\tMicrowave Egg Boiler\n\tIt works great, and it\'s small (6" high, 5" diameter) and easy to use. May require some experimentation to get times correct for your own microwave. For me: 7 minutes for soft, 8 min for medium, and 9-10 min for hard eggs on high power (700W microwave).\n\nIt does get very hot, so you need to remove it from the microwave with a potholder or towel. I place the whole thing under the cold tap, then remove the top, and cool the eggs under running water for a minute before peeling\n'
p347
aS"\tThe secret to success!!!\n\tThis is a wonderful can opener!!! I wouldn't have any other. The trick to having perfectly cut edges is to let the can spin around twice. I hold onto the can so that when it starts making its second round, I tighten my grip a little and the moment the lid comes lose it starts spinning. I have noticed that if I buy the dirt cheap, no name vegetables at the dollar store, the opener has difficulty. I guess one should blame the can and not the opener. It is a small price to pay for having such a safe appliance around. But then my opener is a couple years old so maybe my blade is just wearing out... If there is no replacement blade, you can bet I will buy another can opener just like this, and if I have to, on Ebay! \nI am sure this new technology has saved more than one lost or stray animal digging at the landfill or in the alley for a morsel of food. I just couldn't bear the thought of someone's lost puppy or an abandoned cat getting his tongue cut. Those old can openers are just plain dangerous. Call me a bleeding heart but it matters. It's not like my own pet couldn't knock the trash over when I'm gone and end up cutting themselves on one of those old fashioned, razor sharp lids. There are both elderly and child relatives in my house all the time and I just don't feel safe with those old tin cutters around. \nAll it takes is a little patience with new technology and using this can opener on more than just a couple cans to get the hang of it. There is no need to slam this appliance on the counter or floor. That's rediculous. As far as oversized cans, that's not what this was made for.\n"

aS"\tA great buy!\n\tThe AeroBed Premier Raised Queen sized bed is a Godsend.  Due to a disability, I needed a raised bed that would allow me the convenience of a somewhat normal height bed, so my husband  and  I could camp with other family members at a recent family reunion.  The AeroBed Premier Raised not only afforded me that ability, but also provided a surprisingly comfortable night's sleep as well.  The bed is made of the highest quality material, and did not lose any air.\n\n\nI needed a dependable product, as I would not have tried this with a cheap airbed.  I got all that I wanted in purchasing the AeroBed Premier Raised Queen sized bed, plus I now have a comfortable extra bed for overnight guests.\n"

aS"\tKeeps hot water hot!\n\tSo far this has been a great product. I've had it for about a year and a half and have used it almost every day to hold boiling water for making tea.  So far it has held up great.  This carafe keeps the water near boiling for at least 5 hours. When I leave the water in it for 24 hours, the water is still warm enough for me to make tea with it.\n\n  I have never used this item to store anything else other than water; but in theory, you should be able to make tea or coffe the night before and still have it hot in the morning 6 to 8 hours later, assuming the liquid is boiling when you pour it in.\n\n  Some of the heat from the water is lost from the initial contact with the carafe, so the liquid you store will always be a little cooler than its intial temperature.\n"
p356
aS'\tA well designed set\n\tI am very impressed with this set. The pans are of heavy guage steel and have rolled edges.  I had 3 pounds of chicken on the cookie sheet and with a one handed lift the pan did not flex as my other pans did, again heavy guage steel.  The handles and the nonstick surface have had no problems at 450 degrees. Other brands that I have used deteriorate rapidly at 400 degrees or above. Keep in mind I am not a cook and by my very method of cooking (set oven to high and wait til you smell something burning) I am very hard on pans of any kind. A very high quality product that I would have gladly paid 50 bucks for. By the way, the cooling rack is nonstick as well.\n'
p357
aS'\tVery Nice for Side Dishes\n\tThese oval dishes are just the right size for sides, and they stay warm a very long time besides looking great. I have served mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, all kinds of squash and even bay and sea scallops; everything looks better in these. Also bought several for my children. A fine addition to your Le Creuset collection\n'
p358
aS'\tGreat Oven Mitts\n\tI love these oven mitts.  They have a magnet in them so you can stack them one on top of the other and stick them to your oven or refrigerator, or other metal surface.

aS'\tAmazingly well designed and easy to keep clean\n\tHave to say "ditto" to all the reviewers below--I owned another brand before but it wasn\'t nearly as powerful.

aS'\tOutlast WORKS!\n\tI don\'t know how anyone could think that the outlast material isn\'t working.  (..of course it has been significantly tested and proven that it works.)  At first its cool.  After about 5 minutes (depending on the person) outlast starts keeping an even temp.. \n \nNow that even temp. may not be as cool as you want - but it never gets much warmer than you are UNLIKE most every other pillow (..even buckwheat pillows which become hotter because of the fabric encasing the buckwheat).\n\nThe negatives are however:\n\n1. The outlast material needs to be pretty close to your body to work - and it DOES have a distinctive texture that is a broad weave box pattern and is "stiff" (..though after a few washings it becomes considerably softer).  You might not like this textural feeling.\n\n2. Other than the outlast, the pillow is nothing special.  The support is poor like most pillows, the interesting thing here though is that you can remove the stuffing - and fill it with a material you find acceptable (..if you don\'t like the standard poly fill), but you will need to do some minor sewing on the seam you opened to remove and replace the filling\n'

aS"\tInexpensive pump machine that really delivers GREAT espresso\n\tThe feature's on this machine are what drew me to choose Krups Espresso Maker. The pump instead of the pressure machines was the first draw. The water tank and its size, not having to fill it every day. The fact that the frothing nozzle moved and the location of it. And nobody makes a frothier frother than Krups makes. I love the lattes and I use a large stainless steel milk steaming pitcher. You can make two cups at once. I use it daily and sometimes more than once a day! It makes a great espresso with beautiful crema. I have not had any problems with this machine.Clean after every use. I can't stress this enough and it only takes a minute to wipe the brew area. And do the internal cleaning with solution often or you will get the slow drips of espresso when brewing because of deposit build ups.  Follow cleaning instructions! \nI highly recommend this one!

It chops , shred , slice but the bad thing is sometimes when making sticky stuff, the stuff goes under the thing that holds the blade and its extremly hard to get out. The other bad thing is the plastic , everytime I use the processor the smell of what I'm making last in the plastic bowl and won't go away until I make something else. And I did clean it very hard. Overall I do Recommend this product to All\n"

Halfway through baking, the batter drips onto the oven floor, causing me to put a muffin tin under the pan. When baked and cooled, the cupcakes broke while popping out\n"

aS'\tOutstanding Value\n\tI researched many roaster pans before I settled on this and am I glad I did. It offers a truly stovetop worthy construction, no bending or warping, a great v rack, and superb heat distribution. The handles are comfortable and the pan fits perfectly in the oven. Compared to the AllClad, it is less expensive and better performance. A well thought out pan\n'

aS'\tNEVER put a carbon steel knife into the dishwasher!\n\tLisa S from Ohio complains that the knives rust very easily and that this is a buyer-beware item.  This is not a buyer beware item. This is an item that requires some knowledge about use and care of carbon steel knives. Carbon steel is an alloy which allows one to hone a very keen edge and it is used for very fine cutting tools in general. It does rust very easily and should always be dried after washing, and even wiped with a little olive oil. These knives cannot be left sitting in dishwater, and they should never be run through a dishwasher. If you want to throw your kitchen knives into a dishwasher, buy cheap stainless steel ones\n'

aS"\tA good little fan.\n\tThis little fan does just what I need it for. A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk. It clips on very well. I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on. I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation. That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful. My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration. There is too much especially on high speed. This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip. It doesn't bother me but might others. The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch. I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan. This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt.\nAll in all very good for my uses. If you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one's for you\n"

aS'\tGood product\n\tI bought this hand blender for making split pea soup.  Using the hand blender made the soup so much creamier.  My husband has Diabetes 2 and he loves his sweets.  I make him the instant, no sugar, no fat pudding and by using the hand blender it becomes very creamy and so much more palatable.  So far the blender is working just great\n'

aS'\tGood but fussy\n\tThis is a pretty good timer with two timing capability, but the only complaint I have with it is that you have to push a minimum of four different buttons just to stop the timer and get it to stop the led screen from flashing.  However, it has very nifty features and the sound of the timer is not too irritating.  Also, the five minute warning is very useful\n'

aS'\tPerfect for New Users\n\tI have never owned a crock pot before, so I was a little apprehensive.  I did a lot of research and finally settled on this item because of size, price and shape of the unit.  I am extremely happy with the product.  It is perferct for a first time user - not too complicated, but has eveything you need to make the most basic or more complicated recepies.  It did not smell at all on first use (many pots have that reputation).  It is very attractive and fits nicely on my countertop.  The inner ceremic part is very sturdy and cleans up very easily.  I do recommend for first-time users that you purchase one good cookbook (many are carried on Amazon).  I purchased several, and my favorite so far is "The Gormet Slow Cooker"  I have tried several recepies and they were all perfect.  I am converted to crock-pot cooking!!\n'

aS"\tMost durable steel I've seen\n\tGot this as part of a wedding gift and couldn't believe how strong and sturdy this is.  I imagined if it fell out of the window of my kitchen into the street from the 2nd floor that it'd have a tiny scratch.  It's a fine container, nice looking, and I'm glad I got it\n"

aS"\tWhat a difference this light makes!\n\tI suspected that a daylight spectrum lamp might be a complete hoax.  I work in an interior office with no view of natural light.  That's 8-10 hours a day in a room with flourescent lighting!\n\nWhen I would come in, I would feel foggy and depressed and unmotivated.  When I would leave, I would feel blinded by the light outside and out of sorts.\n\nSo I bought this lamp on a whim from a Sharper Image Store.  It comes with a brushed steel lampshade, but the store also gave me a white translucent vinyl shade which is what I wound up using.  The light is softly diffused around my workspace.  I can increase or decrease the intensity of the light using the dimmer dial.  And honestly, whether it's psychological or whatever, I feel SO much better since I plugged this thing in!  I am perky, motivated and when I walk outside, I don't feel shocked anymore.\n\nI would recommend this lamp to anyone who works lengthy hours indoors without natural light.  Employers, BUY THIS FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES-IT'S A GODSEND AND IT LOOKS COOL TOO\n"

aS"\tNice Appearance, Poor Construction, and Good Coffee\n\tMy wife and I selected the Krups FME-4 coffee maker to replace the Braun KF550-BK model we've used for the last 2 years.  The Braun was, and still is, an excellent machine.  But it lacked a timer, which the Krups has.\n\nThe Krups has a good clock/timer system that can be a little confusing, unless you read the manual (self-explanatory).  The display uses an LCD that can be difficult to view from some angles.  Overall, it works okay.\n\nThe construction of the Krups is what bothers me the most.  My Braun coffee maker has a filter holder that can stand upright on the counter while I'm filling it with grounds.  This is really useful.  Unfortunately, the filter holder for the Krups is not designed to stand on a counter, so I have to replace it in the coffee maker unit or hold it with my free hand while adding grounds.  This is a big annoyance.\n\nAlso, the review that mentions the uselessness of the water-level indicator on the side of the unit is completely accurate.  Bubbles form in the indicator, making it impossible to read.  Few things bother me as much as a feature that looks great on the packaging, and that's all.\n\nRegarding the carafe, yes, it does spill; but, only if you try to pour too fast.  I had the same problem with my Braun, and just backing off on the angle of the carafe while pouring is enough to keep the coffee in the cup.\n\nOverall, there are some critical design flaws that really shouldn't be present in such a frequently used product; but, it makes good coffee and is fairly simple to use.  In hindsight, I might have instead bought the Braun KF580-BK, which is identical to my current model plus a clock/timer\n"
