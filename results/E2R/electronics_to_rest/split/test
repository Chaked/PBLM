S'\tHorrible DVD player\n\tI have bought and returned three of these units now. Each one has been defective, and finally I just gave up on returning the system. The DVD player constantly gives "Bad Disc" errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc. The sound quality is very nice for the price, but since the player doesn\'t work, it\'s essentially useless. This is a complete rip-off at any price point\n'

aS"\tgood when it works\n\tThe DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality. The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one. I'm using the Plextor DVD burner (love it!!), but I'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand. The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable. It's less the cost that bothers me, but more the time wasted on burning coasters\n"

aS'\tDead On Arrival...\n\tWhile I read the reviews on this machine, it is clear to me that Lexar has some serious quality-control problems. For some people it worked, for others it was a miserable failure. I am in the latter group. Sigh.\n\nMine was dead on arrival. I tried the device with *BOTH* of my Windows-XP machines and in both cases, it was unrecognized. Lexar tech support subsequently proved to be a contradiction in terms as they would not return my email requests for help\n'

aS"\tTotal rip-off\n\tIn the ten minutes since I've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off.  More importantly, It can't handle large manuals as advertised.  (The reason I purchased this particular book holder)  My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter.  Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.  As for me, I'm off to read Amazon's return policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic\n"

aS'\tHad pix loss w/Lexar cards\n\tAbout three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend  and  told her to only use it on pix she didn\'t care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off,  and  I\'ve used all of them,  and  had their (file removal) tech help give up.\n\nIn this day  and  age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn\'t, I use an actual sandisk card, myself.\n\nIf they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven\'t. So that tells me that they don\'t care.\n\nHow important are your pictures to you?\n\n\nFrederic\n'

aS"\tDoesn't pass the test of time\n\tGreat looking keyboard. Unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed. That includes cleaning. And don't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it. The keyboard self destructs after you have the, count them, 10s and 10s of screws.\n\nI called their customer support. They weren't like DELL, nobody is that bad, but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50% off their retail price. shipping was extra. So you save maybe $10 off street prices.\n\nAll-in-all they are no longer the good company they were in the past. They need competition. So I'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement. Too bad they don't make those old keyboards anylonger\n"

aS"\tBetter Not to Buy\n\tI'm the consumer of SanDisk USB flash drives. I have used couple of sandisk flash drives (i.e. 512MB Mini, 256MB Mini) before I bought this product. \n\nPerformance wise this particular product is not doing good. It's taking long time to copy files from my computers. Even it's taking long time to delete files from this disk. So I returned to Amazon and looking for Mini products from SanDisk.\n\nI doubt all the Micro products which is having capacity more than 512MB. Now I'm planning to buy 512MB or 1GB SanDisk Mini USB flash drive.  \n\nBetter buy some good one than wasting your time on this product\n"

aS"\tGood system - one huge flaw\n\tThis is a good product - sounds great, gets good battery life, everything you'd hope for in an iPod dock.  But it has one major flaw.  The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.\n\nIf they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good.\n"

aS"\tgreat product if I could use it\n\tI did the research on this product and it was one of the best. I don't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use. I have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included. One if not the only reason I had purchased it. I e-mailed tiger.com and received no reply. If your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way\n"

aS"\tRIP-OFF: Doesn't advertise that you need an AC adaptor\n\tI would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice\n"

aS'\tCard Error\n\tAfter serveral months of use, "Card Error" was shown on my Canon Digital Rebel for my 512MB Viking card, which was half full with pictures. Fortunately, I just lost a few of pictures.  I tried to format the file; "Card Error" kept occuring on my Rebel.  This 512MB Viking card is now used for my data files.  \n\nProbably, 512MB Viking cards are not designed for high Mega Pixel camera and taking many shots in a short period of time (i.e. 3 shots/sec.).  My Canon A40 has no problems when used with the 512MB Viking card so far.  Probably, I am going to buy a 512MB card from Sandisk or Simple Tech\n'

aS"\tBad Disc Error - possible fix\n\tBAD DISC ERROR - possible fix\n\nAfter about 8 months just like the other reviewer it stopped working.\n\nI kept getting bad disc error on a new DVD I bought. I tried good discs that worked before but now got the same Bad Disc error.\n\nThis is not the first time I had problems loading. Previously, unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem.\n\nThis time after two weeks of Bad Disc errors, I was about to toss it when I decided what the heck, I'll check inside to see if it's dirty or something.\n\nFIRST I UNPLUGGED THE UNIT.\n\nI removed the 6 screws holding the cover. You may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off.\n\nWith my expertise knowledge. *eyeroll* I nudged the lense mechanism. It apparently slides to read the discs.\n\nI plugged the DVD in and loaded a disc again to see what happens. The lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc. I'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day! lol\n\nSo hopefully this will last a little longer. But at least I can use it again for now ...\n\nI am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error. The viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers\n"

aS"\tGreat product! For two days!\n\tWhen this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since.\n\nI didn't expect it to last forever, but less than an hour?\n\nYes, it has a 1 year warranty: just send the unit back with a money order ($6) to cover the return postage. Of course, then you're spending more in postage than you originally spent for the unit..\n"

aS"\tPanasonic CD player is not continuous\n\tThe Panasonic CD player has a good sound quality, but does not automatically change from one CD to the next.

aS"\tYou get what you pay for . . .\n\tI purchased this wireless card based on the price, figuring that even if it didn't live up to the good reviews here, I would only be out ~$20.  The set up was easy and smooth, but the card won't stay connected to my wireless network.  I've got a Belkin wireless router.  The Trendnet signal meter generally shows ~95% signal strength, but the connection only lasts for a few minutes, and I have to keep cycling the connection to regain network access--very annoying.  I know there's nothing wrong with the network because my laptop's connection is stable.  I purchased a D-Link card, and it has worked flawlessly.  Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging when the Trendnet card arrived; if I hadn't, then this card would be on its way back to Amazon now.  Like the title of my review says: you get what you pay for . . .\n"

aS'\tUnreliable - voice unit keeps breaking\n\tMy company supplies these cordless headsets to its employees so I have alot of experience using headsets.  This is the latest upgrade and it is the worst unit I have ever used.  It works great for about 3 or 4 months on average.  After that, the voice unit stops working.  I can hear others speaking to me but no one can hear me.  I have gone through 4 of these units in 13 months and the longest lived unit lasted  and lt; 5 months.  One broke after  and lt; 2 months.  Other colleagues have complained about the same thing happening with their units.  After the experiences I have had with this piece of junk, I would never buy anything from Plantronics with my own money.  Avoid this rubbish\n'

aS'\tTerrible... spend the money and get the D-Link DWL-G730AP\n\tWe travel quite a bit, both business and pleasure, domestic and international... so the idea of a pocket wireless router was a God send.  We bought this one at the beginning of our annual leave (aka tour the US in a month).  We\'d heard good things about the D-Link but with the rebates, this one was practically free.... there was a reason it\'s always on sale.  \nIt took forever to set up.  The old firmware is buggy, the new firmware is difficult and touchy to install.  The router itself does not seem to be compatible with most personal cable/DSL modems.  Out of the eight houses we were in, it would only work with one, although it appeared to connect with several others.  It did work with the Ethernet connection of about 70% of the hotels... but that\'s not a great average.  It also gets very very hot and than will quit working until it cools down again.  Frustrating.\nAfter the first week we went out and got the pocket D-Link.. excellent- plug it in and it works EVERYWHERE: personal homes, questionable modems, hotels, etc... we have used it from Alabama to Bangkok and everywhere in between.  It\'s also about half the size of the Netgear.  Save the hassle and get it first.\n... also a tip, pick up a little usb wi-fi adaptor with your router.  You will find that many people without a wireless router already, will only have a desktop, and you will need to make it "wireless" as you will be connecting their modem to your router.\n'

aS'\tNot  Acceptable for Multi-user or WEP Access\n\tI hoping to use the WGR101 to provide wireless, encrypted access to two laptops from a wired ethernet connection in a hotel. It worked fine in single-user, no encryption mode but that is not what I needed. I experienced severe problems trying to use it in single user mode with WEP or in multi-user mode with and without WEP. One or both laptops would lose the ability to connect to the internet at seemingly random intervals. Sometimes cycling the laptop wireless radio would restablish the connection, sometimes I had to reboot the laptops, sometimes I had to reboot the WGR101, and sometimes I had to reboot the laptops and the WGR101. Stay away from this product unless single user, unencrypted access is what you need\n'

aS"\tSerious problems\n\tPerhaps I got a lemon, but I feel wary of buying another DT200V for 2 reasons:\n\n\n1.  From the day I got it, the power button was so sensitive that a tiny waft of air (no kidding) would turn it off (or back on) at whim.  Right in the middle of a song, or talk, this shortly became maddening.\n\nSince this is unacceptable for a $50-range radio; and since I didn't want to spend as much money mailing it to and fro as it was worth, instead of sending it back -(OH looking back, how I should have!)- I opened it up myself, and had to physically shave down the plastic underside of the on/off button where it touched the internal power switch.  As I couldn't conversely move the guts further from the button, this was the only solution.\n\nThankfully this worked, and the on/off button did not give me further problems after this.\n\n\n\n\nHowever,\n\n2.  Not many weeks or months of use in, the radio developed this habit of shorting out or something to where my pre-set stations just scanned as blank 'fuzz' (no station, not even 'intelligent' fuzz/crackle like it knew a station existed anywhere on the planet) and I could get zero stations of anything at all--not FM, not AM, and no TV.\n\nThis would happen right after turning the radio on, and I should note that I always used headphones (not the ones supplied; as with most, throw them away, they're not worth it).  It seemed to me through trial and error that just turning the radio on was fine, but the act of plugging in some headphones joggled some connection or shorted something out, and did this.\n\nI tried several different pair and types of headphones (some with noise cancelling switches, some without, and with these On and Off), and used the 'lock' switch on the radio both in the on and off position while plugging in my headphones (as the company I bought them from recommended turning the lock switch on when changing batteries, to prevent shorts), but nothing I have done has prevented this from eventually happening again...repeatedly.\n\nIt is really annoying when it does, as removing the batteries (which always will lose all your presets, by the way) and waiting several minutes rarely clears the short.\n\nWeirdly, the thing I've found which clears the short or re-makes whatever connection is messed up correct itself, is opening up the back (screwdriver required) and kind of pushing the guts (board) one direction or another, kind of scooting it (there's minimal movement available, though), and saying a little prayer and putting the whole thing back together again.  Most of the time, that has worked.  Occasionally, I've had to repeat the process 3-5 times before it will.\n\nSometimes it lasts several weeks before this'll happen again, other times, it happens multiple times a day.  The day I can't fix it (I don't even know what I'm doing that's fixing it!), I'll throw it across the room, against a wall, and I probably _won't_ buy another one.\n(If I do, I'm keeping the receipt, NEVER opening up the back as it voids any warranty, and returning it (not for repairs--for a refund!) the split second it gives me any trouble of any kind.)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all this, I grudgingly say that it does have very good reception quality of FM (I almost exclusively listen to this), pulls the stations in nicely, and has very low amount of static.  When one particular station does, it's usually more the fault of distance, or we're getting out of range, or the batteries are very low- that's at fault.\n\nIndoors in a computer-saturated office-cubby environment and not near a window, though, I'd have to say, it has had some significant problems pulling in any more than 3-4 strong-signal stations without major static.  But your office environs may vary.  (Some are more electrical field saturated than most.)\n\nThe FM (musical) sound quality itself is good/decent, and I might say better than many...but my 1 criticism on it is a certain 'canniness' of sound quality (across various headphones I've plugged in).  It's lacking some fullness of the midrange, and warmth.  Also, the bass is not what it could be.  I'm not sure given its overall sound quality signature if the addition of a bass boost button would have helped it or not.\n\nFor me, clarity and volume have helped me ignore some of the lesser aspects of the DT200V's sound signature.  However, shopping for my next purchase, that will move up higher in importance\n"

aS"\tIncompatible, no support\n\tI purchased this device to add to my wireless network, which uses a Belkin wireless router.  I had to connect the router directly to the game adapter since it could not be detected by my wireless router.  After configuring it, I could never find it once it was disconnected from the ethernet cable from my wireless router.  I made three attempts at customer service - my first call was disconnected after 20 minutes, the second call was working with a woman in India, who's headset had a ton of static to add to her accent.  I had to end that session because we couldn't hear each other.  I then used online chat, and after 90 minutes I still had not solved my problem, and that session was disconnected for unknown reasons.  The lady from India did mention that mixing their product with any other wireless router would be a problem, and now I believe her\n"

aS'\tCaveat Emptor\n\tI recently purchased a refurbished Toshiba Gigabeat F40 for about $150. Quite a bargain for a 40-gig MP3 player. However, upon reflection, I regret the purchase.\n\nThe Gigabeat hardware seems to be OK, with good sound quality etc. The major failing is with the included software. As other reviews have pointed out, the Gigabeat will only play encrypted tracks. The Gigabeat is supplied with Gigabeat Room application software to provide the necessary encryption. Gigabeat Room starts automatically when connected to the PC via the USB port. From the time the Gigabeat is connected till the Gigabeat Room application is displayed on the screen is 30 minutes. If you switch from viewing the Gigabeat file directory to the PC file directory, the application hangs. If you try to update your track library, the application hangs. I have yet to get  through a single operation from beginning to end without the program hanging. Every time the Gigabeat Room hangs, you have to restart the application, with yet another 30-minute wait to resume. The file directory on the Gigabeat is usually out of sync with what is actually present on the hard drive. Microsoft Media Player version 10 may also be used to synchronize the Gigabeat. I have a 35-gig library. It took Media Player 18 hours to encrypt and copy all 8100 tracks to the Gigabeat. In short, be prepared for a maddening and time consuming experience with this player. Software that gives error messages such as "The Program Is Quitted" and with such obvious fragility may have been expected in 1986 but is absolutely unreasonable in 2006.\n\nIn my estimation you would be much better off purchasing an MP3 player, even at greater cost, that can play MP3 files directly, with file maintenance provided by Windows Explorer and or Media Player.\n'

I have a good 40 mile drive one way (not city or metropolitan driving) and in that span, I'll have to switch channels between 3 to 5 times. \nKudos to Amazon's hassle free return policy, I was able to return it and get the Belkin TuneBase FM which I highly recommend\n"

aS"\tDon't Buy this Ink Hog\n\tDon't even accept it as a freebie (as I did) unless you are prepared to pay $1.15 per sheet for color ink.  That was my experience with the first color cartridge, which was fully consumed on a total of 20 sheets, 12 of which were heavy color, the others being mixed color and text or very light color.  At $17.99 per color cartridge and $14.99 for black I calculate the outrageous, obscene $1.15 per sheet figure for ink.  This is about six times greater than the average ink cost for my old HP720c, which unfortunately does not work with my new HP Pavilion PC (no printer port on this model, among other issues).  I have vowed to not purchase any HP product in the future if I can possibly avoid it.  I just ordered a Canon Pixima to replace this ink hog.  On the positive side, the print quality is good, speed is excellent, and color fidelity is fair.  The software installed without incident, and the machine is easy to operate, but the HP software is overbearing and constantly trying to sell you something--worse than daytime television\n"

I first tried the Motorola 7081 and found that unsatisfactory. \nMy next attempt was the Panasonic KX-TG6700B. This phone has decent volume and clarity at the base. The handset has good clarity and range but the volume could use a little help. The base layout is ok but the way you turn on the answering machine at the base is silly. The handset feels light and chintzy. The clarity of the outgoing messages on the answering machine is poor.  The base is ugly; what were they thinking? \nAnyway, it ok, not wonderful.

Apparently I am typing in the wrong WEP pass.... I can assure you I am not.  Perhaps there is an issue between Micro$oft and D-link I am unaware of...go figure.

aS"\tAn interesting-looking, but useless, blinking bit of plastic\n\tMicrosoft has never failed to disappoint me, (I suppose there is something to be said for consistency) and this carries on that somewhat dubious tradition. I bought this with a the MN-700 wireless router, and both worked fine for a couple weeks. However, they both conspiratively proceeded to stop functioning. This card was the most maddening of the pair, because it would find the wireless network every once in a while, yet refuse to connect. I've tried every channel, and made sure its on infrastructure mode, but it still refuses to work. I suppose I deserve it, though, expecting that a microsoft wireless card would connect to a microsoft wireless router with a microsoft operating system. Do yourself a favor and buy your wireless networking from a decent company that has some expertise in networking, like Linksys or Belkin. Whatever you do, give as little money as possible to this shoddy company\n"

I can't tell you how many times a call has gone dead in the middle of a conversation, with no warning, no low battery message. I've only had the phone since November. There is not a quick, convenient way to redail numbers--you have to choose from a list of options, 1-plus number, or the area code without the 1, or no 1 and no area code. No easy way to speed dial. Range is disappointing. I'm looking for a new phone. Back to Uniden or Panasonic\n"

aS'\tDisappointed with DPH-50U\n\tOn the good side, it was easy to set up, and worked reasonably well if the phone (tried both cordless and corded) was plugged directly into unit. However, I could not get it to work on other phones in the house when I used the jack to plug it into the wall per the instructions (so it would work like a land line on any phone in the house). I do not have a land line, so it may just need a land line to work since you are supposed to be able to switch back and forth. I even tried disconnecting the line outside the house but that didn\'t work either. \n\nI experience sporatic dropped calls that were not present before installing this device. I contacted tech support and was sent a driver upgrade v 1.20 (not available from their website). This seemed to improve the dropped call situation a bit, but I still have more dropped calls than before. \n\nThe dealbreaker for me was after I found out you had to be logged in as an administrator for it to work. With an "always on" internet connection, I was not willing to expose myself to that security risk\n'

aS"\tRight click is tricky\n\tAfter two weeks of use, I returned the mouse because 3 out of 4 times I tried to make a right click, it would not work. I eventually got frustrated and decided to return it.\nI'm sure it has to do with the way I use the mouse but I'm not planning on changing my angle or whatever it is that makes it fail. I think a regular 2 button mouse is just perfect.\nI wish this mouse had a real mechanical right button because it would be perfect.\nI LOVED the scroll wheel and will miss it greatly\n"

aS"\tNot ready for primetime...\n\tI'm a longtime user of Wacom Intuos tablets and I was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual 2.5ghz-G5. There were no wireless Intuos products available at the time of purchase, so I went with the Graphire Bluetooth. Unfortunately, the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use, I plan on returning it. The major problem lies with the pen--both in design and responsiveness. \n\nDesign: the Graphire series is cheaper than the Intuos, and there's a good reason why: the Graphire pen is thinner, lighter, and has no grip. If you have very small hands this might be acceptable; in my hand this feels like a toothpick. It's very difficult to manipulate a tool effectively when it doesn't feel like it has any durability. Additionally, the Graphire pen stand is little more than a piece of transparent molded plastic and slides around the desk whenever I put the pen back into it.\n\nResponsiveness: There is a half-second delay whenever using the pen to click in any finder-related options--opening windows, selecting files, etc. 1/2 second may sound acceptable, but if you, like me, use the pen for everything, not just drawing, believe me it is utterly maddening. On the other hand, the mouse behaves perfectly with no delay at all, so I know it's the pen and not my computer.\n\nThe tablet is attractive and the mouse works fine, but the bottom line is that it's more important for me to have a responsive, durable pen than a wireless tablet. If you've never used an Intuos you may not recognize the deficiencies, but for those who have, this is like going from a Mercedes to a Honda Civic. You'll get better gas mileage with the Civic but the Benz gives you the  best overall driving experience. I need the driving experience, so I'm going back to the Intuos--wire and all.\n"

aS"\tP.O.S.\n\tI know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman\n"

aS'\tSub Woofer Problems\n\tAfter only a couple of months of light use, the sub woofer started making loud thumping sounds and the system stoped working.

aS'\tPoor battery life\n\tI have to agree with many others about the poor quality of this phone.

aS"\tSo quiet, it didn't work at all\n\tI lost my adapter that came from Walmart and was a generic brand.  It worked perfect.  This thing was expensive and it didn't work at all.  I'd have to turn the volume on both the ipod and stereo all the way up and then I'd get some sign of life, not anything you'd want to listen to. It's worst than even the worst RF transmitter I've ever tried.  Don't waste your money, believe the reviews\n"

aS"\tAn expensive piece of garbage\n\tI bought this thing becuase I use voice recognition with my computer and I'm on the phone quite a bit. it was supposed to eliminate the need to for two head sets.  With the amplifier and the plantronics headset to go with it The total cost came to around $200. Yay! \n\nThe amplifier has a strong hum when used through the phone and when I use it witht eh computer it has such poor sound quality that it doesn't work with my voice rec. software. I called customer service and they said I should send the unit to them and they would send me a new one. Funny,  I have read that in a few places online.   \n\nI went out and bought the Labtec equivelent, the dialog-301 at a whopping $15 (headset included, the head set is cheap though) and it is chrystal clear for both the phone and my computer. Plus if you want to upgrade the head set you can buy any analog computer headset. \n\nSave yourself $185 and just buy the dialog-301 you will be happy.\n"

aS"\tAgain, Monster has to be kidding (and they are)\n\tFor some years I tried this and other Monster products, to the tune of over $1000 in Monster a/v gear. The more you learn about video and audio, the more you'll avoid anything with the Monster label. Specifically, this s-video meets no NTSC, DVD or IEEE standard; it is common 30-ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed, low-conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding. Has a sharp image, but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off-color skin tones to color blotching, dirty grays, burned highlights, murky shadows, noisy reds, and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds. Makes video test patterns look great, but who watches test patterns all day? Amazon offers many other brands at good prices, why waste your $$ on this stuff? I removed every piece of Monster from my system and replaced them with AR, Belden, Viewsonics and others from Amazon. Result: vast improvement in every respect.\n"

aS'\tDisappointed and Feeling Ripped Off\n\tI bought these headphones based on the first couple of reviews I read here.  I should have read further, because about two weeks after I purchased the earphones, the left side went out completely.  There was nothing obvious on the outside of the unit and I didn\'t hear any "rattling" as described by other users.  The darn things just quit!  I must say, however, that the sound quality for those first two weeks was excellent, but all in all, not worth the money and frustration\n'

aS"\tNot even worth a star\n\tI bought this unit over a year ago and still haven't figured out how to work it.

This is after hours with their customer service people and doing everytihing possible. Based on other people's reviews this unit actually does work. It just hasn't for me.\n"

aS'\tGood looks, mediocre performance\n\tI\'ve found these headphones to be highly overrated.  \n\nThe noise cancelling is primarily from the snug fit in the ear.  When the noise circuit is turned on, the background "hiss" becomes incredibly annoying.  To be fair though, this model does remove some background low frequency sound, even in addition to the the noise reduction from the ear plugs.  \n\nThe frequency response during playback sounds like an old am radio\n'
p61
aS"\tBreak easily - even when you take care of them.\n\tIn terms of sound quality, noise cancelling, and general comfort - thise headphones are top of the line. I absolutely love the way the sound and the ammount of noise cancelling that they provide. I used them regularly when mowing the lawn and when flying, and I always recieved the highest quality sound and noise cancelleation. I was even able to listen to drum-n-bass while mowing the lawn and hear all of the appropriate frequencies on the low end. \n\nHowever... inside of 6 months, I have gone through 2 pairs of these headphones because the right ear headphone has gone out on them. The worst part is - I can't even begin to imagine why it goes out. I keep my heaphones in a locked cabinet in my office every night. Last friday, I placed back into the nice little carry bag that they come with, and placed them into this cabinet. This morning when I pulled them out for use, the right ear bud is out again... no physical damage is apparent anywhere on the headphones, and there is not a broken wire anywhere. In fact, the wiring is perfectly fine and still functional. It is the physical earbud - the hard plastic peice - that has gone out. If i squeeze the earbud hard enough, it will turn on again. \n\nSomething inside of the earbud is obviously designed improperly and I would highly recommend that noone purchase these headphones because of this\n"

aS"\tNot for Laptop Users\n\tI got Avaya RoadWarrior up and running on my computer to use when I work remotely. My co-worker told me to get a GN Netcom headset but I figured I'd save some money and get this one. Big mistake.\n\nThere is a major problem with some laptops when the power cord is plugged in, the listener on the other end has what sounds like you in a an airplane during flight. The humming goes away when you unplug the power cord but that doesn't help me, I need to be able to use it when the power cord is plugged in or not.\n\nAnyway, I chatted with Plantronics support and then informed me that it's a known issue with no work around except to unplug the power cord while using it.\n\nSo, it's getting returned.\n"

aS'\tVery large size for travel and mediocre sound\n\tI have several pairs of portable speakers for my laptop but forgot to bring them on a recent trip and bought these based on the glowing reviews posted here. However, when I received the speakers I found that they are much larger in size and much lower in both quality of build and quality of sound than for example the Creative speakers. They have a huge and unstable footprint when opened (about 9 inches long and one inch deep) and are not particularly compact when folded either. The sound is not rich and they eat batteries amazingly fast, then begin to buzz. I do not recommend these speakers\n'

aS"\tSlow, affects entire system\n\tNote: I am fully aware that compact flash cards have a maximum sustained upload speed which caps off the potential speed of the medium it is being transferred on.\n\n\nI purchased this product to use in conjunction with my SanDisk Ultra II compact flash cards.  I thought that PC cards would be faster than USB 1.1 and 2.0, but thats not the truth.\n\nWhenever I try to upload files from my CF cards thru the PC card, it slows down the ENTIRE system.  I can't do other tasks while the card is uploading files since everything is acting sparatic and slow.\n\nI'll admit, the card is a bit faster in uploading files than USB 1.1, but I can't do anything else on my computer while the card is working.  Honestly, I would rather have a little bit slower performance with my USB 1.1 card reader and be able to work on my computer at the same time instead of having the card slow down my entire system.\n\nI believe this card is a 16-bit pcmcia card.  I've heard good praise for Lexar's 32-bit pcmcia cards, but I have yet to try it out.  I'm sure it costs more money than this PC card or a USB card reader, though...\n\n\nAll in all, I suggest getting a USB 2.0 compact flash reader over this product if you want to work on your computer at the same time as you are uploading files.\n\nOtherwise, if your the kinda person who doesnt mind leaving the computer alone while the files are uploaded to your computer, this will work just fine for you\n"

aS"\tBeware if there are few unused frequencies in your area\n\tI purchased the Kensington after my casette adapter developed an annoying wheel noise. I heard and read a lot about the problems with FM transmitters, like static and audio quality but the Kensington was the best rated unit.\n\nIt arrived the day before I had to take a business trip and thought it would be a great test. The first day I used it, it seemed to work great. The next day on my return trip home, all I got was static and could barely hear the music from my iPod. I tried every station I could find with little or no transmission on it, but the audio quality remained extremely poor.\n\nI am not sure if there are just too many stations broadcasting in the NYC metro area or this particular unit is defective, but since my car has a casette player I will go with casette adapter for now.\n\nIf you have lots of unused frequencies, it might work in your area. Just be sure you can return it if it doesn't work out for you.\n"

aS"\tThrown Together Phone\n\tIt looked flashy and well-conceived on the web shopping sites that featured it; however, after setting up Panasonic's KX-TG5576M, I'm underwhelmed...    First of all, even in this day and age, it's not Mac-compatible (though the Pansonic Call Center Representative had assured me, after checking with her Superior, that it indeed was.)   So,  I cannot comment on downloading ringtones, wallpapers, etc.   (Meanwhile, these mobile phone-like features were the main reason I wanted this particular cordless phone).\n\nSecondly, the built in digital message recorder is of the lowest quality.   I was looking for an alternative to the monthly charge for voice mail through the phone company.    This isn't it. If you prefer to record your own message in lieu of the generic built-in message options, your Callers will here something sounding like a worn-out Edison recording.   It struck me as odd that with the included audio cable, you can connect the handset to an audio device with a headphone jack, to record custom ring tones, with good quality results.  Yet, to record a message for the digital answering machine, you need to speak into the dinky little microphone hole on the base unit, with the aforementioned low sound quality.  \n\nFinally, the battery life of the handset is rather short.  This is despite the (too) low backlighting on the handset keypad.  Oh, why no backlighting on the base unit?\n"
p68
aS'\tVery unhappy with this product\n\tThese speakers were a major disappointment.  I have speakers that are about 5 years old, and wanted to replace them.  But these Sony speakers were AWFUL - the sound was tinny, the bass was almost non-existent, and the sound was probably worse than that coming from my built-in laptop speakers.\n\nAnd these weren\'t even the "cheap" speakers - there were many sets that cost less than this.  If you care at all about the quality of the speakers, spend another $20-$30 and get a decent set... don\'t buy these..\n'

aS"\tShort battery life\n\tUsing Rechargeable AAA batteries, with the Battery Saver feature turned on, about two hours. Sometimes I get more using alkalines, but not much more. Honestly, this unit is worthless, because I can't trust the batteries.\n\nOrder a Garmin Etrex Legend instead. It isn't much more expensive, larger or heavier, and it includes a base map of roads, towns, and shorelines. The Legend comes with a cable to transfer data from your computer. The Legend's screen is a bit larger, but shows much more detail. And - the batteries last hours and hours.\n"

aS"\tHave an iBook? Don't buy this lock!\n\tI posted a review two weeks ago, but it hasn't appeared, so I'm trying again...I bought this lock two years ago.  It has always been difficult to remove.  (Note:  despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.)  Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus\n"

aS"\tGreat mechanics but the coffee taste is lost...really lost.\n\tWe drink a lot of coffee all day, every day.  So we decided to convert to a thermal carafe coffeemaker in order to keep our coffee hotter and fresher-tasting.  We first bought the 10-cup Capresso MT-500 which we loved except for the carafe which leaked slightly.  The coffee was perfect everytime and the taste great.  Unfortunately the control panel burned out about a year and half after we bought it.  So instead of another expensive Capresso replacement, we decided to try a Japanese model which we thought might be more reliable.  We have been using the Zojirushi for 2 weeks now and it works perfectly.  No leaks and it just feels more mechanically reliable than the Capresso.  Unfortunately, there is no water filter system in this model compared to others (we had taken this for granted and not checked for it).  And no reuseable metal mesh filter (that I could find on the market) instead of paper filters.  The water also does not seem as hot when it goes into the coffee grounds.  We are not sure why our coffee just doesn't taste very good anymore, but we definitely have noted a real sharp drop in taste quality.  Today, we pulled out our very old Krups ProAroma model and have noted a definite taste improvement.  We will use this and the Zojirushi thermal carafe until we get a new Capresso coffeemaker replacement.  Don't waste your money on this Zojirushi model unless you don't care about taste.  It was money thrown out the window as far as we are concerned.  Even mediocre coffee beans are too expensive to use with this machine\n"

aS'\tAcer 1916AB\n\tFor over eight years (nearly 9), I had an Acer 17" CRT  and  loved it. I use a KVM to switch computers,  and  the CRT kept all of my adjustments for that computer, every time.\nWhen it started showing signs of age (about four months ago), I decided to try a flat screen, or LCD, though I\'ve heard horror stories about them, my laptop is great.\n\nI don\'t mind the dark overlay associated w/LCDs, I have that on my laptop. I was amazed at how poorly this monitor responds to things. I still swap computers. I can\'t get the same clarity that I once did.\n\nI swap between ME  and  XP, which shouldn\'t matter.\n\nDon\'t believe there isn\'t any flicker, that\'s wrong. If you change the refresh rate, the monitor changes, not the computer. What happened to dumb monitors (what happened to dumb printers)? Best, should be a button (turn on) away. Some tweaking isn\'t bad.\n\nFade out: I have the monitor, at the "proper" height,  and  the upper  and  lower corners fade. As looking at any lcd from an angle.\nYou can\'t tilt this monitor very much at all\n\nDon\'t spend much time on shut down or re-start in ME, the lines  and  jaggies will kill you.\n\nI\'m sorry that I bought this monitor. The refesh rate for games, is fair. Don\'t play any games prior to ME! Because ME era games fade badly at the ends, nearly blacking out. Post XP isn\'t anything to write home about really.\n\nI would suggest trying out an hdtv first. With a direct (vga) plug in. It\'s a few dollars more, but if you\'re considering an hdtv, as well as a monitor, I\'d chance it. You can always buy a 20" CRT for less.\n\nI hope this helps\n'

aS'\tCheap  and  Buggy\n\tThe features, size, and design of this unit are what drew me in. But after just a few uses, I quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive, but completely unusable package. To start with, the unit is small - the smallest of its kind. But the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace. Second, the unit has a built-in rechargeable battery that cannot be removed. So, when it crashes, which it does frequently, there is no way to "cold-boot" the unit by removing the battery. This is also a problem because it reduces the unit\'s true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no AC power to recharge it. Then, what you have is a paperweight. Oh, and by the way, when you do have it plugged in to charge, the backlight is always on (even if the power is off). So forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either.\n\nBut, all of this aside, the firmware simply does not work. It locks up incessantly and, with no way to reboot, you literally have to unplug it, wait for it to auto-power-off, and hope that you can start the machine up again. And, to add insult to injury, the body is a cheap Chinese-made piece of plastic with absolutely no meat on its bones.\n\nOverall, don\'t be taken in by the low price. Paying any amount of money is too much for a unit that doesn\'t work\n'

aS"\tCompletely Useless For Me\n\tI wanted to connect a computer to a router, and the computer was going to be pretty far away from the router.  So I figured I needed a long cord, and decided to get this one, which is supposed to be cat 5 stranded patch (which was what I needed.)  Well, it's long.  That's the only good thing about this cord.  But the bad thing is so bad that the cord is useless.  There is nothing on the ends!  It's just a giant wire!  There aren't any connectors on the ends that I can use to plug the cord into my computer, or the router.  So I have a cord, but no connectors.  It's completely useless, unless I buy the connectors separately, and attach them myself.  Do I know how to do that?  Do I want to do that?  No.   So I'm returning this.  Maybe, if all you need is the cord (it's grey, by the way), and not the connectors, you might be able to use this.  Otherwise, it's completely useless.  If you can't find any cords this long that have connectors, maybe you should consider trying a shorter cord.  ..\n"

aS"\tWarning about the Ipod\n\tI have really enjoyed my I pod until I started to get errors in January 2006. I started to get an error that state that Itunes can't read to or write form the Disk meaning the Ipod itself. That means I cannot add music to or take music off of the Iopd. This was very upsetting to me as I have had this item for less than a year. I Finlay called tech support at Apple. They asked for the serial# for my Ipod. They told me it was out of warranty, that the warranty had expired in December of 2005 and there was NOTHING I could do, literally. I checked my purchase and found out that I had purchased this on April 7, 2005. I was so angry that they would tell me that it was out of warranty when it clearly was not.

After that everything seemed to be OK but some strange noise in headphones.   \nCons: failure/malfunctioning while operating the radio.\nPros: \t- great sound (with other than manufacturer provided headphones);\n\t- long operating time using rechargeable battery;\n\t- excellent expandable via SD cards feature;\n\t- I love the flip display capability.\nI really love that device because of its features and I hope it was only my mischance getting a damaged one. However I requested Amazon the replacement of the device instead of reimbursement. I also already advised some friends to buy that device.\nAs a good point for Amazon, the very fast answer when I requested the replacement of the device. \nI will come back with updates after I receive the replacement. Hope a good one next time.\nThank you Amazon Team.\n\nComing back after receiving the replacement device.\nFirst of all it was a very good idea buying Amazon fulfilled products even it was a bit more expensive than other sellers. The replacement came faster than the product. Excellent Amazon Team and very professional. It's a pleasure doing business with you.\nThe device works perfectly. \nReally a device you must have. \nMore than that, my friends I recommended the mp3 player are very happy with their new acquisition.  They were luckier than me. \n5 Stars for the product now.\n"

aS"\tToo many problems\n\tI had a D-link USB adaptor before which was really good, but was old.  I upgraded to a wireless G Linksys USB adaptor, but I was supplied with old goods (a Linksys sales manager confirmed that), so I sent that back.  I thought I'd try D-Link again.  Bad move.  First, I tried to upgrade the drivers.  My current version was 1.0.5.0.  I downloaded the version 1.12 from D-Link's site.  After uninstalling and reinstalling (several times) I still had 1.0.5.0.  An hour and a half on the phone with D-Link tech support and I still had 1.0.5.0.  Another hour on Google, and I'm not the only one with this issue.  Seems to be a version-control issue with D-Link.  Then, even more irritating, every time after I use my wired connection and go back to wireless I have to reinstall the drivers and reboot.  And re-enter all my security info again.  (I believe this has something to do with using a different USB port from the last time, but whatever the reason, it's unacceptable).  This adaptor's going back too.  Don't know what I'll try next.\n"

After deleting all of the photos from this card, the capacity had suddenly decreased to only half! What happened to the other 1 gigabyte? I'm sure they pre-formatted this card to appear like it's 2 gigabytes, but what a surprise when you start using it. Not good\n"

aS'\tNOT SO GREAT AS THEY SAY.JUST OK\n\tThese radios look nice but there are some problems here. First the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk. Second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands. The receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times. I also hace a T7200 and the difference is like night and day. The 7200 is the best. The 7400 i believe is an has flaws and that is why you see them priced so low. I paid $24.00 on ebay and also have seen the set at home depot clearance for $44.00 today. What good is any radio if you cant understand what someone is saying? Good try motorola but this is a poor product.NOT RECOMMENDED TO PURCHASE\n'

aS'\tLow quality\n\tAfter only having the cable for a week under very light usage, the cable stopped working intermittently. It makes crackling noises when the cable is moved. I am not talking about whipping or quick movement, just gentle movement of the cable causes crackling and loss of signal. I was about to scrap the cable altogether but I decided to resolder the connector to see if that would help. I cut off about half a foot of the cable and resoldered it, only to find that the same problem persisted. I got a bad cable, obviously..\n'

aS"\tDid not work-avoid this product\n\tThe iM3c was a gift - looked like a great little portable stereo for my Pod. First used it on a trip. Started off playing ok and then the sound cut in and out. Frustrated me for the week as I didn't know if it would play or not on any given day. When it did play it was ok but not great. Finally, it didn't play anymore.\n\nReturned it to the Apple Store where purchased to find that there was only a 15 day return policy and I missed it by 2 days. So, I tried to contact Altec Lansing. The phone number in the owners book didn't work although I tried for several days. Then I emailed the Altec support email. No response after two emails.\n\nSometimes a product doesn't work and it's easy to return or get repaired. On this one, it looks like this product will be finding the trash can.\n\nDo not buy.\n"

aS'\tShort lived performance\n\tI bought the TDK Mojo 256 about a year and 3 months ago. It worked wonderfully for the first year - did what it was supposed to and the radio quality was great. Then I upgraded to Windows XP and that\'s when everything started going wrong. This MP3 player needs propreitary software to copy files from your hard disk or CD to the mp3 player. Unfortunately the software doesn\'t work well at all with XP. Right now, my player is piece of junk. I have tried copying files which it shows as copied but then when you reconnect the player, they don\'t show up on there. What\'s more, formatting the internal memory will also not release the space and so I have the internal memory full but it shows up in the software as free. However, it won\'t copy over any new files and gives me a "Storage Full" error. It doesn\'t act reliably with XP either and I had to unplug and replug several times for it to even read the list of songs on the mp3. It lasted all of 15 months. While it sounds like a great deal ( good features for price ). DO NOT buy this if you will be using it with XP and if you do, please don\'t expect it to last more than 12-15 months\n'

aS"\tDumb dumb dumb\n\tWhat do they say about fools and money?\n\nHDMI uses TMDS which is a digital transmission system with built-in error correction. TMDS has been designed to work over cheap cabling and a $10 HDMI cable will meet the specification. If you spend 9 times more on this cable than another one then you have just wasted $80. That's all there is to it. \n\nYou don't need expensive shielding or gold plated connectors for a cable. The picture or the sound are not richer or more vibrant with a $90 cable over a $10. In fact the signal is identical. Let me repeat - HDMI ( and  DVI-D) devices talk digitally with error correction. This cable and ones like it are for suckers only.\n"

The router works perfectly fine. The USB adapter gave me so much trouble. i used it to connect my desktop pc to wireless network. It works when the network is not encrpted. But it won't find an IP address under WPA security. It searches IP address endlessly. I have winxp sp2 which is supposed to support wireless flawlessly. I think either this so-called 108m bps or the driver causing the trouble. Having seen others having problem with other brands of USB adapter, i think maybe for desktop, a wireless pci card is better\n"

aS'\tIf you like headaches and hassles, buy this router\n\tThis may be one of the cheapest routers out there, but it\'s cheap in every way. I spent hours either on hold or talking with poorly trained overseas "tech support" whose expertise consisted of (barely) reading a script. Eventually these computer whizzes determined that my D-Link router didn\'t work. They told me to send it back (on my nickel, of course), and they sent me another one, which also did not work, at least not with my computer system. After more wasted hours, I was referred to the one guy at D-Link who--supposedly--has mastered this router\'s bugs. The problem? He never answered the phone. And despite all my calls to him and all my voicemails asking him either to call me at work or to set a time for us to talk, he repeatedly returned my calls at 3:00 in the afternoon, the time when most people who can afford routers are working. Finally I had an epiphany: Life was too short to %* and #@ with D-Link. I packed up the router and sent it back to the CEO, Stephen Joe, with a letter. Then I went out and bought a Netgear router, and I was up and running in minutes. Mr. Joe never responded to my letter, but what else do you expect from a company that so clearly doesn\'t value its customers\n'

aS"\tI've just replaced my set of these\n\tI've had a set of these batteries for a year or two now. The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera, I've had the same problem: I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later, I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day, having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.\n\nAfter missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries, I'd had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin, and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them.\n"

aS'\tBe wary.\n\tWhile certain labels with this software are much more easier to work with such as the CDs and the general labels, I found this product much less than satisfactory.  \n\nThe inserts and the software don\'t align too well and are a few centimeters off...especially on the lower half of the page.  If one wants to keep the insert regardless of whether or not the "cut offs" are present it would be best if the paper was inserted within the opposite position in the paper tray in the printer so one can cut to the size needed.\n\nOtherwise, I would suggest what another Amazon customer has done. Use cardstock paper....at least for the back inserts.  And trim with either a scissors or paper cutter.\n\nA product should do what it promises it will do.  Unfortunately, this one does not.  At least, within my experiance this does not measure up to what was previewed within the Memorex beginner\'s package w/ CD label stamper.  \n\nTwo stars for at least being able to print the front side.  Although it would have been nice if they had said so without stating they could do both when they cannot\n'

aS"\tWill do...\n\tI have used these labels for a long time, mostly because they seem to be the only ones out there.

I would love to see Memorex make a package with glossy  paper/high end paper. Maybe Epson will beat them to it\n"

aS'\tLittle to offer over the GPS 12\n\tI really love my Garim GPS 12. It is easy to use and move between screens and features. The Summit is not as easy to use. It is not as convenient to identify way points, does not work with mapping software and its display is to simple. It was not a step up but sideways. I use it in conjunction with my GPS 12 mostly just to keep the track log\n'

Less than 6 months later, in November 2006, I heard a strange noise while using the monitor and all of the sudden the screen went very bright -- like an overexposed photo. I'm currently working with Viewsonic to get it repaired (I must mail it to CA to be repaired, postage must be paid by me). All in all a disappointment and a hassle. Next time I'll buy a name brand\n"

aS"\tGreat looking maps, can't find its way out of a paper bag.\n\tI logged 870 miles with the iway 350.  270 miles around maryland it was / is a great item. I took it on our first trip to New York and Long Island and it was terrible. The first problem occurred on the New Jersey turnpike. I was supposed to use the turnpike from start to exit 18 and at exit 4 we stopped to eat. The unit said I was off course because the rest area was 100 feet from the highway. However when we returned to the highway the unit could not chart the course any more. It said I was doing 95 miles a hour when i was doing 70, and it would lose satellites and go searching for them in the middle of the highway no obstructions of any kind anywhere. I even pulled over at exit 6 and we waited for 20 minutes to see if we just needed to stop the car for it to do the job. It did not recalculate our course until after exit 18 some 100 + miles from when it acted up. We even tried a full restart and cancel route and retried again from the address book and from direct typing the information again. About 1 mile from our destination it worked for 2 blocks and was lost again. Then after 2 more blocks we found where we where going. We often get lost on this trip this is why we purchased the unit. Then on the trip from the Bronx to Long Island a 30 mile trip it stopped 5 blocks into the journey and was recalculating. I had to call the people we where visiting and they directed us by phone. However about 1 mile from their place it started working again. We used it on long island with no trouble at all. Then on  trip back to the Bronx it worked pretty good only losing its position once on a major highway no trees or obstructions. Then on our way back from the Bronx to long Island it was lost half the way finding position and calculating . The same exact way we went in both directions but it was clearly not right leaving the Bronx. On our way back to Maryland it operated pretty good after a short stretch of lost signals and redirecting and we used exactly the same roads in both directions. I did update the software to the new 1.2.0 days before we took the trip.  \n\nAlso charting the 212 mile course to the Bronx NY took close to 20 minutes, then the extra destination to Long Island a 30 mile addition took the Iway 350 30 or so more minutes. I figured with all that time the trip home calculations would be faster but I fell asleep after waiting  over a hour for it to complete the task. I feel this is one issue the unit has. Longer trips take so long to calculate so when it thinks your off track it takes forever to chart a new course. On short runs under 20 miles it was very fast.\n\nI returned the unit and got a Garmin C530. The C530 is a very nice unit fast in every respect.\n"

aS'\tCompletely unreliable\n\tI bought this since it\'s economical, compact, didn\'t need cabling (although it has an extension if you need it), advertised a whopping 108 mbps. Well so much for that:\n\n1) Drivers are problematic and causes conflicts with XP SP2.  My first ever blue screen of death in about 3 or more years running XP came this item\n\n2) It is EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE:\n\n- already mentioned repeatedly, it overheats\n\n- it drops connections randomly and yes, the only way to re-acquire the signal is to unplug and plug back in\n\n- It\'s utility is worthless, just install the driver (if you can). If you try using WPA, forget about using this utility, just use Windows to configure it. \n\n- I\'ve also found out that it\'s better if you just remove this utility from the STARTUP (don\'t run it at all) so that Windows can do everything it needs to connect, which is faster and more reliable. Be careful not to UNINSTALL, since it will also remove the driver...just remove it from your Windows Startup folder list. Netgear has an FAQ about this problem, but I\'m not going to tweak Windows and risk more stuff for this cheap piece of hardware.\n\n3) 108 MBPS? Yeah right. You\'ll need the RIGHT KIND OF access point/wireless router for this, if not, it\'s 54 mbps. This was one of the selling points, but it\'s definitely a "gotcha". You\'re limited to specfic equipment, specific channel (6), so if you have neighbors on the same channel, well, you get the picture\n'

aS'\tDoes not work, bad service\n\tThe DVD burner connected very easily through USB, was immediately recognized by WinXP, the software installation was fine. I was beginning to feel good. However, whenever I burned a DVD (I tried 4 different brands, some R, some RW etc...), several files would contain errors, and would be completely unreadable. The burning process moreover does not detect this: one needs to verify the data written to check and find these errors. Moreover, the firmware update just does not work on my machine, pardon, machineS. Completely standard Dell machines, all latest WinXP and drivers, good CPUs (3Ghz and up), lots of memory, big hard-drives. I called customer service to try to solve the problem. First of all the average waiting time to get to a technician was about 30 minutes. The rudeness and the plain lies these guys give you are amazing. To make a long story short, I had to call 3 times. First guy: oh, "of course it doesn\'t work, you have EasyCD creator installed!". Ok, I buy it, I go through the (painful) uninstallation process of Roxio\'s software. No problems solved. Second guy: "Oh, of course it does not work, it requires 10Gb of free hard-drive space! It\'s written on the box". Plain lie: on the box it says you need 10Gb for NeroVision (for burning videos), but only 1Gb for Nero. Quarrel (they are tough!) with the guy who could not care less about the fact I got him lying, or that the product description is wrong. Ok, patiently I freed up 10Gb from hard drive, try again, exactly same problem. The only thing they could offer in the end was a replacement. I got perhaps relative lucky because the replacement will be a 720, not a 710, since 710 is not manufactured anymore (wonder why?). Notice I tried this on two different machines (one laptop and one desktop), with identical results.\nOther lie: I noticed, as somebody else here, that the Nero software provided writes only on Sony drives: so if Nero is really the only software that should be installed because of conflicts with Roxio (et al.?), you will never be able to use your own CD drive to burn CDs. How ridicolous is that???? The technician said this is because I had both software(s) installed, but that was another lie.\nThe incompetence of these guys is beyond belief. If the new drive will not work, I hopefully will get a refund through my credit card. You know, the technician even said that that is not possible, credit cards companies do not do that (LOL)\n'

aS'\tNot Compatible with Windows 2000/XP, HORRIBLE Tech Support - AVOID!!\n\tI had this adapter running in my the Cardbus slot of my Windows 98 computer and it ran fine. I installed it on my Windows 2000 laptop. Well, my first sign of trouble was a warning popup when I installed the drivers that the drivers were not certified by Microsoft. So, imagine my shock when my brand new computer constantly got Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crashes. Big blue screen, loss of data, computer freezes tight, power button inoperative, and when you have to use a pin to press that tiny little laptop reset button on a brand new computer, well, we all know that\'s when you\'re in Computer Hell.\n\nI\'m a Microsoft Certified Professional so I was able to narrow down the source of the problem. After definitely identifying the FA511 as the culprit, I contacted Netgear\'s online  tech support. And that\'s when things really started to get ugly.\n\nIt took forever for Netgear to finally give me an answer. This was after days of inactivity, wildly inappropriate responses, and repeatedly requesting same information from me.\n\nFinally, Netgear escalated the problem to their next level of tech support and I was shocked to read their solution: "This is a Windows issue regarding permissions and ***16 BIT*** compatibility mode" While they were vague as to the exact nature of the problem, and contradicted themselves as to whether compatibility mode had to be enabled or disabled, their solution was straightforward: I was directed to a Microsoft Knowledge Base article which tells you how to enable Compatibility Mode - and for 16-bit compatibility mode I had to make my nice clean Windows 2000 computer compatible with Windows 95 (yes, ninety-five).\n\nSo, while the FA511 hardware is a 32-bit Cardbus adapter, apparently their drivers are 16-bit!!! No wonder the FA511 was never certified for Windows 2000. And I wouldn\'t trust it for Windows XP either.\n\nThere are other Ethernet adapters out there by 3COM, Belkin, Linksys, SMC, and Xircom that work flawlessly with Windows 2000/XP by companies that will respond to your questions. Go get them. Avoid the FA511\n'

aS'\tGreat Features, But Huge Flaws\n\tThis music player was decent: Nice look, controls, and sound. There are many nice features including decent software and using it as a data drive. There are really good things about this unit; however, the faults are just too great; thus, superseding the great features.\n\nHowever, the reaction to your key pushes, and file search are way too slow. The software is pretty nice, but the bad thing is that it likes to rename your files for you even when you didn\'t ask it too. That gets very annoying. For example, I just want the file to be named as is, with no tags, but the Zen software will add tags no matter what, even if it has to put in the word "unknown". It also has these strange crashes that makes it hard to have it recover. The worst part about this product is that the earphone jack gets damaged in a few weeks or months -- unprovoked!\n\nIt was so frustrating to think my headphones where damaged, but I switched it up and found out that it was the Zen. Then I read online, and what do you know -- it\'s consensus, the product is faulty because many other people have experienced the same problem. Some people even found some fixes, and I\'ve tried them, but to no avail. But then again, why do I have to fix a fairly new product? \n\nIf you\'re going to have a fault when it comes to a music player, you DON\'T want it to be a physical issue that renders the player useless!\n\nI\'d give it at least three stars as I was quite satisfied with it, but the physical fault with the headphone jack is just too much of negligence to overlook\n'

aS'\tWhoa!!!  Apples and Oranges\n\tSeveral reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace  a composite (L/R audio + video) cable, or an S-video (multi-pinned plug). ALmost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the TV uses different internal circuitry for each one. Virtually any S-video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable, and any component (individual R-G-B video) connection will be better than S-video. Cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it. There may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another, but its almost always unnoticable\n'

aS'\tPanasonic - terrible customer service\n\tAfter two months, this phone stopped working. It was returned to Panasonic Repair and we received a notice thirty days later saying that the phone was back ordered and delivery would be in 6-8 weeks.  This is not customer service. Panasonic should have refunded the purchase price or offered a comparable or better phone. When called today to check on status of order, answer was basically "tough luck." Never again, Panasonic. Amazon should discontinue this brand\n'

aS"\tThe little plastic catch broke in less than a month\n\tI purchased the case along with my new Palm TX to protect it on trips or whenever carrying it. It's a metal shell with a molded plastic liner. The little plastic catch in the lid half, which keeps the case closed, never seemed to work quite correctly, requiring several sliding motions before it would click shut. On a trip on March 3rd, this very small lip of plastic molded into the case broke away. Now it has no catch to keep it closed. Since the case cost me about $24 new and I'd only get about half price for the return, I figure the broken little catch costs me too much to return. I'll use a rubber band around the case, reminding me how flimsy and insufficient the case closing mechanism is. Save your money and don't buy this case. I don't remember reading the reviews before I ordered it -- so there's a $24 lesson\n"

aS"\tNot so hot\n\tOf the various iPod cases I've tried I found this one to be the worst.  The click wheel cover is impractical and annoying and the screen cover falls out all too easily.

aS'\tNot for me (or gamers)\n\tFirst off, I bought this headset for gaming, which anyone who enjoys the pastime will tell you how quickly the hours can melt away. Gamers are dependant on an ultra comfortable pair of headphones that we shouldn\'t be able to feel. I have been searching high and low for the Holy Grail of comfort and I was certain paying $90+ for a "gaming" headset would be the end of my search. Sorry, these guys are going back.\n\nI\'ve tried a couple "cheap" Best-Buy headsets that I found painful to wear after an hour or so. Then I decided to spring for "top of the line". I wore these for 15 minutes before it became obvious this headset was not the Holy Grail I\'ve been looking for.\n\nThe headset itself feels flimsy and cheap. The padding is made of an itchy fabric, and even on my small head, it feels tight. The earphones do not cover my ears and I can feel them slowly being crushed. I\'m not impressed with the sound, but I could overlook that if they were comfortable to wear. I didn\'t even bother to try the mic.\n\nIf this is how Sennheiser makes their high end gaming equipment, I think it\'s safe to say I will avoid these guys in the future. The $30 pair of Aiwa\'s I wear at work are more comfortable than this and sound the same... if only that pair had a mic.\n\n*My ears still feel uncomfortable after taking the set off and then writing this review- I couldn\'t imagine wearing them for a few hours while gaming. If I find the perfect pair I\'ll let you all know\n'

aS'\twaste of money -\n\tthe case looks nice, but not practical. Everytime you need to change the volume or track you have to pull your ipod out.  My ipod had scratch marks on it the first week.  Unfortunately, all the picture you see of this case is from the side view, so you cannot see that there is no opening for the wheel and the display.  I recommend iskin product.\n'

aS'\tSony Walkman Radio\n\tTHe radio works great....except  the last   2 Sony walkman am/fm radios I have had  you were able to CLIP onto your WAISTE band when exercising.....it was just a large CLIP thing....THIS new one has a different type that you HAVE to use a BELT with!   and WHO  uses a belt to work out ?

Otherwise it is a great item\n'

aS"\tNot to spec\n\tI ordered 2 of these, realizing they would have limited adjustment range - other reviews are correct in that they are very limited in their travel. What prompts my one star rating and subsequent return of my order is that they will not hold their rated weight. This model is supposed to hold a 25 lb. monitor; it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb. iMac. There is no tension adjustment (already as tight as it would go) and the computer just flopped forward. With a light monitor, I'm sure it would be fine, but don't expect even close to the stated 25 lb. rating.\n"

aS"\tTwo Strikes I'm Out!\n\tBought one from Amazon, they sat on the order for a week before shipping a unit that arrived dead. Went through the return/replacement process and they sat on the order for over a week this time and the  that one arrived dead with the exact same failure mode. \n\nThe second one looked as if it had been opened before, accessory bag not sealed, manuals out of place, interior packaging worn. I believe the second one they sent was a return that was then resent to me. Bad news!!!\n\nI still had both and in hope of fixing on, I contacted Garmin who said they were indeed broken and offered to fix one and send it back. This would mean I'd have paid full price for what would then be a refurbished unit.  Both of them returned.\n\nI needed the unit right away for a desert trip. Amazon's refund process made it such that they'd not refund all of the funds but hold them on account (those that were originally given to me as a gift certificate from my employer). Therefore I could not get the equipment for a local vendor. \n\nI opened one month nearly to the day dealing with slow order processing, bad units, and more. \n\nSo, I'd not recommend the unit and I think Amazon may need to review their own practices to ensure what they have in inventory is new and likely operational, and that when a customer orders something, they put in the effort to ship it ASAP!!\n\nWithout that, if you have to buy one, go to a local dealer, put that batteries in at that shop and have them prove it works before you leave with it. Since you can't so that here, don't buy it here.\n"

aS"\tOK, but not perfect!\n\tMy first GPS. It was pretty expensive and had lots of nice features (ability to save many tracks). The software is very US-centric.\n\nIt worked very well on the flat and in unwooded conditions. However don't use one of these things to navigate in the bush (use a compass). The technology is just not there to cope with either valleys or an overhead canopy. It was handy to confrm where I was when I found a clearing on top of a hill. Finally although the battery life is better than most it is still abysmal.\n\nIn summary these things are still a toy for a tramper rather than an essential tool\n"

aS"\tadequate for simple recording only\n\tI purchased this in the hope that I would be able to record verbal messages to myself, creative thoughts and ideas, etc. It does an adequate job of that. I had also hoped I could use it as a simple player, to download affirmations and such to listen to throughout the day. This it won't do, and it was not clear to me from the information here and on the Olympus site that it would not function this way.\n\n First, even though it records wav files, it does not let you handle them well at all. To transfer recordings to your computer, you have to install special software (included), but you cannot transfer wav files back to the recorder (according to the software guide). If you want a recorder/player to function easily like that, you should go for the more expensive ones that allow you to use them as a USB flash drive (like the Creative Zen series). I did not install the software, as it offered nothing other than the simple transfer of a recording to my computer. I can record directly to the PC with much higher quality, so why bother? Noise recorded in a high quality format is still noise. It makes more sense to simply repeat anything I record on the Olympus and record it directly to the PC.\n\nSecond, the sound quality is not great. Given that wav files are what are used on CDs, one would expect more than what this device delivers. It is noisy on either of the mic settings, and I would have to describe the sound quality as medium. Don't expect high fidelity. This is a voice recorder for recording quick notes and not much else. Even analog tape would be better for most things. I may be fussier than most about this, having some professional background in audio, so the sound quality may be okay for most people. People have gotten used to lower standards in just about everything.\n\nFinally, playback was very disappointing to me. It has only the simplest playback features. It plays, pauses, fast forwards, and reverses, period. You cannot repeat either a single recording or portion of one, and you cannot create any kind of list to specify only certain files to play. It plays (manually) one recording at a time and that is it. You cannot set markers to fast forward or reverse to (like chapters on a DVD), and searching through a recording of any length is a major pain. In fact, this recorder is defined more by what it cannot do than what it can do. It is well built physically, although it is definitely designed for small hands, and can be a bit uncomfortable to use if your hands aren't small.\n\nIf all you want is to record medium quality voice, this will work fine. Don't expect it to record music or anything like that - you will be disappointed. Think of it as the audio version of a $20 digital camera. Cheap, quick, grabs the image, but no frills at all. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. \n\nI am usually very happy with Olympus gear, but this is definitely below their usual standard. Unless your needs are very spartan and smple, I would recommend looking at more capable devices\n"

aS'\tPoor Design Award Winner\n\t1.  Buttons are too small, some of which are not spaced apart very well (very convenient for somebody waking up who can accidentally hit the wrong button).\n\n2.  Buttons are labeled, organized, and layed out confusingly.  For example, why not have an "alarm interface" which would include all of the alarm modes and features, and maybe a "radio interface" which would include all of the radio functions/settings.  You would really understand how confusing this is if you were to actually go through the process of operating this alarm clock.  But really, don\'t do it, make the smart choice.\n\n3.  Too many features/modes.  I understand some people prefer all of the different features, but I wanted a simple alarm clock with a buzzer/radio, and clock.  Of course all of these special modes are set as the default, so it is a pain to try and configure all of the settings to a simple mode.  So for those who want a simple alarm clock, definitely DO NOT GET THIS!!\n\n4.  The button handling event is flawed.  For example, sometimes when I push a button, it does not handle the event (the device doesn\'t think that you pressed the button).  So I would have to press the button again and check to see if the radio handled the button input correctly.\n\n5.  It is very slow when holding the button down and waiting for the alarm clock to increment up and down.\n\n6.  Radio reception is very poor.  I have another radio right next to it that gets much better reception than this clock.\n\n7.  LED is not very bright and hard to read from 10 feet and farther out.\n\nI have nothing against TIMEX (they make great watches).  This was written to protect anyone who who does not want to waste $30.\n'

aS"\tIf you are going to use Coaxial cable protection, don't buy this one\n\tI bought this one for its coaxial cable protection function, but the result is terrible. It greatly degrades the signal. When I use it with TV, the program on TV became unclear. When I use it with computer, the high-speed internet kept dropping. \n\nI intended to return it to Amazon, and I found Amazon's return policy is that only partial refund for opened products. How can I know it's dysfunctional before I destroyed the package and used it? In the future, I only buy stuff at online stores with local stores, such as bestbuy or circuit city, so that I can easily get refund.\n"

aS"\tPretty Dissappointing\n\tI bought the iriver mobile transmitter hoping that i would be able to listen to my mp3 player through my radio. I like the fact that it is easy to use and that you can choose your station, but i live in monroe and we get stations from toledo and detroit, which is a problem because most or all of the stations are occupied or have interference and the transmitter is not strong enough to block out the slight interference from far away stations. I didnt think to check to see how many stations i could use for this product, looking back, i should have. i would only recommend this transmitter if you live somewhere that there aren't many stations that you can listen to on the radi\n"

I feel like I\'ve been ripped off, because they either didn\'t even look at it or they don\'t know how to test something for a problem.  I spent $300 for a detector that doesn\'t work as well as a $40 one (and I know, I\'ve had both)!\n\nI would say I recommend Escort, but I\'ve since learned that they are owned by the same company as Bel.  Valentine 1 is too costly, so I guess that doesn\'t really leave many good detectors on the market\n'

aS'\tbuy a Pocket PC smartphone instead\n\tAfter waiting almost 6 months for this Skypephone, and its competitor from Belkin, to come to market through numerous postponements, I just gave up and bought an Asus P525 smartphone. For just over double the price of the Netgear I got a Windows CE PDA with GSM capability and full Skype compatibility. When browsing through your phone contacts your are given the choice to call through GSM or Skype. Because you have built-in Wi-Fi, you can make Skype calls and chats from any covered area, plus you can go on the internet using IE and check your e-mails with Outlook. I have also read that the Skype software that runs on dedicated phones like the Netgear and the Belkin is very crude due to the lack of processing power, whereas with a Windows CE-based device you have much faster processors that allow a Skype software closer to the one used on PCs.\nFor those of you alergic to Windows, just wait for the Skype for Symbian release and buy a Nokia or SonyEricsson smartphone.\nBottom line: Skype is too good an application to be wasted on poorly designed hardware\n'

I can't see me using this laser pointer in a real presentation, since it'd either be on all the time, or I'd be pulling the light in and out all the time (neither of which make me look cool).\n\nSo if you're going to buy this, keep this limitation in mind\n"

aS'\tI HATE IT\n\tI hate this contraption and I stupidly let 30 days pass before I realized how much I hate it. Now I start every morning with a "boy I hate this thing."  Why? well here are few reasons why: You cannot read the numbers unless you are within 18" and to get a backlight you must depress "any button"---not a bad idea but horribly executed.  The backlight lasts four seconds--way too fast in the night and "any button" is a lie because you can\'t press "stop" nor the "on" for radio or cd without starting a whole other process which you then, in the dark, have to figure out how to terminate.  The cd player spends more time "reading" your cd than it does playing it.  The "tuner/band" button is very sensitive and lord knows what you will wake up to, the screech of a not tuned in AM station happens way too often.  The worst of it all was I called Eton to tell them how much I hated it, just thought they might want to know. I had a friendly conversation with a very nice receptionist who assured me they wanted me to be happy and would do something, but first she wanted me to talk to the engineer/designer.  So I waited a week for him to return my call and he was quite rude saying if there is nothing wrong with it (everything is wrong, but they don\'t count that) there is nothing they can do.  He offered to trade mine for a different one just the same and I said "why bother."  It was a classic story of "I made it so it is by definition without errors--now leave me alone,just buy it and be thrilled with my brilliant design\n'

Since it was only $20, I just left it alone. Well...after going months without a gamepad, I decided to get another Logitech gamepad, the same one I had, and guess what.

aS"\tNeed a bit more longevity\n\tI originally purchased the unit during the winter because of a sale, but I didn't install it until the beginning of July for our cross country trip from Oregon to Wash. DC. During the trip, there was quite a bit of interuption from hillsides and tall trees in the Pacific Northwest. I kind of wondered how well the reception would work in the city. Once I got out of the NW, I had no problems picking up a signal unless I was in a long tunnel or deep valley. \nI did notice the unit did get hot during the trip and I think that is why it is acting the way it is now (two months later). \n\nIt works fine when first turned on, but after 15 minutes, the signal flutuates and at times, no signal is received. The tech support said that I needed to check the wires, but since it is 'recently' installed and it doesn't happen when first turned on, I'm ruling it a receiver problem.\n\nThe unit is placed just below the radio head and has been exposed to direct sunlight when parked. I'm sure it didn't help.\n\nI'm currently looking for a better unit and XM said they would transfer the remainder of the account to the new radio without inducing an activation charge.\n"

aS'\tImpossibly difficult to use\n\tI ordered this unit with high expectations, lots of memory, expandable, multiple modes, from a well known company and an excellent price; how could I go wrong?.  Easily enough, as it turns out.  \n\nI was unable to load it and control the play lists.  Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop.\n\nDragging a folder to the device was pointless.  Most of the time the files didn\'t even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place.  I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from "My Computer" on the host system.  After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out. \n\nI have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method. \n\nThis was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb.  Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!. \n\nUsing Media Player to sync did no better.  Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop.  A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on.  \n\nAfter spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit.  The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job.\n\nThis is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it\'s hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons.  \n\nThroughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it.  I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well.  As it stands, it\'s without merit as a player.\n'

The big problem for me was the time it took to  change channels. A full 3 seconds. Went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs. Well I took it back and went to Walmart and got a Sanyo HT27546 for $270. Good set with quick channel change. It also has an optical digital outputwhich the Toshiba did not. The Sanyo also has a full one year warrenty. Sound on both TVs is fine. A small point.

aS"\tHave an iBook? Don't buy this lock!\n\tI posted a review two weeks ago, but it hasn't appeared, so I'm trying again...I bought this lock two years ago.  It has always been difficult to remove.  (Note:  despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.)  Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus\n"

aS"\tNot suitable for use in a moving vehicle\n\tIt's partly my fault, of course. I bought this to use on my motorcycle. I thought the small size, especially the flat body, would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag. I also bought a special handlebar mount for it. Unfortunately, I've had nothing but trouble with it. It's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes. Whether you're driving a car or a motorcycle, it's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route. Maybe it was intended for pedestrians only. The user interface for the GPS is not intuitive (at least, not for me), Worse still, it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes. The Garmin helpline in the UK could only tell me to reset the machine each time. Not very helpful. My guess is that the combination of palm PC and GPS was too much for Garmin to handle. They should probably just stick to GPS.\n"

aS'\tRMA issued\n\tThe mouse worked well with my chipset, but beaware that earlier bluetooth chipsets do not have the power to work with this mouse, although the dongle that is bundled with this is excellent.\nThe mouse was very difficult to use and unresponsive at times, requiring multiple clicks to choose items.  It was sluggish across the screen and very insensitive, even after maxing out all the mouse settings in either direction.  \nLooking through the forums at Anycom informed me that many people had a similar problem and RMA\'s were being issued.  Considering that these problems arose earlier last year, I was upset that I was sold a defective product. I just send my mouse back to Newport, California for a replacement. \nThe features are solid, the size is acceptable but prone to cramping at first.  For a travel mouse it is exceptional, being rechargeable via USB.  Usuage with the USB cable attatched is OK but somewhat awkward as the cable comes from the "head" of the mouse, not the "tail."\nWould I buy again? only if I didn\'t find another product that was rechargeable, bluetooth and optical.\n'

It turns out that this mouse has the same click scroll as many others.  It jerks one line at a time ... the clicking is quite loud I might add.  Also, I have to set the tracking speed very low because the cursor jerks all over the screen if I don't.  Sometimes just clicking on System Preferences corrects the problem, but if I had it to do over, I'd buy something else\n"

Yes, they are comfortable, but the bass is almost absent, no matter how far you jam them into your ears, the bass isn't nearly what it were hyped to be, it definently isn't enough for the amount of mid  and  hi's they produce. Unless you like your bass to a minimum and treble to a max, I'd recommend another pair of earphones. If you're just looking for comfort and you don't like hardly any bass, these are your headphones. But, as others said, you can find much better earphones for a much lower price\n"

aS'\tfleecing loyal apple buyers\n\tThe first thing I did when opening this item was check to make sure it actually WAS an Apple product.  Its REALLY cheap looking.  Looks like something you\'d find for [...] at a flea market or in the "stocking stuffers" section of the dollar store at Christmas time. The Nano is small so almost anything will hold it, including a rubber band and an envelope which is about as good as this unit.\n\nThis looks more like the freebie armband that should come free with the unit. Certainly not a [...] accessory. It just cheapens the Apple image.\n\nIf OEM Apple products are your thing, then go ahead and try this. But if you\'re looking for something as sweet as your nano that stays put while you workout, look for something else.  I\'m returning mine this weekend to spend my money elsewhere.\n'

aS"\tExtremely poor software package that makes it very disappointing\n\tI had a very poor experience with the Microsoft Media Center infrared keyboard and I wanted to replace it with a bluetooth solution that would - I thought - get rid of all connection problems.\n\nI was wrong. The hardware is very nice but the software keeps on dropping connections. \n\nAS usual, I was very careful: I always read manuals and properly install the software before using any product - I don't want to fail the installation for a very simple reason: the package doesn't come cheap... I am a software developer - I have half a dozen computers at home - and I did everything as instructed. I found the software to be very average in terms of usability (why do they try to do all these fancy effects??), but that's not very important when it works fine. \n\nUnfortunately, after just a couple of days, the keyboard stopped working. I finally managed to get it back by removing the batteries and rebooting the computer (both step were required - the on/off switch didn't work - same thing for the connect button which is totally ineffective). Now, the mouse keeps on dropping connections. After a couple of hours of inactivity, the mouse simply stops responding.\n\nThis is simply unacceptable. Logitech knows that this product doesn't work and keeps on charging customers for something that is simply not usable because it wasn't tested properly.\n\nIt is a very frustrating experience because the hardware is great. Don't buy this product, you could be very disappointed.\n\nNote that I have seen another installation done by professional Windows system administrators that had the exact same problems.\n\nNow don't get me wrong: the hardware is very nice. I would highly recommend the Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks \nwhich is great and had none of the issues I have mentioned there\n"

aS'\tNo INSERT or ESCAPE keys!!!\n\tThe keyboard and mouse work fine, except for some completely absurd reason, Logitech decided to remove the INSERT and ESCAPE keys from the regular keyboard and make them little buttons on the top of the keyboard instead. Look at the picture and you will see what I mean -- the DELETE key is double-size and takes up the space where the insert key would be; INSERT is moved above the home key and is a little recessed round button.  ESCAPE is in the usual place, but it too is a little button instead of a legitimate key.  Very annoying.  Definately returning it\n'

aS'\tIf I knew then what I know now... I\'d still buy it.\n\tSo, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn\'t work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn\'t find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn\'t matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It\'s not a night-and-day difference, but it\'s a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. \nThis product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it\'s control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I\'ll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \n\nMy recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it\'s not an option and you don\'t want to put the money into an "ipod to car" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio.\n'

aS"\tGood performance for $150; but cheaply made (in China).\n\tI've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).\n\nPLUSES: \ndecent sound\ngood functionality\neasy set-up and intuitive operation\nsimple remote -- but only covers basic functions\n\nCONS:\nvery short speaker leads\nunattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox\nonly holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units\n\nAt first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.\n\nI originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality\n"

aS'\tWorks Great, Poor/Inaccurate Documentation\n\t(Note to Brian: The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.)\n\nMajor modes of operation are:\n\n1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up)\n2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device)\n3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage)\n4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a "virtual" cable; you need two to get the job done)\n\nA pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian\'s comment that this wouldn\'t work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work.\n\nI rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons.\n\n1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment!\n2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is "admin". Well, it\'s not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.\n3. Something that 99% of the world won\'t care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it\'s attached to.

aS"\tBest headphone value EVER\n\tThese headphones are lightweight, fairly comfortable, and sound head and shoulders better than any pair of $20 headphones I've ever heard.  Here are the aspects people always want to know about:\n\nBASS: these don't pound your eardrums in, but the bass that is there is infinitely cleaner and snappier than some of those boomy headphones I've heard.  You can really follow the bass line with these, rather than just having your eyeballs fuzz out from vibration.\n\nMIDS/HIGHS: this is the reason to buy these headphones.  Not too bright, but very clear, warm, smooth, soothing, and musical.  The first time I listened to music on these I was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string, something I'd never heard before on that song.  In fact, I blame these headphones on my new addiction to, well, headphones.\n\nThese obviously can't play as loudly as $200 headphones, and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach, but everything in the middle is VERY good.  I don't think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under $100.  And being under $20, you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money.  I should go work for these guys or something =)\n"

Then you drive around wondering if your $700 Nuvi is going to fall and break.  Not Fun!  The friction mount works for me. For everyday driving, even aggresive driving, it stays put.  Someone on this site left feedback about using it with their Nuvi 360 and I used their review to make the purchase.  I'm glad I did.\n"

aS"\tGreat size, great price, great performance...\n\tI am a success coach and I record all my coaching calls as a standard practice. This recorder has performed fantastically in all situations. I get about 9 - 12 continuous hours of battery operation (depending on battery quality) and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls (I have an adapter for the phone). I have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results. I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries (always have one extra on hand) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time. Recharge before your event each day and you won't miss a thing. The unit only uses one battery and it's always a great idea to have a spare. The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire, so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings. Each stop and restart begins a new file. For me that works great! If you are looking for one continuous file, do not shut it off. You can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use. You would be hard pressed to find a better product for the money\n"

aS'\tupdated from a 17" CRT and wanted something to match iMac 20"\n\twhen I bought my Intel iMac w/20" LCD suddenly everything else looked dull in comparison. This Apple 20" is very close in spec to my iMac 20" screen. Stores like Best Buy do not have good quality 20+" LCDs in yet. You want the 16x9 profile also, the regular square LCDs look dorky in comparison and typically have lower brightness and contrast ratios. The newer stuff is very bright and clear. It is obvious when you go to a store and look at the LCD screens. The cheap $200 LCDs just don\'t look good in comparison to the new stuff.\n\nIntel iMac screen:\n1680x1050\n280 cd/m2 (brightness in candle power)\n800:1 Contrast ratio\n\nApple 20" LCD\n1680x1050\n250 cd/m2  \n400:1 Contrast\n14ms response time (www.apple.com/displays/specs.html)\n\nOther comparables:\nGateway 21" 1680x1050 $599\n300 cd/m2  1000:1 contrast\n\nDell 24" 2405FPW $800\n1920 x 1200\n500 cd/m2\n1000:1 contrast\n\nYou should be aiming for at least 300 cd/m2 on brightness and close to 1000:1 contrast.  These Apple LCDs have been out for awhile and are starting to show their age in comparison to the brand new products that have just started to come out. If you are using your LCD for a TV you may need the brightness, but for computer work the Mac 20" LCD is just about right. \n\nI paid a few $$$ more ($750 total price) for the Apple LCD, but I feel I made the correct purchase. I just didn\'t like the way the others looked and it had to look good against my iMac. I actually like this screen better than the one on my iMac and it seems just as bright even if the specs say that it is not. Amazon also boxes the shipment (besides the Apple box) so your screen should arrive undamaged\n'

aS"\tBest in class\n\tThese are the best portable headphones in this price range.  Good bass and smooth, natural sound. In fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price.  If you can afford more, consider the Sennheiser PX100 for about 40-50 dollars. But if you're on a budget or don't want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones, these are definitely the ones to get\n"

aS"\tGreat Receiver\n\tI purchased this receiver from Fry's Electronics in San Diego, CA for $199.99. At first, I was a little hesitant about purchasing an all digital receiver. When I got it home, and connected it, I was amazed. This receiver will blow you away with the precision of it's home theater capabilities. I am using four Polk R30's as my fronts, and rear surround, and two Sony center channels for my front center, and rear center channels. I also have a KLH 10inch Tremor Series powered subwoofer. I estimate the entire system to cost about $650.00 total. I have colleague that has a Bose home theater system, and my little system blows his out of the water, and he paid much more for the Bose. If you want a great receiver a minimal price, this is the way to go. By the way, did I mention that it has four digital inputs, an optical output, and HDMI in and out connections. BUY IT!!!\n"

aS"\tExcellent Value for money\n\tI did a lot of research and finally ended up with this product. \n\n1) BOSE is an excellent piece - but main drawbacks - portability and lack of audio input from other devices\n\n2) Altec Lansing - basically a roun cylinder shaped one and I didnt get that in a black color for my 30 GB Black Video Ipod and the sound wasnt that impressive as Bose (or for that matter Logitech mm 50)\n\n3) Apple's ipod Dock - its a bulky one, that is definitely not portable and costlier than the Bose. \n\nI went to BestBuy to listen to everything and Logitech mm 50 really outweighs the other ones on these - price, portability and sound quality, yea, its not like Bose or Apple's dock - but really good for such a small piece. \n\nThe only thing I find a little difficult is, I am not able to switch playlists with the remote, its just for play/pause/next/prev and sounds, would've been completely happy if had all that I could do in the ipod.

I do have a Mac and she doesn't have any issue calling me from her pc.  We use Aol instant messenger (Video and Audio) or Yahoo Messenger (Video) to connect.  I still prefer the iSight for Macs.

aS"\tExcellent sound for those willing to take a risk\n\tEchoing most other reviews here, this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk! If you don't wear these earphones correctly, they sound terrible, easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.  Those unsatisfied with the sound quality (especially those complaining of lack of bass) either haven't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears.\n\nLearning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips: Before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\n\nIt may seem like it takes a lot of work (and possibly learning a bit about anatomy) to get these earphones to work as intended.  It does, and success is not guaranteed.  But it's worth it! And to save your hearing, don't forget to turn down the volume, since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise\n"

aS'\tImpressive\n\tThis is a great little piece of hardware. \n\nI bought it for my MP3\'s and movies, and I\'m very pleased. It\'s totally "plug-n-play"; there aren\'t even any drivers that need updating, assuming you have XP up to par. \n\nIt gives 160GB (well, 149 in actuality) of space to work with. After moving nearly 50 gigs over to it at once, on the first day, it froze up. After that minor incident, I\'ve had no problems, though, and my machine runs alot faster because of it. With my 100G of music already on it, I\'m very happy with it. It has given me no fuss--it doesn\'t even give me any noise! It\'s as silent as a fart, and that\'s a big plus.\n\nI found mine at Wal-Mart for $114 and I think that I made a good purchase. If you\'re on a budget, this is about as good as it gets. Seagate\'s 300GB is also highly recommended, as I\'ve worked with it before. A+\n'

aS"\tGreat for a small radio\n\tI purchased this radio to keep on my kitchen counter.  I chose Boston Acoustics over Tivoli because you can't preset the stations in the Tivoli and I like to flip through commercials. Other reviewers wrote that the bass can be overpowering.  I listen to rock music and do not notice the bass. My complaint is that this radio advertises itself as picking up weak stations very clearly.  It does not pick up stations much better then the other radios in my house.  Also if you are listening to the radio you can't see the time display.\n\nThis radio is great if you have limited space.  It looks good and sounds like a much larger radio. It has a lot of power for a small radio.\n"

aS'\tBeware if you run XP\n\tNetgear clearly has not figured out how to make their RangeMax adapter work well with the Microsoft XP operating system.  If you\'re not a techie, I\'d stay away until Microsoft has certified the WPN311. Here\'s what I experienced:\n\n1. Installed using the Netgear WPN311 automated configuration.\n2. After installation completion and boot up, CPU utilization was at a solid 100%.  Executable from Netgear named WLANCFG5.EXE taking up a bunch of the CPU and Microsoft routines CSRSS.EXE, NET.EXE, and NET1.EXE taking the rest.\n3. Emailed Netgear and received response to use Task Manager to delete WLANCFG5.EXE.  Did so for all users.\n4. Hey!  CPU utilization returned to normal!\n5. Sent next email to Netgear pointing out that this solution is just a "patch" and WLANCFG5 would return when I re-booted.\n6. Received response to de-install and re-install software for WPN311.\n7. Did so, but then Netgear adapter software could not find my MIMO wireless router!  And usage of the Netgear adapter software doesn\'t allow you to use the Microsoft Wireless Zero Configurator (WZC).\n8. Went to microsoft.com and looked up error 871122 "Error message when you try to run the Wireless Network Setup Wizard" and followed the instruction to allow usage of WZC.\n9.

aS"\tFaint high-pitched tone\n\tI'm using the Monster Cable MP Home Theater PowerCenter HTS800 to remove line noise in the electrical current to a high-end tube pre-amp.

aS'\tPeople need to understand...\n\tAll in-ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something.  Sound travels along wires... it\'s physics, there\'s nothing you can do about that.  Now, these earphones are incredibly light-weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  \n\nThese headphones are called "asymmetric," meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn\'t spill on the wire.\n\nI paid about 60 bucks and for that price, I love these headphones.  Face it, these are low to mid-range in terms of price, but perform more like mid-range to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.  I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair\n'

aS"\tHub Printable!!\n\tThese Verbatims are terrific.  As you may know, working with DVD-R media is almost a gamble...cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players.  Sticking to name brands helps, but even then, some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot/batch may be good, the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else.  Usually, you're safe with media made in Japan.  These Verbatim's are made in Taiwan but, they are great..I've bought one every couple months and I'm on my 3rd spindle now.\n\nThey have a wonderful printing surface that as mentioned, dries nearly instantly in Epson printers (I use an R200).  Hub printable so you can print all the way to the edge which gives your discs a terrific look when printing nice disc art or photos.  Not one coaster so far, burned with Apple Powerbook 2X Superdrive as well as a Lacie D2 Firewire writer. Though the media is 8X, it works in my Panasonic DVD Recorder (DMR-E55) which recommends up to 4X media perfectly).  So far, I have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs (Samsung, Sanyo, Panasonic, Sony, Apex, Toshiba DVD Players, PS2, XBox, no problems) .  Over 134 discs so far, and they look great, play great, and are a great price for hub printable discs.   Highly recommended...I'm ordering more!\n"

Also, it works on some computers, too!\n\nOn the minus side, I haven't gotten it to work on the television.  In order to do so, you also have to buy the adapter for the Creative Zen player.\n\nI bought this so my Creative Sleek Photo would be compatible with an X-Rocker chair with built in speakers, and found that CD players and many other audio units became compatible, too.

aS'\tgood, could be easily improved\n\tI am running the RadioShark on a G4 PowerBook w/ Mac OS X 10.4.  I am very happy with the programmed recording - saves to a variety of formats, etc. Very handy! The unit did all that it promised, but it could have had much better software. A Dashboard Widget is also included that controls basic operation, but not recording or EQ.\n\nNeeded additions:\n1. Station presets are selected from a drop down menu??!? One has to go to the RS menu bar (top of screen) to find the favorite Stations - kind of klunky. Better to have "radio buttons" associated with the App window. To be fair, the Widget does have better station selection, but the button is labeled with a \'heart\'...\n2. No station "scan" function. One has to dink through the entire spectrum manually - wow - hard to understand this lack of functionality.\n3. Some additional audio filter/edit functions could be included. There is a multi-band EQ that works well, mostly (see comment below). At minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect. Also, one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file. Though, for Mac OS X there is a nice freeware app that can do this:  AUDACITY.\n\nOddities\n1. When first installed, the output had static in it which was worse with the EQ on. Griffin Tech Support was not very helpful - as with most tech support offerings, they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions. Re-installed software and it began working well.\n2. Initially did not seem to work well thru an external (powered) hub; now has no problems. Though, unit does work okay with a USB extension cable\n'

aS'\tAs sturdy as it looks, and with very good sound for the price\n\tI bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They\'ve both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn\'t affected by it so I don\'t consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it "should," but likewise, it\'s something to be expected with this much use and hasn\'t affected comfort.\n\nThe cable is also thicker than most headphone cables I\'m used to, which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such.\n\nI\'ve compared the sound quality to the Koss QZ-50\'s (which I own) and a library\'s Koss UR-10\'s or 15\'s (can\'t remember which).  Though the QZ-50\'s do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on, the UR-20\'s are the most comfortable of the three, have the richest bass, are the most durable, and won\'t eat up your AAA batteries like the QZ-50\'s\n'

aS"\tGood Phone System, for the Price\n\tThis Uniden phone/answering system has been trouble free since we bought it three months ago.  Here's a list of the other things about this phone that I like most:\n1.  The corded handset base unit can be used to make and receive calls even when the electricity is off.  This, along with price, was the main reason I bought this phone system.  This feature is unusual for a cordless phone system.\n2.  The controls on the answering machine are simple and intuitive enough so that you don't have to refer to the manual when you need to set the clock or change the outgoing recording.\n3.  Also, the answering machine has operated flawlessly so far.\n4.  The battery life of the cordless handset has been excellent between charges.  At least a week, sometimes more.\n5.  Voice quality of the cordless handset and the corded base handset are very good.\n\nHowever, there is something about this phone system that I don't like.\n--The cordless handset has a pretty limited range.  I had to locate the base unit in a central location in my 2,300 square foot house to get the handset to work in all rooms.\n\nBut overall I think the phone is a good buy, if you can live with the distance restrictions of the cordless handset\n"

aS'\tExcellent value for the price\n\tVery effective inside a plane comparing to the other noise cancelling headphone I have. Sound is ok for what it does. However, in a moving vehicle, it actually distorts the music which is a surprise. My other noise-cancelling headphone does not do that. It appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite noise-cancelling wave. By the time the opposite wave applies to the music, the intruding noise is over. Otherwise, no complains\n'

aS"\tSatisfied\n\tI have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system, this MUST be taken into account.    \n\nFirst off, this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \n \nWhat brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \n\nOnce I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \n\nSince I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \n\nMy test soundtracks included:  Gladiator, Matrix (II or III), Snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \n\nAll in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.\n\nGood:  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy set-up.  Well built speakers-aesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.\n\nBad:  Subwoofer awkward, no dedicated center channel, pricey, no included receiver.\n\nFor their size these speakers more than compete with any full-blown tower 5.1 system.  Here is one satisfied customer\n"

aS'\tThanks for the memories\n\tI am a camcorder buff. Ever since my children were born, I have \nhad the camcorder attached to my hand most days because I know\nthat life is fleeting and memories are too precious to be lost.\n\nI had a huge collection of video tapes and was able to transfer\nthe entire collection to DVD. Now I know that they will last at\nleast through my life time.. Also, I find that using the Showbiz\napplication, I can create customized DVDs for my friends and\nthat has saved me a ton of money in gifts..\n\nThe only problem we had with this product was that we had\nlimited hard disk memory and had to acquire some more. \nAnd I have probably created more than a 100 DVDs by now.\n\nThanks HP!\n'

aS'\tMonster Cable S-Video MVS3-1M\n\tNoel Lee\'s Monster Cable products Inc., come up with the goods here! A cable of stunning, high resolution that snaps the picture into such clarity that you\'ll think you\'re watching scenes through a glass window and not through a television/monitor, a bold claim indeed, BUT, quite true never-the-less. I was totally unprepared for such a dramatic change for the better. This cable brings to the viewer ALL the picture, and, yes, that does mean "Warts and all"so, be prepared to see the smallest of detail, like strings and wire that enabled special effects crews to do their work "Un-seen". Who really needs HDTV when cables like Monster\'s MVS3-1M are this good and can bring a vastly superior standard to an existing television/monitor for only a minute fraction of the cost. Thanks Noel, well done\n'

aS"\tThe Best!!!\n\tI've owned these Altec's for over three years now, and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them - as a matter of fact, when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer, I went ahead and still purchased these babies!\n\nSOUND QUALITY --- the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall - I have used mine for video editing, and I'm very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through, in addition to the special effects sound - unless you need a five speaker system (or comparable) then I'm confident that this is the most crisp sound you'll find in any speaker\n\nVOLUME --- these suckers can get LOUD - just take my word for it\n\nCOMPATIBILITY --- This is the part I love most - there is no software to install and no special plugs - the speakers plug right in, and very easily, into the audio jack, just like a pair of headphones would --- thus, hooking in a computer, iPod, cd-player, etc, is easy as heck, making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment\n\nCONTROLS --- the speaker system comes with a seperate remote, giving one access to adjust the volume, bass, and treble, all seperately from the computer's controls -- the knob to control the volume, and other functions, is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments\n\nSIZE --- the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size -- placing these speakers is easy\n\nPRICE --- believe me - it's a bargain at under $200!!!\n\nOverall, I give my full recommendation here -- you'll love these speakers\n"

aS'\tUpgraded to solve security  issue.\n\tI decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g.  I did this because the "g" card would randomly disconnect when the WEP or WPA security was activated.  Living in a home near about 6 other networks I really wanted the router and wireless network secured.  So, I purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem.  I can happily say it solved the random disconnect with WPA security turned on.  The range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid.  Have not had a disconnect yet, over the last 5 hours.\n\nThe reason I took away one star is the fact on the Wireless Network Monitor V2.1 there seems to be a flaw.  When I connect to the network and internet the monitor says it is hooked to the network but unable to find the internet.  Obvious by my submission of this review, the internet can be found and used.\n\nAll in all a good product that functions just fine in my A45-S121 Toshiba laptop.\n\nPhil (Mesa, AZ\n'

aS'\tVery good standard SD card at an excellent price!\n\tI recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!\n'

aS"\tWorks Great with Macintosh\n\tI set up a small security program with my Macintosh. Intially I needed a PC to place the settings in the camera, however once I got it hooked up to my security system it works beautifully. I would recommend you leave the lights on though because if you don't you will be getting just a black, fuzzy dark image back if you are using this camera for security. This camera is a very simple easy to use camera without the fuss of zooming, pan, tilt etc. If you need a simple camera you can't go wrong with the D-link DCS-900 (Wireless or wired version)\n"

aS'\tIt really works\n\tI found this as the perfect solution to fill in some dead airt space in my house downstairs given the internet connection is upstairs and so far, other wireless solutions have been marginal. I really wondered if the Ethernet over powerlines would really work or if the 802.11G would really work. \n\nSo I get my new Extender kit, unbox it and plug everything in without bothering to read the directions. Lets be real, this stuff SHOULD be plug and play and IT WAS. It came right up and worked and has worked for the past three months flawlessly. I have decent range downstairs, it works with the Macs and the PCs and doesnt seem to care a whit. I can highly recommend using this product as the primary connection or as I did, extending an existing network without having to pull cable or put in multiple 802.11 bridges\n'

aS"\tA little expensive but worth the money\n\tWhen I purchased this product a couple weeks ago I wanted to make sure this purchase was worthwhile.  I studied many other speaker stands and it just didn't seem I would have been getting the same quality. \n\nI received this pair a few days ago and originally thought they may be a little complicated to put together.  They only took about twenty minutes to assemble and put my cube speakers on.  The stands look great and go well with the cube speakers.

Satellite aquisition under the trees did not happen the few times I tried.  The display is excellent under sunny conditions.  Downloading waypoint data into a text file was simple.  I haven't used it yet under driving conditions, so I can't speak to using related features.  Were it damaged or stolen, I'd buy another one without hesitation\n"

aS'\tPersonal Productivity Tool\n\tThe HP12C has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years. I bought my first one when I was a consultant and it lasted until August 2006. It withstood all the travel and constant use well.

aS'\tA must for Home Theater or Multimedia centers.\n\tI was really pushing the limits of my mid-range Monster surge protector with 2 TVs, a 2.4Gig P4 with desktop TV, DSL, two printers, and .....drumroll please.....a fridge all crammmed into a  corner office setup about 7\' wide. The Belkin Gold unit with RF/EMI suppression up to 75db cured all the rattle and hum problems with speakers, satellite signal, the "dirty" line into my modem, and a week later I haven\'t had to reboot my system once. Amazing!\n\nI had already had a great experience with a Belkin SurgeMaster on my Home Theater setup, so I went one level up with this "Gold" unit. One of the better investments I\'ve made lately. I paid $60 at the local Office Depot, the price Amazon is advertising is ridiculously low at $35. Belkin.com\'s price is about $70 so my advice is to buy this unit now before somebody at Amazon wakes up  and jacks the price.\n'

aS"\tGreat\n\tI was looking for something suitable to house my sansa, and this fit the bill better than most. The leather case is superb, looking sharp, snug and protective. I enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it. Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back, if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it. The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth, great for cleaning. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles, still haven't figured out how yet, and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing. But, really, if you invest in a product such as this, it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen! The larger case is compact and protective, having a small storage area, yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap, generic looking Sansa logo. Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt, but not as a removable type. Only if you put it on when putting on the belt, which can be impractical in some circumstances. This way, I suppose, it wouldn't be able to fall off\n"

aS'\tIncredible Sound, Unbeatable Value\n\tOnce THE speaker of choice for every hard rockin\' audiophile with a big enough garage, Klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that didn\'t know the real value of what they\'d bought.  But after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles, Klipsch is back on top, from a sound quality standpoint -- and it shows in the ProMedia 2.1 THX.\n\nI have my trio connected to a new Mac Pro desktop unit and the sound is absolutely magical.  Yes, there are more complex set-ups, with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room, but if you just want the magic without the madness, the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX is an incredible (and very affordable) solution that\'s quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes.\n\nOf course, there are other 3-speaker desktop systems by makers like Logitech, Cyber Acoustics, and Intec, but here\'s the difference: Klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer, while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers.  NOT the same thing.  The only brands that are true competitors to Klipsch in this area are Bose, Harman Kardon, JBL, and Altec Lansing.  I find that the Altec Lansing and JBL 3-speaker sets both sound nasal and "tinny" on the high end, while the Bose and Harman Kardon sets sound great, but are more expensive.  So, after a good look (and listen) around, I went with Klipsch.\n\nIn any case, this is an incredible sound set-up for your computer-based music player and should not be overlooked.  Enjoy\n'

aS'\tFantastic Splitter\n\tThis splitter was set-up as part of a configuration that splits one line from the street into three and then into sixteen ports and a line to the cable modem for a fraternity house. I used this brand of splitters and a moterola amplifier all the way through, and the results were amazing. The picture quality is crystal clear, even when almost all of the ports are in use, and the internet is blazing fast. Compared to the set-up we used to have, with some cheap splitters and a radio shack amplifier, these pieces are WELL WORTH THE SMALL EXTRA COST\n'

aS'\tPowerful for the price\n\tUntil an accident caused one bud to stop emitting sound, these were my favorite pair of earphones. They were comfortable (I often left them in when I went to sleep), affordable, lightweight, durable, and had good sound quality. I used them with my Sony CFD-V5 boombox, my Oritron OP5034 portable CD player, and my RCA RP2410 MP3-CD player. On all three, bass and detail was great, and there was no distortion at a higher volume. All in all, these earphones were a great value; the only possible downside is a bit of fuzziness in the sound, which I got used to rather quickly and began to prefer over my other earphones (it lent a bit of warmth to the music). I plan to buy another pair in the near future, and I highly recommend that you do so as well\n'

aS"\tGood product\n\tI love sound systems. So when I got my new reciever (Sony STR-DE898/B) I hooked up the new speaker wires with the THX Certified Gold Plated speaker connectors and wow what a difference. I miscalculated how much wire I needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire, I can hear a light and day difference in sound quality. Needless to say I'm ordering more to complete the job. The monster fiber optic cable is a must as well. I can hear sounds that I normally couldn't on my old system. I like testing sound with: The Hulk (the scene were he tears up the tanks), Saving Private Ryan (taking the beach), and Open Range (Gunfight at the end of the movie). In all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that I could not before the new wire and connectors. Excellent product\n"

aS"\tMore bang for your buck.\n\tThis is my first mp3 player so I researched it carefully before making my decision. The gorgeous screen, the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points. I'm so glad I bought it. Videos look great on the screen. Some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general I love it. The built in speaker doesn't do it justice. Even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing. Making playlists with the creative software is very easy. My biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it. No case, no screen protectors out for it. I'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do. But for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the Ipod or the Zune.\n"

As long as we restart the video call, then the sound comes back.  I am using Windows Live Messenger as the video call program.  I have never used the cartoons that it comes with.  The video quality is very good when recording a video for email\n"

aS'\tExcellent Product except cables came with it\n\tThis amplifier works as stated.  Increased my modem downstream from -7 to +9.  No obvious loss of noise ratio and upstream signals.

For minimum loss of broadband signals, I suggest you replace one of them with R6 cable to carry the cable signals.  Use the RG59 for the power supply only\n'

aS"\tUltra Convenient\n\tThe convenience of this product is terrific.  Whenever I show people how it snaps in half, they're amazed at the ingeniousness of it and they say how they want to get one.

aS"\tWorks well at a great price\n\tInstallation on a normal home network setup is very easy. My setup was a little more complex due to voip router, and 2nd wireless router. Sling has instructions on their web site but I still had to mess around with my settings in order to get it to work. To work on multiple routers you have to do port forwarding on both routers to port 5001. Once I worked this out everything is great. \n\nVideo quality is good in the house, haven't tried it from another location. I'm running the Sling AV with Netgear Ethernet power adaptors to my router and then watching TV via wireless to my laptop. Now we can watch TV in any room of the house. My wife loves being able to watch the news in the morning while in the kitchen. She also loves being able to surf while having a show running in a small window on the side. \n\nControl of my Dish DVR is very good. We can manage any feature of our Satelite/DVR box. This will come in handy when we travel as we have our sons Seaseme Street shows on the DVR and now we can take those with us on the road. \n\nOverall, I'm pleased with the Sling AV. It offers good performance at a great price point. Now Sling just needs to get the Mac version out so I can watch TV on my beautiful 15.4 inch Mac Book Pro\n"

aS'\tFantastic\n\tI bought this item about 4 months ago and do not have a single complaint.  I use it in Chicago.  A lot of reviews say it takes a long time to acquire a satellite signal, not true at all.  I think the longest I have ever waited was 20 seconds.  It does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes, when I am surrounded by tall buildings (Wacker Dr.)  But this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna.\nOverall, this GPS works perfectly.  The auto-reroute is fantastic, it is very quick to recalculate my route if I miss a turn, and the voice prompts give you plenty of warning in advance of a turn.

aS'\tGreat notebook case\n\tI purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for her \nHP Pavilion Notebook PC (DV5139US), screen size 15.4", ht 1.8", wdth 14.1", depth 10.4 ". The bag is for personal use, not business, and use will be moderate. She did want some extra compartments for organization. \n\nThis case has met all her needs, it is light weight, constructed of durable material, well organized. Her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease. She is satisfied with this purchase. We would recommend purchasing this case.\n'

aS'\t1 gig of Sony memory is NOT too much!! I have 2 for each camera!\n\tI have owned many Sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now. The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory, you run out when you need it most. That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig. Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go. \n\nLook, when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size (3-6 megapixels) per picture, which you should always do to get the best possible prints made, your camera will need a ton of storage space.  Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn\'t expected like a wildfire, a plane crash, a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens. You can always "resize" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space. Trust me, take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected.\n\nYou never know. I have tons of pictures that people ask how did I ever get such good pictures of such amazing things. I have a helicopter crash, police car up a power poll, deer in downtown Oakland, house fire before the Fire Dept got there, tons of wild animals, any many more things I saw while I was driving somewhere or walking in a park. If you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives!\n\nMatching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea. No problems ever!! The Sony memory sticks I have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems. They make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer. They are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable. I have first hand knowledge that products with the SONY name on it are first rate and high quality. If you want quality buy SONY\n'

aS"\teverything is labled for the game\n\tat first, the keyboard looked cheap and  the keys were in slightly different places than normal, but after time, I got used to the layout, and found that the keys actually work surprisingly smooth.  It probably helped my game a bit.  The extra bit on the front of the board did break off after 2 weeks, but I didn't like using it anyway\n"
p337
aS'\tI like it. I recommend it.\n\tThe things I like most:\n\n1. My recorded greetings (two greetings allowed) and my caller\'s messages are clear and clean. \n\n2. The unit\'s appearance and styling is sleek and modern. The controls layout is good with everything in view and accessible on the top. My last machine had some of its controls on the sides causing me to have to pick it up and turn it around and around looking for a particular control. This machine is better in that respect. \n\n3. Learning to use it is a very easy and intuitive process especially if you have used other machines. The included instructions clearly explain how to use its less obvious features.\n\nThings I didn\'t like: Nothing, really. \n\nBut some minor annoyances include:\n\n1. The electronic accent of the generated voice of the machine was a little hard to understand at first. But I quickly "learned" its accent. Your callers will never hear it after you record your own greeting which will be clear and sound like you. Otherwise, your callers will hear a default message in the machine\'s voice.\n\n2. I installed the 9 volt battery first and the unit would not turn on when plugged into AC. Removing the battery, then plugging in the AC, then installing the 9 volt battery allowed it to power up and work normally. The battery installation instructions and general installation instructions did not indicate any particular installation sequence requirements regarding the battery\n'

aS'\tDON\'T Upgrade the REB 1100!!\n\tJust a note to future readers - \nIf you take Gemstar up on their offer to "upgrade" this model you will receive some nice new features, however what they don\'t tell you is that your machine will become PROPRIETARY! All the books you had before will become unreadable and your ebook will only be able to "read" Gemstar books in the future. This means you are force to buy all future books from the Gemstar catalog only! \nThe new features that come with this upgrade to the 1150 model are hardly worth being locked into one ebook vendor forever. The openness of this little model is it\'s beauty - it\'s the last one of it\'s kind, as all future models are proprietary\n'

aS"\tVery pleased at the price and sound.\n\tI am pleased at the sound of these speakers.  I feel that for the price, it was a good purchase.  The carrying case that is included is a nice addition.  You can use the included A/C adapter or run it on batteries.  Not only do I use these speakers with my iPod, but also for my Mac Book laptop.  I don't need an overbearing sound, but these portable speakers are just right\n"

aS"\tWicked Good Back Pack\n\tA sore back and a sore shoulder forced me to search for a better means to carry my laptop.  I took a month to research laptop backpacks and finally settled on the Kensington Contour.  I didn't want to buy a Kensington.  I wanted a backpack making company with a name I knew, like Jansport,or Kelty.  I've been a backpacker and was familiar with their products.  I settled on the Kensington because it had the qualities I was seeking: comfort, quality materials and design, water proofing, laptop padding, urban black, rugged exterior, sophisticated appearance, lots of pockets, adjustable lumbar support with back padding and a water bottle pocket.  I write and work in media for a living.  Mostly I work at home, but once a week I travel to cities.  This pack does exactly what I want it to do - have places for everything I need, protect my precious laptop, and look hip.  \n\nSo now it is a few months later.  I still like my pack, but twice now the hardware has broken.  The first time it was just the zipper-handle on the little outside pocket. It fell off.  Kennisington immediately replaced the pack for free.  Last week at the airport the tab that holds and adjusts the left shoulder strap-- broke when slung the pack across my back. I haven't contacted them yet\n"

aS'\tGood Investment\n\tLet me just preface this review by mentioning that I read many customer reviews(here and elsewhere) on this product before purchasing it. I focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws. After using this keyboard for almost 6 months I believe that Saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality. \n\nCommand Pad: Many reviews bash this feature. It is quite a basic pad as compared to some, but it gets the job done. My only main gripe with the pad was how it failed to deliver some windows macros such as ctrl-alt-delete. During games such as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems whatsoever. The rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me. The customers who claimed it to be "impossible" and "buggy" seem to be computer illiterate at best, and judging from the frequency of grammatical errors in their reviews, possible English illiterate as well. If you are familiar with computer hardware then you will be fine with this software and pad.\n\nKeyboard: The quietness, response, and overall feel of the keys rival any Logitech design. I am a huge fan/customer of Logitech equipment, and thus can confidently state that this board is of equal material quality. Saitek took a more simple route with this design(no LCD screen etc...) and the price shows it.\n\n*I almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of key-symbol illumination. It is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased. Unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge. I would guess that 90% of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved. \n\nLast and probably least comes the aesthetics, of course the most subjective part of any review. I found this setup to be very sharp looking. In the dark, the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for. This eliminates the need for symbol illumination. Although symbol illumination might be a nice touch, especially for the keyboard deficient, I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering. I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I\'ve been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated). Saitek Engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination, apparently an oversight on their part. \n\nI will recap this lengthy review by recommending this keyboard to any capable computer enthusiast who desires a good value.\n'

aS'\tGood skin...good price.\n\tThis is a very good skin for 60 GB  and  80 GB owners.  It completely covers the entire iPod without sacrificing functionality.  What separates this skin from other skins it the Visor (a plastic shield which protects the screen).  My only problem with this skin is the belt clip.  It is impossible to remove and difficult to use.  A better belt clip would make this the perfect skin.  This is a very good price from TechGNet.\n'

aS"\tIt Does Exactly What I Needed\n\tI have a Gateway CX2610, and it always got hot in my lap after about 10 or 15 minutes.  Enter this Targus lapdesk.  When folded out, it provides a nice buffer between my lap and the heat of the laptop even when using the laptop for upwards of two hours.\n\nBut wait, there's more!  I had also found my laptop awkward to use at a desk because of the poor ergonomics.  However, I use this lapdesk folded with the adjustable leg to reposition the keyboard to a better angle for typing.  It also puts the screen at a better height as well.\n\nThe desk also works well folded in half with my laptop converted to tablet mode.  So, it's a very versatile accessory to go with my versatile laptop.  I highly recommend it\n"

aS'\tGood Overall Buy\n\tI recently purchased a PNY 512 MB Secure Digital Card from Best Buy when it was on sale for $29.99 each card. I had been given a SanDisk 256 mb card for christmas the past year, which had gone curropt. The PNY is so much better and so much cheaper for virtually the same quality or better than my old SanDisk. I would recommend this product to anybody who is fed up with SanDisk or any other high priced memory manufacturer.\n\nSteve\n'

aS"\tWorks just fine\n\tNo problems w/ the phone. There is no mute button and it's annoying to hit two buttons to mute/unmute.

p347
aS"\tGreat sound, not so great comfort.\n\tI agree with most of the reviews here.  The PC155 is a great headset overall.  The sound quality is great.  Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent.  I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed.  Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before!  It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs.  The controls are also simple to use, both on the cord and on the PC.\n\nAudio recording quality is great as well.  I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it.  Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side, however.  Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock.\n\nMy biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department.  I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones.  Usually, I wear high-quality buds.  So, perhaps I just have to get used to it.  However, I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones.  Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure, they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes.\n\nSo, despite my positive review of the sound quality, I am going to send these back and try the PC165.  They supposedly have bigger ear cups, which will hopefully translate to more comfort?  Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me.\n\nUPDATE: I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference.  The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s.  Also, the comfort is much better.  They don't pinch my ears like the 155s.  The cord going to the headset is also thicker, which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage.  If you're thinking of the 155s, I would get the 165s instead\n"

aS"\tExcellent player, really great purchase!!\n\tThis DVD player is great for the road, and even at home when you don't want to be bothered. Unless the are much loud noises happening around you, the players' speakers work fine. It comes with all of the accesories you'd want, including a car outlet, wall adapter, remote, and the battery. It charges in under 4 hours, and plays for over 3 hours. \n\nThe player is sleek and so is the battery, but together are a bit bulky, not bad. Screen quality is good, great for a portable. Made of good quality materials. I've had it for a month and nothing is showing signs of wear-n-tear.\n\nA recommended accessory to purchase is a carrying case, which will haul all your add-ons that are included. I bought the targus sport, which is great also. For 160 bucks, it's well worth it!\n"

aS"\tone word fits perfect, surprised!\n\tThese speakers are not what i had expected from their size, price, and looks.  Their quality, even at high volumes, exceeds many other speakers i've seen at double the price tag.  The reason I bought these was because of the other reviews and the size.  Another reason was the proposed battery life, 35 hours on 4 aaa batteries, not bad at all.  So far its been very close.  I have heard the other speaker (systems) and yes the JBL OnStage and the Bose Sounddock are both very good and do live up to their reputations, but your stuck with using them only when there is an outlet nearby\n"

aS"\tMostly Pleased, but....\n\tI spent a lot of time reviewing Toaster Ovens to replace our 8 year old Delonghi Alfredo one. Most of the others had so-so features or bad enough reviews that made me pass on them; however, with the 5-star review and Cuisinart name, I chose the TOB-30BC.  It toasts, it bakes, it looks nice and it has the knobs that my hubby likes in lieu of digital. Overall, it's a great oven and we have no complaints with it's cooking abilities or the sturdiness of the unit; but less than a month later, one of the knobs broke off the unit. They are completely plastic and no metal reinforcement to prevent this from happening. My hubby sent an email to Cuisinart and they are sending a replacement knob, but one would have expected better engineering from a name like Cuisinart\n"

I chose the Canon after reading good reviews, and I got it for an excellent price right here on Amazon plus free shipping.  It still sells for more at my local Office Depot and Best Buy. In truth I haven't tried all of it's claimed capabilities, but I'm happy with what it's been able to do thus far.\n"

aS"\tA good accessory for your iPod\n\tI purchased my iTrip about 4 months ago and now can give an objective review of the product.  The iTrip is a good choice over competitors' products and offers a good value for the money.  Radio reception is good; I especially like the changing channels feature.  The fact that it charges the iPod while in use even makes it better.  The only negative thing that I've discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the iPod slot and I have to push it back.  That's mostly due to rattles and I imagine will get worse with time.  \n\nOverall, good product, good value for the money, and if carefully handled, will last a long time.\n"

Just make sure it isn't the only phone in your home.\nb) there is a bug which occasionnally renders it unable to operate. I can't figure out what causes it.

The sound is in line with a radio/boom box of the same size and it's about the same weight. I have a lot of trees around my house so I have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal. Keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit. I have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and I can hear it all over the first floor of my home.

aS'\tGood monitor for the price\n\tMy first purchase of the Q9b resulted in a return as the display wasn\'t mounted properly within the plastic housing. This resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1/4" and made the viewing unpleasant. The screen also wasn\'t very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100%. Having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it. Suffice to say, quality control missed this one.\n\nAfter getting a new Q9b replacement, I unfortunately had a bad pixel. After using the Q9b for a week now, I noticed some red aliasing between characters. The crispness of the display is fine but I changed display fonts to 120dpi to make it look better. The control buttons on the monitor are too small. The built-in speakers leave less than desired and useless. \nThe Q9b does not have DVI ports. At 1280x1024 mode its fine for doing basic computing like web surfing and office applications. Viewing DVD movies at full 1280x1024 mode was difficult to watch.  At smaller sizes (400x300) was fine.\n\nAll in all, the Q9b is not a bad monitor for the price for general computing work\n'

aS'\tBusinessWeek ranks it above Garmin\n\tI would highly recommend reading the BusinessWeek review on this product that came out on September 12, 2005.  BusinessWeek as reviewed all the major GPS navigation options on the market and ranks the Cobra NAV ONE 4500 as number one.  Here is an excerpt from the BusinessWeek article:\n\n"Cobra\'s NAV ONE 4500 and Garmin\'s StreetPilot 2720, which each sell for $800 to $1,000, use a more straightforward approach. The traffic info travels along with FM radio broadcasts from Clear Channel stations in 48 of the top 50 markets. An FM antenna and receiver pick it off the air and feed it to the navigation system."\n\n"I preferred the Cobra, mostly for its big, bright 5-inch screen and its built-in radio receiver. (The Garmin receiver is $200 extra and needs to be installed between your car antenna and radio.) When you encounter traffic, a pop-up on the screen and a voice give you three options: Keep driving, reroute me, or give me a couple of new routes and let me pick one.\n'

I find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain, but, the product works great.

aS"\tEverything I was hoping for\n\tI am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone.  It looks good, but more importantly, it feels good.  Button placement, weight, smoothness, everything was done well.  Coming from wired mice, the lack of a wire is very freeing.  I am also especially happy with how small the USB radio receiver is.  I am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is.\n\nWhat's strange is I bought the S 530 desktop set for Mac at the same time.  The mouse in that set looks nearly identical (except for color).  However, it has a different weight and simply doesn't feel quite as comfortable to use.  It only fits the hand the same but once you move it, it lacks the same comfort and ease of use as this mouse\n"

aS"\tWorks great but...\n\tWe have a TrackMan corded model and loved it so I got this one for my work computer.  It works just as well as the corded one when I'm in my office.  For travel, the part you plug in is a little bulky so I usually leave it at home when I travel.  It's not a small, USB stick that goes in the back.  It's a long, corded, mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the TrackMan.  I don't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a USB stick instead of the other for travel.  All that said, I love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me\n"

But 5 to 8 miles between cars was not a problem. Range was somewhat reduced over hilly terrain and varied from poor to good in the Rocky Mountains. It's a great way to stay in touch when traveling. The batteries are rechargeable, both A/C  and  D/C. The ear pieces were very good for privacy. Very easy to use and well worth the price. A good investment.\n"

An HP 100 cartridge can be used\nfor black and white photos. Yes, the color cartridge must be\nexchanged for the black one when converting from color to\nblack and white and vise versa. Even so, we find the printer\nfun and very simple to use. Just keep in mind that the price\nof ink will soon exceed the price of the printer if used\noften. What we do is use it for special occasions or when\nthe grandchildren come over.\n\nGary\n"

aS'\tExcellent webcam - no video lag - superior clarity\n\tI tried both Microsoft\'s LifeCam VX-3000 and VX-6000. Had \'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and, with both of those, the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX-6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file, installed it, but the VX-6000 still produced out-of-sync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. \n\nSo, I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my, I believe, excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX-6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB\'s price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place, including, of course, here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset, which I haven\'t used so far.\n\nAlthough I haven\'t tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet, from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a "USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on, get this, the Microsoft cams! I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far.\n\nThe audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember, that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video, the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX-6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX-3000 in all other criteria too, in my opinion after comparison testing.\n\nThe Orbit\'s special effects are interesting and fun. The pan, tilt, etc., excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn - but I haven\'t tested in actual live conferencing yet.\n\nAll in all - for webcams, I\'m now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for Logitech. They\'ve certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper! Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And, my advice to Microsoft, you\'d better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I\'ve relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals, keyboards, etc., and I\'ve generally been very satisfied. But, in webcams, with me, the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech.\n'

aS'\tIncredibly Useful Gizmo\n\tGarmin iQue M5\n\nI\'m very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA.  While it\'s not perfect, it\'s pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS, but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more.  With the iQue offering so many more features, I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue.  With my husband and I both having the same machines, we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth.\n\nIt has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device, as it isn\'t very intuitive and the manuals, especially for the PDA, are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS, and he\'s learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  It\'s very sophisticated and the maps are great - better detail than the Lowrence.  We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it, and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software.  The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it, the voice directions are clear and concise, and it re-routes quickly if you go off course.  You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated.  This is a good idea, since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites, and you can be on your way if you\'ve viewed your route before starting out.\n\nI used the GPS on a trip Stratford, Canada, and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bed-and-breakfast from the theater.  Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left, which would have taken me into the Avon River!), but it\'s generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error, such as turning too soon. The "Route to Home" feature is very convenient. Granted, the iQue doesn\'t always take you on the shortest route, but it will get you where you\'re going and if you\'re "directionally challenged" like I am, it becomes indispensible.\n\nThe car mounting bracket works fine.  It\'s popped off occasionally in hot weather, but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle.  The GPS would work in a cup-holder if you needed to use it in a rental car.\n\nI\'ve spent more time learning the PDA portion, which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface, so you\'ll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before, I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it, which was helpful.  \n\nThe PDA has so many functions that it\'s hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts, checks e-mail, accesses the Internet if you get a Wi-Fi card, recognizes handwriting, has a voice recorder, interfaces with other Bluetooth units, sends alarms, has Word and Excel, even has a couple of good games.  I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs, and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists.  You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003, including TV shows and videos.  I never thought I\'d find much use for a PDA but I\'m using it every day.  No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar, address book or even an IPod.  Everything is in one handy-dandy little machine. And even though it isn\'t that intuitive, once you\'ve learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs.\n\nWe\'ve called Garmin Tech Support a few times and, although they are only open during regular business hours, we found American staff who are very knowledgeable about the product.  Since a good GPS will run at least [...], this was a great bargain at around [...]  We\'ve purchased screen protectors and are hoping it won\'t wear out too quickly, as I\'ve heard Palm Pilots tend to do.  I\'m really enjoying the iQue.\n'

aS"\tI couldn't live without it\n\tThe zen micro is brilliant I have dropped it a load of times and it still works fine i've dropped it on the kitchen tiles twice, i've dropped it a few times in the yard and it still works perfect. I had to buy new headphones for it which made the sound quality much better. It is very easy to transfer files to it I always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software. I use it everyday and the battery lasts a good while for me.\nOverall the zen micro is a very good product\n"

aS'\tGreat features\n\tMy favorite thing about this phone is that the caller ID captures 11 digit numbers (1-xxx-xxx-xxxx) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call.  My old phone only captured 10 digits (xxx-xxx-xxxx) which meant I had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first.  This new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number.  I put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in.  Very handy.  As far as being a phone, it does everything well and after a couple of months I am still as happy as could be with it\n'

aS"\tFirst MP3 player I ever owned and not disappointed\n\tI had been talking about wanting an MP3 player, but I did NOT want an iPod, as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006, and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks, overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.\n\nLike many rechargeable battery-powered items, it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that, the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down, I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.\n\nI installed the software on my computer, and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual, and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). \n\nIt came pre-loaded with 20 songs, only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those no-name bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices, I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.\n\nAs far as performance goes, it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to, as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad, but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there, you will be scrolling a lot.  \n\nI do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music, fm radio, photo, voice, video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option, both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files, I have not had any problems, although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded, but when you try to play it, it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also, you can only store a song as one genre, which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player, you cannot change the genre.\n\nIt came with a headset, but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.  \n\nI do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything, so I don't know what caused this, but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation, just the aesthetics.\n\nOverall, the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod\n"

aS"\tbetter than most\n\tSince there are very few cases that fit iPAQ PDAs, I recommend you get this one.  Depending on type of your iPAQ (1900 series vs 3000 series), you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case.  Once you're done, however, it's very easy to use and carry.  It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use.  The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket, unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface, this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).  The leather feels surprisingly good, almost a lambskin kind of quality.  The credit card space is not very useful, but you can shove a couple of business cards in there. A solid 4 stars until anything better becomes available\n"

aS"\tLove it\n\tI found this on clearance at another retailer (I guess not everyone likes pink), and it's fabulous.  I thought it might be just for skinny-armed people, but not so!  I've got plenty of room, it fits great, and it doesn't move.  Still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way, though.  Makes mowing the lawn WAY more fun\n"

aS'\tHow to deregister phone\n\tThe phone works great!. I have three of these and a base. The best phones I have had. The other phones I have are the TCX800 model (previous version), equally good.\n\nI had trouble deregistering one of the phones, as it has to be close to the original base (kept telling me out of range). I found out that pressing END and #, also deregisters\n'
p396
aS"\tGood quality phones\n\tGreat sound quality; great signal quality.  I can hear everyone well, and the people on the other end of the call can also hear me well.  The main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger, with a couple walls in between, and I have no problems with signal.\n\nThe handsets are smaller than I expected, but that's actually a bonus since I hadn't bought a new phone in a while and thought my old handset was too big and clunky.  The handsets are about 6 inches long not including the antenna part, 1 and 7/8 inches at the widest point by the display, and 1 and 1/8 inches thick at the thickest point.\n\nDoesn't interfere with my wireless internet or any of my other electronics.  I've used the phone while sitting next to my laptop, while both I and the chargers were next to TV and stereos, and with my cell phone going at the same time - no interference.\n\nThe speakerphone part isn't that great - the person on the other end can hear other sounds in the room, plus they say it sounds like I'm speaking from a great distance away.  But I've never had a phone with a good speakerphone, so wasn't expecting that to work anyway.\n\nWould have been great if they'd included a headset that goes with it since the handsets do have headset jacks.  I love the extra handsets that only need to be plugged into a power outlet - solved my lack of working jacks problem!!\n\nThe display lights up when it rings and when you press any of the keys.  The keys are not backlit.  The menus are fairly intuitive - if you've ever had a cell phone you can figure this out pretty easily.  It's very easy to send phone numbers that you've programmed into one handset to all the other handsets or only to a specific handset.\n\nWhen I first hooked everything up, the phones got no dial tone, but the problem was with the phone cord that plugs into the phone jack in the wall.  For some reason, the cord they provided didn't work, so when I swapped it out with the cord I had, all the phones worked fine.\n\nI'd buy these again and recommend to others to buy\n"

aS'\tDoes what its supposed too but...\n\tI just got my quickcam and it was very easy to setup.  I had some trouble focussing though since it is manual focus and the ring was stuck.  However, with some nudging it finally loosened up and now the picture is crystal clear.  It is so small and just excellent.  Great work, Logitech\n'

aS"\tCANON'S BEST VALUE FOR PHOTO PRINTING... TRULY AMAZING\n\tI have the Canon MP500 printer and Canon Rebel XT camera - both capable of producing amazing results, but paper makes a HUUUUGE diference in photo printing. I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers. If you are looking to print out very impressive photos, then I would recommend getting the 8x10 Photo Plus Glossy - definitely nice enough to frame. And with Plus glossy, you're definitely saving $ instead of paying $$$ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store. And I even scanned a professional photo that I had done last year with my MP500 and printed using Plus Glossy, and the print is significantly better than the original. \n\nPros: Best Value Canon has to offer. Great, great prints, my favorite paper overall. As good as Pro, and less expensive.  About 55 cents per page in a 30 page pack of Pro compared to 40 cents per page in a 20 page pack of Plus.\n\nCons: None at all so far.  have not seen if photos last over time\n"

aS"\tBest paper for Canon printers\n\tI tested my new Canon i960 with a variety of papers. Like most printers, the output is much better when using the manufacture's own paper (as opposed to the cheaper generic paper), but there is no need to buy the most expensive  and quot;Pro and quot; paper as neither I nor my wife could discern ANY difference between the two. There may be a benifit to the  and quot;Pro and quot; paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)\n"
