S'\tbad\n\tcons\ntips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top\n\npoorly designed, it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds, so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it\n\nputting it together was a pain, the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes.\n\nagain..poorly designed... doesnt even fit cds that well, there are gaps, and the cd casses are loose fitting\n\npros\n..........\ni guess it can hold a lot of cds....\n'
p1
aS"\tSave your money!\n\tIt's a nice look, but it tips over very easily. It is not steady on a rug surface dispite what the picture on the box shows. My advice is if you need a CD rack that holds a lot of CD's? Save your money and invest in something nicer and more sturdy\n"

aS"\tCases break instantly!\n\tI knew these were inexpensive CD cases, but I can't even open one without it breaking into two pieces..\n"

aS"\tThese DVD-Rs suck\n\tI used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration\n"
p4
aS"\tWaste Of Money\n\tI bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products\n"
p5
aS"\tis it live or is it memorex?\n\tI hope it's live because if it's memorex, it's crap!  that's my latest opinion after using this product.  I have a LiteOn SOHW-802S and it hates Memorex.  I rarely get a decent burn.  More often than not I'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it.  My movies will skip, stutter, or stop all together.  So disappointing!  Unfortunately I found out too late that Memorex uses CMC media, which only has a 0-50% success rate!  [...\n"

aS"\tbeware, re- bate not honored!\n\ti knew the cash back offer sounded too good to be true...and sure enough they rejected my upcs (i kept copies) only have hounding them and contacting the better business bureau did they say 'whoops a mistake' i have a fleeting suspicion this was intentional\n"
p7
aS'\tNo Cash Back Here!\n\tPlease don\'t expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised!  To date, I\'ve been denied twice.  The second time they said the U P C number was invalid. Only, it\'s the original U P C barcode!  I was meticulous filing the paperwork, yet they state, "All required products were not submitted."  Meanwhile, I have phoned AMAZ0N to lodge a formal complaint.\n\nThe product itself is average.  I\'ve used better and worse.  That said, it\'s definitely not worth the full asking price\n'
p8
aS"\tTINSTAAFL\n\tNo free lunch  and  you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product?\n\nWell, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product..\n"
p9
aS'\tPoor quality - avoid\n\tI have a collection of over 1500 disks so I have bought many cd/dvd cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that I have purchased.  I would avoid this brand.\n\n[...\n'

aS'\tWell built, poorly suited.\n\tI purchased this game pad due to good reviews.\nFound it online for $15 with free shipping so had to try myself.\nIts true its built well and pretty comfortable in the hand.\nThe programming software is alright as well, not as nice as\nthe Nostromo n50/52 software for example.\n\nBut what i didnt like about it was much more relavant.\nFirstly there is a toggle lock shift button.\nThis button is easy to press by accident and since it is not\na momentary button you have to go back and press it off agian.\nInterupting game play.\n\nAlso buttons 7 and 8 are not paddles but rather thumb, and quite far from normal thumb use. I had a hard time using those buttons quickly.\n\nAlso the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to 8 total buttons rather than 10.\n\nAnd finally, for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in NHL06, i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back, and ill soon go with the logitech\n'

aS"\tI Would Never Recommend this Product to Anyone\n\tI've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row.  I've spent hours with this product on several machines and I can now say the hardware sucks.\n"
p13
aS'\tFreezes and tech help not good\n\tI purchased dvd express and it never worked. I spent endless time with tech support. The old story about, "It must be your computer." did not fly either, my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS. I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead\'s Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS\'s product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn\'t consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don\'t think they want a product like that either. The only reason I gave one star is.....it was packed well.\nJU\n'

aS'\tSad compared to older Models\n\tJust purchased 3 units , thought they would work as well as the Novi units they were replacing however they have absolutely no range . My original Novi 2 channel units worked well from a distance of approx 110 ft from house to barn , these only work in the same room... I am attempting to return these currently.\n'
p15
aS"\tLook for other alternatives...\n\tI bought four of these and returned them immediately. Two were dead out of the box. A third had horrible sound.\n\nAfter searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products I finally settled on the 900 Megahertz Wireless Intercom from Radio Shack. (43-3102)\n\nBeautiful sound. Well made and about half the price of the Reporter. Pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet. So if you need more than 300 feet for range it's something to consider. Better warranty than the Reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year.\n\nAnyway I couldn't be happier with the RS intercom. I just can't recommend the Reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty\n"
p16
aS"\tworked great at first......\n\tWhen I purchased these batteries, I was very pleased, but that wore off after a couple of months. I don't use my camera all that often, but when I do, I expect ther batteries to have some charge. I recharge them per instructions, and they do not hold a charge any longer.I know Monster makes good products, but I am a little disappointed in this one\n"
p17
aS'\tKODAK CARD READER\n\tI got this from JnR . This unit powers up but the computer fails to detect it. I tried this on multiple computers. MAy be this was just a lemon. I will exchange it to a better brand\n'
p18
aS'\tNot suitable for heavy books\n\tThis bookstand, despite the description, is not suitable for heavy books. If you put heavy books on this, the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off.\n'
p19
aS"\tFlimsy product.\n\tIts made of flimsy plastic, and all the parts snap on. I'm afraid to put a heavy book on there, because I'm sure the parts will just snap off\n"
p20
aS'\tSent it back\n\tI had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds. The sound quality was good, but the dependability of this item is questionable.\n'
p21
aS'\tpoor customer service\n\tI purchased this memory card for a camera I was also purchasing. It was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page. When I received the card first and then the camera, I was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit. Because I had opened the plastic package to the card, I was unable to return it. In fact, when I emailed the company who sent it, I never even received a response.\n'
p22
aS"\tTold by company that it would take up to four weeks!\n\tI am the type of person that ALWAYS buys the extra warranty on whatever I purchase.  However, I started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still hadn't received their refund check.  I was astonished.  I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this.  With no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps, I was informed that if I did everything by email, it would take AT LEAST 15 business days (that's three weeks!) to receive my refund check AFTER I sent them the warrantied item.  If I had them send me a pre-paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer, it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item.  In other words, it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks!  I cancelled the contract immediately.  It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract.  I would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as Grado, Sennheiser or Koss.  But stay away from these people; that's my feeling and my advice.\n"
p23
aS'\tI\'ve finally learned a VERY expensive lesson\n\tDON\'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!\n\nSecond ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn\'t).\n\nOther than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I\'m just sorry that it didn\'t last (twice!) cause otherwise I\'d be a fan\n'
p24
aS'\tBack-UPS ES drops power AFTER power is restored!\n\tMost people buy a UPS, plug it in and never test it to make sure it works. I tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage. I set it to shutdown Windows after 1 minute. Only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it. \n\nAfter power was cut, it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down. Then I restored power to the UPS. AFter about 30 seconds, it beeped, clicked, and temporarily DROPPED power to the computer while it was rebooting! So when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted. That is unacceptable. A UPS should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it.\n'
p25
aS"\tBeware!\n\tIf you have a cable modem for broadband connection to the internet, your unit will not be covered by the APS warranty on this device. Lightning hit near our house and the motherboard plus router got fried. The cable modem stayed intact and we filed a claim with APS. They denied it saying backend surges through the cable may have caused the damage (even though the modem wasn't hurt?)\n"
p26
aS'\tUnresolved problem\n\tI am still awaiting resolution of a problem I have with these drives. In writing DVDs I get verification errors. This proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure. The drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the IDE bus, but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire\n'

aS'\tWorked OK for about 230 days, then stopped.\n\tThe drive arrived at the end of December, was quick to get up and running, and worked fine until yesterday.  Then it got the machine equivalent of "lockjaw" and I\'ve been unable to get the tray to release.\n\nSo, it\'s a good drive while it operates, but I\'ll probably make sure I pay for at least a 1-year warranty on my next purchase.\n\nAs far as my recommendation goes, it depends very much on how inconvenient it is when one\'s drive fails.  Yesterday, I just went to a backup burner and kept working; if I had NEEDED to get the job done, and I had not previously developed a strategy of always keeping a backup device handy, I\'d have been in a seething, hair-pulling rage.  Computer hardware is never 100% reliable, but is it worth the risk to purchase a device that is known to fail in less than a year\n'
p29
aS"\tGarbage-stopped working after 2 months of extremely gentle use\n\tI never even traveled with it. It just stopped working completely making me lose data.\n\nNEVER AGAIN I'll buy anything from this company. This drive is a piece of rubbish!\n"

aS"\tsorry - didn't do the job for me\n\ti've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD, the sound from my system did seem to be a little better (the CD's were not skipping as much).  but the bottom line is it didn't fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably, although not as bad as before.  ... not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk CD changer\n"
p32
aS'\tThis junk died and erased 100 images\n\tThe is perhaps the lease durable item I have purchased in 40 years. It lights up just fine, and it is a reassuring led gold, but it refuses to do anything with my xd card. It worked just fine for 3-4 days, then erased about 100 photos, all of them irreplaceable. Cheap yes, but Cheap Junk.\n'
p33
aS'\tBroken within hours. JUNK!\n\tI ordered this item after reading the positive reviews here. BIG MISTAKE. Upon setting everything up, it all worked great for about two hours... then the dreaded "UNPLUG/PROTECT" screen came up. Now it won\'t turn on but for a few moments before returning to protect mode. (and no, it\'s not a short in the wires or overheating... it protects even when stone cold, and with no speakers plugged in) I called sony and they say it is a short in the box. So now my two options are to unhook everything, repack EXACTLY the way it came to me and reship back to the online store I bought it from (with enormous hastle and expense) or take the receiver in to a sony authorized service center (which happens to be across town, and only open monday-friday, 9-5pm. So much for being convenient). This thing is brand new and already needs repairs!!\n\nOn top of that, even out of the box, NONE of the video inputs worked. Audio was fine, but video was dead as a doornail, right from the start.\n\nAnd even on top of the fact that this machine CAME broken... it sucks even when it works right! The DVDs take forever to load, and it comes with HDMI out, but NO HDMI IN! So if you\'re an HDMI user, I hope you have multiple HDMI inputs on your television... one for your cable box, one for this crappy system.\n\nThis is a piece of junk. For the love of god, don\'t waste your money\n'
p34
aS"\tGet a 2G!\n\tWhy would you want this item? Amazon is charging $50 MORE on this item than the 2nd Generation Shuffle! And, according to what I have read, THIS Shuffle isn't very derable. It doesn't even last a year! I don't know about you, but I'LL get a 2nd Generation Shuffle\n"
p35
aS'\tDied suddenly... repair impractical, lost my stuff\n\tOne day it just stopped working. I got the dreaded "orange and green flashing lights of death"... the contents of the File space were un-recoverable... and I ended up just pitching it after extensive attempts to revive it.\n\nApparently this is yet another one of the bad products that Apple likes to keep hush-hush\n'
p36
aS'\tUnreliable.  Cute Design.  Bad Engineering.  Poor Quality Control\n\tMy shuffle suffered the blinking green-orange lights so I took it into the Apple store. A salesman took 15 minutes to figure out that he couldn\'t do anything, and said I would have to sign up for a appointment at the "Genius" bar. At that appointment, the "genius" said he couldn\'t fix it, and because he said he didn\'t know anything about engineering he couldn\'t say whether the shuffle was not working because of a software or a hardware problem or both. Apparently being an Apple "genius" doesn\'t involve understanding how things work, though it does appear to require having a trendy haircut. The \'genius" then offered a $10 discount on the purchase of a new shuffle - but couldn\'t answer the question of why anyone would want to waste money on such a poorly designed thing.\n\nPerhaps it should be retitled the "idiot bar.\n'
p37
aS'\tBroke very easily\n\tThe extendable arm breaks very easily.  I had two of them and they both broke within the first month.  The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement.  Very poor product.  Do not buy\n'
p38
aS"\tGarbage!\n\tTo back up my personal DVD collection I burned 200 discs.  100 on these Memorex DVD+R's, 100 on Philips DVD+R's.  EVERY Memorex had flaws during playback.  EVERY Philips was flawless.  I've been buying Memorex for years but I'll never buy Memorex again\n"
p39
aS'\tbroke after 1+ year\n\tOverall the recorder worked OK. A moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded DVDs could not be finalized for unexplained reasons.\nHowever, that is irrelevant now. A few weeks ago, the unit stop working. I does not turn on at all. What a waist! It is out of warranty now\n'
p40
aS'\tShort-lived machine--avoid this lemon\n\tHere is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:\n\nWe bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we\'d recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we\'re not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you\'re within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we\'ve used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We\'re actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I\'ll try to post again with the results.\n\nHere is my update, which I wrote November 3:\n\nThis is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing "the entire internal mechanism" (I don\'t know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it\'s now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we\'ve been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I\'m going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It\'s still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won\'t. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn\'t had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We\'re still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.\n'
p41
aS"\tTemporary device\n\tI would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months.  There is a reason the warranty is only 90 days.  The performance (sound quality) steadily declines over time.  The ihome worked great when it was new, but it won't play songs from the ipod anymore, and the radio is a static box\n"
p42
aS"\tiHome is a disappointment\n\tSo when I first got the iHome for Christmas, I loved it. Well, I loved it in spite of the glaring bright light, that even at its lowest setting has to be blocked for me to get to sleep. However, after awhile the iHome will not register my iPods existence at all. Today I was able to enjoy thirty seconds of a song before it fell into disgrace again. I would not recommend this product if you want something that lasts. This device has become nothing more than a nuisance that won't even pick up radio stations. So, the alarm can only be set to a vaguely annoying beep when these functions are disabled. Useless\n"
p43
aS"\tToo bright!  Not for light sleepers!\n\tWe have had ours for almost a year - it still works great, but there is one big problem - the display is a white/violet bright light.  Great for visibility of the clock when you need it, but unfortunately, even when it's on the lowest setting, it lights up our whole room!  My husband sleeps through it fine, but I need a dark room to fall asleep and I always have to throw a sweater or towel over it.  We finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio\n"
p44
aS"\tGreat Features, Unreliable Connections\n\tI like the features.  I'm satisfied with the sound.  The user interface could be more intuitive.\n\nHOWEVER, my overriding complaint is that the docking port (as many other reviewers have mentioned) is not reliable.  The connection is poorly constructed, so just walking by the table on which it sits is often enough to make it think the iPod isn't there any more.  If they could fix this quality problem, it would be well worth the $100, but since it is very hard to get it to recognize the connection reliably you just can't justify it at any price\n"
p45
aS"\tKILLS COMPUTER / UN-STOPPABLE SHRIEK ALARM\n\tI mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would PROTECT my computer from BEING KILLED, but instead, this thing has KILLED my computer FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 4 DAYS, EMITTING AN UN-STOPPABLE(i.e., CAN'T TURN THE FEATURE OFF) SHRIEK ALARM. How do smart, talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear-piercing shriek-alarm that can't be defeated / silenced? \nIn addition to doing far, far more damage than it can ever prevent, ask yourself -- do you want this un-stoppable ear-piercing shriek alarm going off in your house at 2a.m.? I BOUGHT ONE APC PRODUCT, AND SO FAR, THEY'RE 100% DEFECTIVE AND 100% DELITERIOUS TO THE USE OF MY COMPUTER  and  IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT'S DELITERIOUS TO MY SLEEP.\n"
p46
aS"\tNO SUPPORT\n\tLet's be honest.\nThis product ain't cheap. It's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working. \nI bought mine at cpenusa.com. Delivery was great, only took them a couple of days. However, my c-pen cable was damaged. The connector to the c-pen was, for some reason, cut in half. Without it, you can't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc.\nI called their main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours. NO RESPONSE. I sent three e-mails to cpenusa. NO RESPONSE.\nI don't care if the product itself is great(I'll never know now, will I..). If you're unable to receive support when you need 'em, you're screwed. \nIf you're just interested in electronic equipments, just want to try things out and don't really care if you're on your own, go ahead and try it. Let me know how this thing really is. Otherwise, buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after-sales support\n"

aS"\tGreat for a while, and then not so good\n\tThis was a great mouse for about the first year I owned. After one year is when all of the problems started.  The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all.  I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help.  It is very tempremental, and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement.\n\nSo, a word to the wise - in my experience the mouse will work great for a while, just be prepared to replace it in a year or so\n"

aS'\tSony RM-AX4000\n\tThis is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote. I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly. At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off).\n'

aS"\tdoes not work!!\n\tWith a full charge it does not last more than 10min, could not take more than more 15 pics in my camera Canon Pro1. The original battery works well more than 250 pics on each charge. Initially I thought this problem was because it was new battery but after several cycles it does not work at all. I'll try to get a refund and check their customer service too\n"

aS"\tCheck compatibility with writer BEFORE buying media!\n\tOne out of every 4 discs would fail on me when I'd burn to this media at 4x. Slowing down the burn to 2x didn't help either! I own a Sony DRU500A with the latest firmware. Memorex isn't on their compatibility list. Lesson learned: check the compatibility list BEFORE buying\n"

aS'\tThe worst brand I\'ve tried.\n\tI\'ve got a LITE-ON DVDRW SOHW-1673S burner (Revision JS02) in my fast G4 Mac running OS X Tiger and burning with Toast Titanium 7. Although my burner is nominally 16X-capable, it only burns at about 6X in my setup, probably due to the slow (ATA 33) bus it\'s on.\n   I\'ve used a number of different brands of 8X and 16X disks, both +R and -R, and have had a verification failure rate of less than 2% -- so few, in fact, that I often don\'t bother verifying video DVD\'s anymore when burning TDK or Maxell discs. (I always verify data DVD\'s, since errors in those are not ignorable.) But with Memorex, I\'ve gotten about 20% failures, including a couple of aborted burns! In one case, the disc had a blank band between two burned ones!\n   The Memorex discs I\'m referring to have Manufacturer ID "CMC MAG, AM3". According to videohelp.com, these are sold under at least 7 different brand names. The reviews there are rather mixed, which is not IMHO good enough!\n   I have not, BTW, have had any problems with the Memorex DVD+R discs I\'ve tried. But I stopped using them because one of my players won\'t recognize the +R format\n'

aS"\tUnacceptable\n\tThis model was intended as a replacement for my not-very-old and yet quite functional Panasonic PM-series stereo.  This is the kind of thing that happens when you browse Amazon while drunk late at night.  \n\nUnfortunately, with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality, the Sony is in all respects inferior; ergonomics, appearance, and above all, FM reception, which is laughably poor.  Do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver.  Hiss abounds, several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable, and to top it off, Sony has stuck with their time-honored habit of using proprietary connectors, so when I went to plug in an after-market antenna to get better reception, I found a weird little plug that I hadn't noticed when I put the damned thing together.  Grrr.  So now I'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds.  Death to Sony\n"

aS"\tNot Very Durable. Will need battery changes.\n\tI have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS\n"

aS"\tOkay, I guess...\n\tWhile the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice (feels grippy but not sticky if you know what I mean), some of the features are just wrong.  For instance, the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all - requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off.  Also, for whatever reason, the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use (the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out).  \nThe armband is satisfactory at best - it's just a standard, no frills, velcro armband\n"

aS"\tChinese made Junk - save your money!\n\tI was tempted by the cheap price and got myself a 10 pack. They are rated at 2000 mAh, but run out of juice after the digital camera has shot maybe 5 frames. My 2 year old Panasonic 1600 mAh in contrast can run the same camera for over a 100 shots. I tried these batteries in my MP3 player - and even there, it won't supply enough juice after an hr worth of playback. It is not that the battery does not hold any charge - that it has. But it just does not supply the peak current required by most digital devices. It seems to be all right for use in a flashlight. A set of batteries that will not power a camera will power a flashlight (a bit dimly) for hours (yeah - I tested it). For the test, I had  charged the panasonics and the lenmars for the same duration (it is not a charger issue).\nI plan to complain to the state consumer affairs department regarding this brand and hope action is taken against shady products which are nothing but rip-offs.\nOne last tip - nowadays, the best NiMH batteries are made by Sanyo. It is better to pay 2 - 4 times for them than for a Lenmar. Trust me\n"

aS"\tDon't Buy if near US/Canada Border\n\tThis GPS comes with US map on the SD card and Canada map on the included CD but never the twain shall meet.\n\nBy car I'm a few hours from Canada and several days from the eastern US but I can't swap out the faraway eastern US part of the map on the TomTom Go 300 for a nearby Canadian map.  It's either all Canada or all contiguous US.  This is a major functional flaw if you live near the US/Canada border or live further away and like to take cross-border trips.\n\nOh, and if you do decide to swap out the US map, be sure to save it on your computer first - TomTom doesn't bother to provide a backup on the CD so if you don't first make your own backup before changing to the Canadian map you can't later get the US map back\n"
p60
aS"\tGood potential, but nasty\n\tThe Tomtom has great features.  But I returned mine.  First, the maps are very dated.  This makes it iffy at best.  It has terrific potential, if it worked.  You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip.  It's amazing.  But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints.  But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints, main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route, and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.  Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would.  The manual was no help.  Support was no help.  So it went back.  I have ordered a Garmin i2.  Hope this is ok.  I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330.  The Garmin has maps that you cannot update, but got me to my destination no problem.\n\nI don't recommend this TomTom.  Do research.  Go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals.\n\nHope this helps\n"

aS'\tWaste of money\n\tThis is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons.\n\n1. This hub will not work with any USB powered devices.

Does not comke with a power adapte\n'
p63
aS'\tLove affair gone sour\n\tI have owned this little hub for at least a year. I have an older PC which came without USB, so I added a PCI adapter. I soon realized that I needed more ports, and more convenience, than the two now located in the backplane of the PC on the floor.\n\nI shopped around, and this item looked appropriate. As for the short cord, I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time. Besides solving the immediate problem, this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point, and using the extension cord for some other purpose.\n\nFor a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I attached an external hard drive through it. I used it for a compact flash card reader, and a digital camera. I connected an inkjet printer. Everything worked, once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly. (This was all with Windows 98 SE.)\n\nBut after a while, things started getting less reliable. The system would tell me that various "drives" (on the flash card reader, or the external hard drive) were not available. Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software. And the printer even started disappearing.\n\nPlaying with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life, and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose, or with wiring inside the device. Either way, it has finally become a big problem, and I am shopping for a replacement.\n\nMost of the devices I connected were self-powered, that is, they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all. The hard drive, camera, and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own. And the flash card reader, which did draw power from the hub, used to work fine. It does not matter what combination of devices I try, sooner or later the connection goes bad.\n\nIt is of course possible that there\'s something wrong in the PC -- but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself. So I have to recommend against buying it. I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won\'t be necessary for much longer, but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I\'ve been through, just in case\n'

aS'\tUnable to install, despite reaching D-Link technical support\n\tFrom looking at the D-Link website and talking to five tech support staff, it appears that there are countless versions of this card, each with different driver software. The one I got came with a CD with the wrong drivers. With tech support, I finally found the 8 mb driver file I was supposed to download. However, they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver. The normal "automatic" approach did not work. And their instructions did not match the screens I was getting on Windows XP SP 2.\nSo I called back again. And again. And again. \nDespite being given a case file, each time I was asked the same questions, including what, exactly, is wrong. And each time I was told to do the same thing: Install from the CD. Reboot. Remove the program. Reboot. Install from the new driver. Reboot. Remove the program. Talk to a senior tech support person.\nInstall from CD. Reboot. etc.\nIt would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the CD. A clearly designed website would be second best. And tech support that knows what they\'re doing and speaks intelligble English would be a nice last resort. \nI spent three hours calling D-Link technical support and speaking to five people, and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card!\nI am not alone in this experience; see cnet\'s web site user reviews of the DWL-G650. \nAnother reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system. I believe he is right. It appears to have damaged my screen font for Windows message boxes. I have been unable to repair it. The DWL-G650 is bad news.\nI give them two stars cause they actually have tech support, though in this case it was utterly worthless. \nBack it goes\n'

aS"\tAre there two m230s ?\n\tI have read all 181 reviews and decided that half the reviewers did not get the model that I did.\n\nOr else they wrote their review too soon.\n\nI bought mine in June 2006.  It failed before the store warranty ran out.  One down.  The replacement lasted a month or two before it hung and wouldn't boot.  Two down.  Sandisk honored their 1 year warranty with a prompt free RMA.  That one also failed.  Three down.  They replaced it with both a m230 AND a 2GB c150.  The c150 hung after about 2 weeks.  Four down.  I have been using the m230 for two weeks now and hope it lasts until the c150 replacement arrives.  I have gotten quite good at the RMA game and intend to keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or I get one of those that other people rave about.\n\nI don't think I'll buy another SanDisk - unless it is free and has a lifetime warranty.\n\nI suggest that everyone with a failed m230 to exercise thier warranty rights.

I can understand having a few problematic discs but this is insane to have a whole pack of discs and every single one of them messes up for you. I wish I could send these discs back and get a refund. This purchase has scared me away from anything else related to Memorex. I thought Memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers. I guess I was wrong. And apparently you get what you pay for. Don't be fooled by the good price. You'll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that wouldn't even be worth using as a frisbee.

I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said  and quot;it IS ON!! and quot; This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing\n"

My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100-240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1-2 min., but only manages 3 sec.  In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously.

aS'\tGreat While It Lasted, but\n\tMy Sangean DT200V pocket radio failed after 2.5 years of infrequent use.  I kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes.  It worked perfectly on the few occasions when I used it over the 2.5 year period, until yesterday.  The buttons, switches, and display still work perfectly, but only very faint white noise can be heard, whether via speaker or via earphone.  The volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control.  The batteries are new, and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries.\n'

aS'\tVery Cheap and "Plasticy"\n\tThis has to be the worst keyboard I\'ve purchased.  It\'s my first wireless.  I\'ve used and sold several keyboards and none have fealt as cheap as this.\n\nWith the added snap-on plastic palm rest it sets the base up too high.  Without it there is a \'hump\' where your palms go that puts your hands an an uncomfortable angle.\n\nThe plastic is really bad.  It feels really cheap and slick.  \n\nBefore I purchased this I had been trying to get in tough with Logitech about their products and compatability but they never bothered to respond.  \n\nSo, bad product....company on the slide.....doesn\'t add up to a good value.  \n\nLogitech used to be the best company out there...or at least one of the best...\n'

aS"\tdisappointed with the mouse\n\tThough I like the keyboard, I've found two serious problems with the mouse.  First, it is very sensitive to movement.  I've tried making some adjustments but it is still difficult to control.  Finally and more importantly, the mouse burns a set of AA batteries about every 8 days.  I only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so I should be getting a lot more battery life.  I've bought other Logitech products and have been pleased with them but in this case I wish I had bought another brand.\n"

aS'\tSlower than molasses--until I formatted it.\n\tNOTE TO EVERYONE WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS CARD--I reformatted it in my camera and it works fine now!!\nInitially I wrote:\nI was very disappointed in the shot-to-shot speed with this card (using a Minolta Xg).  The Panasonic card that came with the camera, which I thought would be cheap, is THREE TIMES FASTER than this "upgrade".  This card is useless to me as it cripples the camera I bought it to work in.  It takes FOURTEEN SECONDS from one shot to the next with this card.  With the original card, it\'s less than four seconds.  The claim that this is a "high speed" card is dishonest.  This is the slowest card I\'ve ever used.  I will throw this card away rather than curse someone else with it.\n'

aS"\tAll setup as described here, UNIT NOT STABLE.\n\tAfter reading the detailed reports here for how to setup this Linksys gaming adapter unit, everything worked great for several days. I setup the fixed IPs, and all the rest of the settings through the web interface, all seemed well. \n\nNote: I'm a network engineer, so the dual-fixed-ip recommendation [one for each segment] is actually pretty normal in other network bridging appliances. I suspect the MS game adapter simply performs the DHCP handshake better than this unit and that is why it is so easy to setup. \n\n\nThen the weird stuff started. \n\nAfter having had this unit turned on for several days, I notice the connection would become slow and not quite as fast as when the Linksys is first turned on. Yet, the XBOX still shows the signal between 48 and 54 Mbps. Strange. \n\nI have reproduced this several times, booting the linksys device, then playing all kinds of games online for hours, running XBMC and playing media through the network perfectly. All is good for several hours, but come back the next day after leaving the Linksys on all day/night, turn on the XBOX, and the network connection is spotty again, but the link details show a full speed connection in the XBOX wireless interface details. \n\nA swift power cycle of the Linksys unit solves the problem immediately, but why should I need to do this? I suspect some NIC buffer is being filled on the Linksys and the power cycle clears out the unit's network buffers. \n\nIf anyone has figured out what settings to use to keep this thing stable, I am ready to listen, maybe I should select a G-only network and set the speed at 54 or 48 fixed, maybe that will work? \n\nAnyway, I am getting tired of power cycling this thing every day. \n\nGood Luck, \nF.\n"

My only option is to buy a new one and wasn't even offered a discounted price for it.  I have seen several complaints like mine about KOSS on the web.  They make JUNK and they make it to last just to get past the warranty period and then it breaks.  Oh, by the way I loved it until it broke\n"

aS'\tNot a good product\n\tI purchased this to have a stereo for my iPod for primary use in my office, but to take with me other places.  I have the 30 gig Video ipod - it fits loosly.

Bottom line - Save your money!!\n'

aS'\tNeeds Significant Improvement\n\tI replaced a Siemens 8825 with the Motorola 7081 and was, unfortunately, really disappointed. The 8825 while rich in function, is quite lacking in quality. So what\'s good about the 7081 is:\n\n1.\tGreat design and feel, especially the handset.\n2.\tNice look to the unit.\n3.\tWell-lit displays.\n4.\tEasy to understand voice prompts when accessing remotely.\n5.\tReasonable range.\n6.\tNice feel to the buttons.\n7.\tFairly easy to go through the setup.\n8.\tAbility to sort the phonebook alphabetically.\n9.\tBase has phonebook that can be shared by the handsets.\n10.\tMotorola customer support (excellent).\n\nNow what\'s not good:\n\n1.\tEven at maximum volume, you can barely hear the speakerphone on                 \n        the base.\n2.\tSound on the handset is distorted, fuzzy. The person on the other\n        end hears a hiss. The volume is adequate, but barely.\n3.\tCannot search the phonebook. If you sorted it alphabetically and\n        need to access a name starting with "Z" you have to scroll through \n        the entire phonebook.\n4.\tCan\'t record an outgoing message remotely.\n5.\tBattery level indicator on handset is useless. When the handset is \n        in the charging cradle, it shows a charging indication at all\n        times. When it is out of the cradle, it doesn\'t show anything.\n\nI really wanted to like this unit because it has such a nice look and feel to it but the poor sound quality is a showstopper.\n'

aS"\tUnacceptable\n\tI have had this phone for 20 hours - and am returning it.\n\nThere is static noise on the line when people talk on the other end.  The echo of my voice from the earpiece is very distracting - I find it very disconcerting.\n\nThe wall mount bracket causes the base to stick straight out from the wall - and as a previous reviewer mentioned, is usually up to your nose given the location of most wall mounts.  This strikes me as an unexcusable oversight on Motorola's part.  Either make it desk only - or do the wall mount right.\n\nThe speaker for the speakerphone feature is in the back of the phone - while the microphone is in the front of the phone.  Dumb design - I feel like I'm either not listening or not being picked up when talking.\n\nThe volume on the base speakerphone is too low at highest setting.\n\nI'm very disappointed in this phone.  Much like a previous reviewer, the 1 star is only because I couldn't give it a 0 star rating\n"

aS'\tiPod is Great - iTunes makes it suck!\n\tAfter using RCA and Creative (both suck), I decided to try an iPod--this one since only a moron watches video on a 3-4 inch screen.\n\niTunes doesn\'t like M$ too much I guess. iTunes is really crappy software. If you have a big WMA audio collection, go elsewhere. Conversion causes sound quality loss especially if you ripped at 64kbps. Protected files can\'t be converted so you have to burn to a CD then let iTunes rip it.\n\nIf you don\'t use iTunes to buy music, 5 stars. If you do, 1 star.\n\nThe iPod, which I returned after discovering it would take months to convert to iPod compatibility, is flawlessly designed and takes a licking.\n\nGoogle "itunes problems" and you\'ll find a lot of hate for iTunes.\n\nMy problem: why NOT support WMA files? iPod would grab 99% of the market if they did and kill the upcoming M$ MP3 player that will even play iTunes stuff\n'

I was disapointed and frustrated.  All the connections and settings were correct, but it didn't work.  I have an older DVI connection instead of the newer HDMI digital connection.\n\nI returned the product and bought the Humax brand HDTV tuner.  I bought a DVI to HDMI cable and connected the unit.  It works like a charm!  I don't know what was wrong with the Samsung SIR-T451, but I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  I'm also having second thoughts about Samsung products now.  It seems like the reliability/quality factor of Samsung products has declined now that they are more mainstream\n"

aS'\tMetal stablized system...\n\tOn the back of the package it says - \n 1) Transparent sound and powerful bass. - The "Transparent sound" part is true and "powerful bass" part is totally untrue.\n 2) Metal stabilized system for high levels. - What was that again? Metal stabilized system?? It has antiroll crossbars I guess!!\n\nWhen companies start making vague claims about their product - thats when you know that there is a problem.\n\nThese sounded terrible at first - no bass - period. \n\nThe sound changed for the better once I put on the foam covers. I could hear some bass at that point but even after equalization, it was clear that this product is designed to deliver a lot of high frequency, decent midrange but little by way of bass - even though it claims to have frequency response going from 18Hz to 20kHz. It fits my ears properly, so that is not a problem. \n\nThis product sounds far inferior to a pair of "Aiwa" ear-buds that came with a "Made in Japan" walkman purchased in 1990!\n\nI wouldn\'t even compare the sound of these MX400 to the excellent Koss over the ear headphones I purchased recently.\n\nMaybe they are better than the IPOD headphones (which suck even worse), and the reason people give this 5 stars. Really - no more than a 2 star product.\n\nExpected much better from Sennheiser. With this experience, I\'ve decided not to go for their noise cancelling headphone and instead go with the one from Panasonic. Reputable companies should think twice before selling junk in the marketplace\n'

The picture is clear when it works.  The menus/programming are intuitive.  The pricing is reasonable.\n\nBut, my complaint is RELIABILITY and SUPPORT...for the two years I have had Dish my TV picture seems to go out every 6 months or so.  Everytime I talk to Dish customer service I get a different reason why it could be out.  Several times I have gotten new DVR boxes mailed to me and there is always a dispute about who should pay.  Several times I have had Dish Net come out to my house and they have always tried to make me pay until I told them I'm tired of the hassel and just cancel me.  Now my dish is out again this weekend and I am missing the Ohio State / Michigan game because my TV says no Dish Signal (reason tbd).\n\nAnyway, if it worked consistently as advertised I would give it 4 or 5 stars.  But due to reliability I give it 2 stars.  And with Murphy's Law it always goes down when you want to watch that big event (prompting me to write this review instead of watching the game today)!!

aS'\tBuyer Beware\n\tAll ports began running slow after just 6 months of use. Followed LinkSys RMA process and they sent me a hub in return by mistake. I followed yet another LinkSys RMA process and had to wait TWO MONTHS for the replacement switch covering their mistake. The replacement switch died after 1 week of use. The latest RMA unit ran excessively Hot until the smell of burning plastic left the air and then it would not power up. This is what I have learned about Linksys: #1) This should be a simple network pass-through device and it should not fail unless manufactured poorly - Linksys apparently cannot make a good one. #2) Do not even think about turning a broken unit into Linksys under their RMA process, they will simply send you a refurbished unit and it cannot be trusted. If these cheap switches fail they cannot be fixed and the original manufacture was flawed in the first place. #3) Choose a competitors product - I have had other brand switches running for years with no issues\n'

aS'\tGood sound... SUCKS for iPOD!!!\n\tThe ONLY reason i bought this unit when I saw it in the store was for the iPod controller feature.  I really looked forward to being able to control my iPod from the deck and hiding my ipod in my dash completely out of sight.  Boy was I disappointed!  The iPod adpater works and all... but barely.  It takes FOREVER to scroll through the songs, artists or albums.  Why the hell would Alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the iPod so you can\'t even select songs from the iPod itself?  I have over 3000 songs on my iPod... by the time I scroll to the song I want I\'ve already reached my destination... and that\'s if I even find the song at all!  So now what I have to do is unplug my iPod, scroll to the song I want, then plug it back in. (Luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your iPod in.)  But again... that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck.  Bottom line, the iPod control feature flat SUCKS.  The deck features a "quick search" function... but it is uselss... it isn\'t used to search through artsts or albums... only individual songs and there\'s no way to skip 10, 20, 30 or 100 songs at a time... only 1 by 1... What\'s "quick" about that?   I have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and Alpine thinks I\'m supposed to go through them 1 by 1???? Another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the iPod is playing, the display just says "song up" or "song down" instead of just showing the name of the damn song!  Who thought of that?  What possible help could "song up" be to anyone? Just show the name of the song while I\'m skipping through... that makes more sense right?  There are a bunch of other problems I have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the iPod adapter and iPod... but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing... but then again... who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to\n'
p142
aS'\tNot Good\n\tI bought an Alpine 9847 and the Ipod interface. I works but it totally hijacks your Ipod. The beautiful intuitve, fast controls on the Ipod itself are locked out and you can ONLY control the Ipod from the car stereo. It is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you Ipod. It is very slow, not at all intuitive. Even after getting used to it it is no good. The info on artist, album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly. Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list. Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever........Very annoying, very slow, very cumbersome. If only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the Ipod itself. A better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in, either stereo mini plug or RCA jacks. The just connect directly and use the IPods own controls which are infinitely better. I replace an old stereo to get the Ipod option and am very sorry I did so\n'

aS'\tA few problems\n\tI just purchased this product. In the instruction manual, it states that only the Brother AC adapter should be used and any other will invalidate the warranty. Why is it that only a Brother adapter can be used when AC adapters are supposed to be standard? A tactic to increase sales? The adapter itself costs an additional 15 to 20 dollars. In addition, I agree with some of the other reviewers that a significant amount of label is wasted with each printing due to the empty space on either side that must be cut off. The 2 line printing does look very nice. I have not used many of the other features and so cannot comment on those\n'

aS'\tDon\'t Buy Vtech - BATTERY ISSUES\n\tWe have bought 3 of these VTech Phones for our house. Since the begining we have had battery problems. It is really annoying when you have to make a phone call and your phone doesn\'t work because of the battery.\n\nAt any point in time, at least one of the phones constantly reports a "low charge" or "no battery" message, which means you can\'t use that phone. Of course, you can hear the ring from the phone that is never at the same room that you are, so you have to run to pick up the other phone, since the one in your location has the no battery problem.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, this in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time. \n\nOn the beginning we used to take the battery out of phone and put it back in. That doesn\'t quite work anymore. I tried to get support but you can\'t get a live person at the VTech number. On their website they suggest replacing the batteries, but they are rechargeable, so how many times are we really supposed to buy new rechargeable baterries (I have already replaced it once)?\n\nI know we wont buy VTech products again.\n'

aS'\tVery disappointing in numerous ways\n\tIt\'s not often I find a product that\'s as disappointing as this. The interference problem is very serious and makes most conversations a pain. Moving around the house and outside of the house, standing on your head holding the phone at a 45 angle, etc., are part of the daily ritual in trying to hold a legibible conversation.\n\nBut that\'s not the bad part. The bad part, as at least one other reviewer has noted, is that each of the phones constantly reports a  "low charge" message or something similar. This in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time. The only solution I\'ve found is to take the battery out of phone and put it back in. Then it will work for a day or two. I suppose it could be just the batteries. But if so then we were shipped batteries that were already on life-support.\n\nI read a few good reviews of this phone, and of course there are a number right here. But out experience has been the opposite. The phones have been nothing other than a pain\n'

aS'\tBeware\n\tI picked up this headset telephone because I am spending more and more time on the phone.  \n\nAlmost immediately after plugging it in, everyone I called asked me to speak up, repeat what I said, and that they could not hear me very well.  \n\nWhen I attempted to setup a new voicemail system, I found out why.  The headphone is amplified, but the microphone is not.  No matter how loud I spoke (or shouted) the audio is severely suppressed and barely audible.\n\nSimply stated, this product is not usable.\n'

aS'\tTargus PA400U DEFCON 1 Ultra Notebook Computer Security System\n\tI had this for approximately 2 years. It worked fine for couple of months but suddenely started to activate the alarm without any disturbances. One day I left my laptop attached the alarm in my office for about half an hour. During this period, the alarm was activated and I was embarrased to face my office workers. This is without increasing the sensitivity of the alarm. I sent it back to Targus and they were nice enough to give me a new alarm. But after several months, it started the same problem.\n So, now I am afraid to use this security system with my laptop. But I did not face problems like changing the combination by its own. You can use it without the alarm activation (i.e: without batteries) but the cable is so thin, it is not recommended to protect any valubles\n'

aS'\tPoor Macintosh Support\n\tI bought this item after seeing the almost uniformly good reviews including the one that says there is good Macintosh support.  Unfortunately the player does not work well with the Macintosh.  The included software often crashes and does not seem to be able to import DSS files.  The software can move the files between the recorder and the computer but the files do not appear in the software window.  The use interface is also fairly crude and looks as if it was ported directly from Windows 3.1.  The DS-2 appears to the finder as a standard USB disk and I have been able to copy the DSS files from the player to the compuer using the finder.  It is then possible to play the DSS files by double clicking them, but it will only play one file.  If you want to play another file it is necessary to completely quit the DSS player and relanch it.  Exporting the files to a format usable by other software such as AIFF is also nearly impossible.  There is an export function in the menu, when it is selected it asks were the new file should be saved but no file ever appears.  Unfortunately there is no other Macintosh software available to read or convert DSS files as Olympus refuses to allow others use the the format on the Macintosh.  Search of the internet reveals that others have found extremely painful ways of converting the DSS files such as playing the entire file and re-recording it with another program\n'

aS"\tPoor build quality\n\tGreat sound, but the build quality is just not there.  On a recent trip to Europe, the left bud completely fell apart and the leads became disconnected from the bass driver.  They are only two months old and I always keep them in the case!  I had to solder it back together and then super glue the bud back together.  Since then I've also had to superglue the right bud as well.  Also, the cable sheath is fraying over one bud lead, revealing the fine speaker wire underneath.  I don't expect these phones to last much longer which is too bad.  They are great sounding and comfortable, but unfortunately they seem to have cut some important corners.  Be warned\n"

aS'\tAweful Headphones!\n\tThese headphones are so expensive and they are aweful! I dont remember if it was the left or the right but one side of the cord is longer than the other; its very annoying! I tried to loosen it and the wire was showing, what a piece of s***. Its very annoying because the ear bud fell out when I listened to music and it doesnt feel comfortable. Also the rubber on the ear bud falls off very easily. They are too expensive for a piece of junk! The only reason I rate it two stars is because the sound is great on the headphones. Instead purchase the Sony SRF-HM01V S2 Sports Walkman Street Style Headphone Radio. I purchased those after these fell apart and they are much better :)\n'

aS"\tJust not good enough\n\tI SO wanted to love this thing. I have an iPod that I am seldom without, and my car isn't iPod compatible. I bought a Monster Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger so I could listen to my music on the way to my class reunion. Unfortunately, the thing just didn't work for me. \n\nThere are 8 preset stations (low on the dial) and if all of them are in use, you're out of luck. I don't live in a huge city (maybe 60,000 with farmland all around), but only two of these stations were available. Although I was able to tune in to my iPod, it wasn't crystal clear. In fact, it wasn't even plastic clear. The static sometimes overrode the music, which drove me nuts. This is like a fax machine - the original may be spotless, but the fax will be a little fuzzy. \n\nIf you have a cassette player in your car, there are adapters that go through the cassette player and are much better. If your car isn't iPod compatible and you don't have a cassette player, you're better off just burning a bunch of CD's\n"

There\'s always exceptions to rules, and the rule, "the more you pay, the more you get" is the exception to the rule for this web camera. After getting it, I had difficulty in getting the software to load but eventually had success. I was very disappointed in the video quality. There seemed to be a lot of noise in the picture, and tweaking gave no improvement. I returned it to Amazon and took a lose in the return shipping cost, but considered it worth it just to get the price of the camera back. Amazon lived up to their part and refunded the price paid (less return shipment) with no hassle\n'

aS'\tNo security  and  difficult to use\n\tNot a particularly easy lock to use (combo part rotates freely when not in computer, making it difficult to set the combo). Also changing combo is very easy to do accidently. However this is usually not a problem because it is incredibly easy to figure out the combo. I am not a professional lock picker, and I am able to break the combo without any difficulty (which is a problem with many low quality combo locks, but this design try to avoid it at all). \nI\'ve noticed a lot of people have a problem with the lock "spontaneously" changing combinations. It\'s probably not because the lock  is defective. It\'s probably because they inadvertently changed the combination because the mechanism to change it is so easy to engage.\nI would definitely never suggest this product to anyone (unless I really wanted their computer)\n'

aS"\tDisparate cord length- more than irritating.\n\tI read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport AND low ambient sound i-pod headpohones without breaking the bank (I'm on a plane frequently). I wanted something that I wouldn't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels. I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug (like maybe at your desk at work). The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still. So then I thought these will be great workout headphones (won't be upset if I break or lose them), HOWEVER, the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand. The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience (even when you are sitting stationary at your desk). It is similar to wearing a stethescope, which defeats the point of wearing in-the-ear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise). I do not recommend these headphones, because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses (they are after all designed to wear behind the head). I'm on the hunt for better quality headphones\n"

aS"\tNot working as well as I'd like\n\tI like this style of headphone radio (especially when I jog), and haven't found any similar models that I like. This is my third purchase of this radio.  Each of the three have had problems.  First died completely (although it was used a lot).  Second still works, but last number doesn't show up on digital display.  I wanted a backup in case second died, so I ordered another one.  This third works least well of all.  At times, entire display is off, radio doesn't work at all, or it won't change channels.  Then other times it worked. Seems like might be affected by heat outside. However, I know have another persistent problem.  That being, it won't let me program the preset stations.  Again, I'm limited in my choices, and I use this type headphone a lot.  So I suffer through poor quality\n"

aS"\tGreat Sound.  But lacking in other areas.\n\tIsolation:\nI had to use the foam inserts because the plastic ones were a little too large for my ears. With the foam, it completely sealed my ear canal and blocked out most noise.  My commute home on the J train (light-rail) was quite silent.  I was listening to classical music for the first time on the train.  With earbuds, I had to put the volume level around 50%.  With the Sony MDR-EX71 model, I could to keep it around 40%.  The noise attenuation wasn't that good with the Sony model, but definitely better than earbuds (but the sound quality was quite terrible though.)\n\n\nSound Quality:\nSuperb sound.  The partnership with Etymotic Research is evident.  Everything sounded great:  rock, grunge, classical.  The Sonys sounded really muddy while these had a really bright sound with good bass (when the seal was good).  Very balanced sound.\n\nCord/Construction:\nI string my earphones through an REI One jacket, so this was more or less perfect length.  The cord is symmetric so it's not weirdly strung behind your neck like the Sonys, and the connection to the ear pieces is solid, not fragile-looking like the ER6.  The earphones connect to the replaceable eartips very tightly.  The included case is ridiculous though; it's way too bulky for portability.\n\nComfort/Fit:\nSadly, this is primary reason I'm returning these.  Both the flanged rubber tips and the included foam tips were too big.  The foam models got the seal, but they were too big, so I felt an uncomfortable amount of pressure in my ear canals.  Those were my only two options with the included package.  The other problem is that I cannot find replacements that are smaller, anywhere on the web, including the Altec Lansing site.\n\nDocumentation:\nAnother reason I am returning these is the documentation.  The manual says that I can get replacement ear tips and accessories at alteclansing.com/inmotionearphones, and I get a 404 error when I visit the link.  That is pretty pathetic.\n\nUpdate:  (1/19/2006)I emailed Altec Lansing regarding this issue on 1/10/2006, and I have yet to get a response from them.\n\nBottom Line:\nIf you have large ears, these may suit you.  But if you know that you have smaller ears, then stay away from these, and go for something else\n"

aS'\tPoor reproduction\n\tI bought these to replace the standard iPod and Sony ear buds.  I was under the impression that I would get a much deeper bass response.  I was wrong.  The bass reproduction is simply horrid.  I read somewhere there is a "break-in" period.  I have found this not to be true.  They sound just as bad after 50 hours of listening as they did brand new.  This is my first pair of Sennheiser and am very disappointed.  I know they are low-end headphones - but I expected more.  My recommendation is to keep researching\n'

aS"\tMy PC is now dead, and Netgear doesn't care\n\tDuring the installation of the software on my PC running Windows 2000 Server, the installation program froze my PC completely. I had to turn off the PC, and now it does nothing when I turn it on. The lights on the front light up, but nothing happens at all. I called Netgear, waited on hold for 15 minutes, and then was connected to a gentleman whose English was not very good. I explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it. He told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with Win 2000 Server. I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro, but not 2000 Server (perhaps there are some), but he insisted that this was the case. I explained that, typically, installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user, and exit, rather than freezing and disabling the computer, but he held firm, and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help, and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration. \n\nI went around and around with this fellow, then finally asked for his supervisor. After another 15 minutes on hold, another guy came on the line, who was pretty fluent in English. He explained his understanding of the situation, which was still wrong, and I explained the whole thing again to him. He had me turn the computer on and off, which of course I had already done several times, and check the monitor connection. After this analysis, he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it, and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly, that, coincidently, occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze. I expressed skepticism towards this explanation, and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC. He said that absolutely he would, and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY, (emphasis his) that his software could have caused these symptoms. \n\nSince I understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone, I suggested that I could take it to a local technician, and send Netgear the bill for repairing my system. He declined that offer.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, I'm left with a dead PC, but, according to Netgear, a perfectly good wireless card and installation CD. \n\nNo more Netgear for me, thank you!\n"

aS"\tWhy, oh why, didn't I check Amazon reviews first?\n\tI am totally stunned that this could be sold as iPOD compatible.  Nothing, absolutely nothing, works as you would intuitively think it would.  Pause does not pause, forward arrow does not forward to the next track (just starts the same track over and over again), and heaven help you if you actually want to find a specific song or artist.  There is no way to actually speed through a menu - you have to advance one artist at a time.  This is fine if you love Aaron Neville but chances are you will be in a limb severing accident if you are trying to get to ZZ Top.  I am taking this back tomorrow and demanding something that will allow me to control my iPod again from my iPod\n"

aS'\tIt is what it is\n\tI guess for $50, this is an ok product.  I am usually very against monster products, but I\'d seen this for almost double at big box retailers, needed a surge protector for my new DLP tv, so figured what the heck.  It arrived without incident, I hooked it up and so far so good.  It basically a power strip with labels that also happens to be purple... for the "neato" effect I guess.  Anyways, no idea if its worth more than your run of the mill surge protector.  But the claims of independent circuitry to minimize cross-interference is what I was really interested in, as I have my reciever, cable box, DVD player, and subwoofer all connected...  All in all a good buy I guess, at least you paid a lot less than retail... :\n'

aS'\tSix months and no Thinkpad tip? Completely unsatisfactory!\n\tI bought one of these a few months ago. It worked perfectly with my old Thinkpad, but not long thereafter I got a Thinkpad T60, thinking, "Hey, universal means universal, of course it will work". But no: SIX MONTHS after the T60 was introduced, Kensington STILL hasn\'t gotten their act together to produce a "SmartTip" for it. They haven\'t even added Lenovo to the list of manufacturers on their web site! All Customer Service can say is that they don\'t have one, they don\'t know when or if they ever will, and they suggest that I check back on the website someday if I still hold out any hope. So, I have a $100 brick on my hands. Very disappointing, Kensington.\n\nIt\'s really too bad: the unit is lightweight, sleek, and functional, and (unlike some reviewrs) I think the 5-inch cord was brilliant (and it doesn\'t get tangled up in my briefcase). The cables are much nicer than on my 70-watt iGo supply, and the connectors don\'t break like they did on the iGo. And it\'s not like there\'s some technical problem: the T60 needs 20 volts, 90 watts, well within the 24-volt, 120-watt capability of this unit.  However, six months delay in supporting a major business computer brand is just unforgivable, so I can no longer recommend it\n'

aS"\tA Big Disappointment\n\tI was excited about consolidating 3 remote controls I regularly use plus my fan and light controls.  However, the Harmony 890 has proved to be a big disappointment.  I was much better off with the 3 remotes I was using before.  It was much simpler than fooling with the Harmony remote which requires so many key presses for basic functions.  I never have been able to get the Harmony to control the fan and lights.\n\nSome reviewers have said that you just need to take time to do the programming properly.  Even if you do, in my case it's just easier to juggle my 3 remotes and press ONE button to do what it would take with SEVERAL key presses on the Harmony.\n\nMy Harmony is now going to sit with the other remotes I never use and I'll just stick to the 3 that work for me\n"

It appears that there is a chip in the drive housing manufactured by Cypress that is failing in drives left and right. (Class action suit anyone?)\n\nThe Western Digital support staff is no help. Act like they have never heard of this error. Offer no option to just switch out the housing. Will replace drive- but you lose all the data.

aS'\tA lot lacking for this kind of money\n\tWhile convenient and a nice, lightweight unit, the voice pickup is very poor, regardless of how you adjust the set.  This is not only with the set I have used, but with others I have talked to - you can tell if the person on the other end of the phone is using one of these units because they are so faint.  I\'ve gotten so I just ask if they\'re using a Plantronics CS50 when they are faint and the answer is invariably "yes".  Also, if you are in a building with a lot of exposed metal (window/door frames, high cubicles with lots of metal), the range deteriorates significantly\n'

aS"\tAgain, Monster has to be kidding (and they are)\n\tFor some years I tried this and other Monster products, to the tune of over $1000 in Monster a/v gear. The more you learn about video and audio, the more you'll avoid anything with the Monster label. Specifically, this s-video meets no NTSC, DVD or IEEE standard; it is common 30-ohm hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed, low-conductance connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding. Has a sharp image, but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from off-color skin tones to color blotching, dirty grays, burned highlights, murky shadows, noisy reds, and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds. Makes video test patterns look great, but who watches test patterns all day? Amazon offers many other brands at good prices, why waste your $$ on this stuff? I removed every piece of Monster from my system and replaced them with AR, Belden, Viewsonics and others from Amazon. Result: vast improvement in every respect.\n"

aS'\tLousy Customer Support and Windows XP surprise changes...\n\tI bought this adapter along with the Linksys WRT54GL Broadband Router.  I managed to set them up and install them properly.  (The best advice I got from the "Home Networking for Dummies" book was to get a 100 foot Cat5e patch cable so that I could put my router in the place I where I wanted it, and hook it up with a wired connection first.  I actually only needed a 50 foot cable, and got it for $20 from a local electronics supply store.)\n\nSo I got everything up and running (remember to install your router first, and then your network adapter), surfed the internet for awhile, and then shut down my computer.  Here\'s where the trouble started....\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the Linksys installation makes changes to your Windows XP configuration, de-activating the Welcome screen and the feature Microsoft calls "Fast User Switching."  This happens with no warning.\n\nWhen I went to turn on my computer again, I got a new start-up screen for Windows, demanding a password.  I freaked out, because I don\'t remember ever setting a password for Windows.  I called Linksys, and was extremely unimpressed with their customer support.  The young woman seemed to be amused by my problem, and was actually laughing at me.  She began to start me through the process of completely re-setting the router to the factory settings (this would NOT have helped).\n\nWhat finally helped was figuring out (with no help from Linksys) that if you never set a password for your Windows XP logon, all you have to do is hit "Enter" at the password prompt.  That\'s all there is.  Linksys could have told me this, or better yet, warned before installation that these changes to Windows XP would take place and suggest setting up a User Password in advance.\n\nAnother gripe about this network adapter and the Linksys router--neither came with instruction manuals.  There is a 60-page instruction manual on the CD rom that comes with the product, but you\'ll have to print it out yourself (Do it before you install or try installing the product).  In the case of the router, I also had to do deep searching to actually find the instruction manual on the CD-ROM--it wanted to start up the Setup Wizard automatically and the instruction manual was not easy to access from the CD-ROM.  I guess this may be the norm now with computer hardware, but it still stinks.\n\nI do not recommend the Linksys WUSB54GC, primarily because of the unannounced changes it makes to the Windows XP system, and because of Linksys\' non-existent or non-functional and rude customer support\n'

aS"\tNot worth it\n\tI have owned the TomTom Navigator 5 for almost a year now.  While the program is well thought out and provides a good function, it does not work well with my Tungsten T5.  I have contacted customer service 4 times now and they have always been helpful in trying to fix my issues (listed below), but to no avail.  \n\nSome of the issues I have had:\n\nAny time the software has to redirect or think, it locks up.  If I stay on the original planned route, it sometimes works properly...\n\nIn a 30 minute trip from Orange County to Long Beach, I had to pull over 7 times to reset my device after the software locked up.\n\nVoices lock up mid sentence giving a stuttering sound until you are able to pull your car over to reset the device.\n\nIn a 20 minute trip from San Francisco to Oakland the device locked up 5 times.  I finally gave up and called a friend to guide me.\n\nBear in mind, I have had no problems with my T5 in the 1.5 years of ownership...it is only with this software.  Customer service has acknowledged the problems and given solutions that have solved little to nothing.  \n\nIn summary, it's not worth spending the money to have to print out Mapquest directions to have when the device crashes...stick with Mapquest\n"
p191
aS"\tOkay product. Contemptuous product support.\n\tEssentially once TomTom has your money they're finished with you . . . until you want to spend more money with them.\n\n  The product is okay. The map data is from TeleAtlas, a vendor to many of the map software producers. What makes TomTom different is its GUI (Graphic User Interface) that the user interacts with. It really is a work of art most of the time. The map presentations are rich and may be viewed as 3D or 2D. The planning interface is icon driven and easy-to-use. Unfortunately TomTom really didn't think it all the way through.\n\n  There are several irritants, all of which vie for first place. One is that TomTom doesn't give you the option of using its maps without a GPS. There are many instances where I know where I am begining from and going to and I don't need a GPS fix. TomTom ignores such desires and annoyingly keeps prompting for you to start your Bluetooth connection. There is one mode that you can use to plan a route without a GPS and it simply doesn't work very well, often informing you that TomTom can't route you from a point beginning on an interstate to another point further along the same highway. That's just plain dumb. This is a mapping application. If I want to use these expensive maps for walking directions without a GPS, I should be able to. TomTom certainly doesn't think so.\n\n  Another irritant is the documentation. Probably in an effort to make TomTom appealing to the casual user, the documentation is dog simple . . . and often wrong. It appears that they didn't update the documentation to the newest version.\n\n  Although you can load maps by region, TomTom makes no allowance for travelling from one region to another. You have to calculate your route to the ending point within one region and then begin it anew in the next region. Again, this strikes me as a silly omission. If you are in Wisconsin, which is one region, and drive to Minnesota, which is in another, you have to create two routes. Not bright.\n\n  There are a number of idiosyncracies, anomalies and bugs that drive me up a wall. However, overall, TomTom is still better than the competition. It computes routes quickly (when it is capable of figuring a route at all). Annoying, however, it tends to prefer expressways, regardless of your preferences. In a major metro area laced with expressways going in all directions, this can create some incredibly convoluted - and ridiculous - routes. Creating alternative and more logical routes is possible, but tedious.\n\n  The worst part of the TomTom experience is its customer support. Well, perhaps support is the wrong word for it. I encountered two problems installing the software. It was obviously that the tech support person was clueless and was simply guessing and grasping at straws. (I had resolved the issues before the rep called and already knew what the problem was.) The TomTom rep didn't listen, kept interrupting and when it was pointed out that he was contradicting the manual, he just kept moving. (The manual in at least one instance was correct and the rep wrong.)\n\n  The TomTom packaging itself arrived in broken condition. The rep denied it was their packaging, claiming that I must have bought a third-party repackaged product. Talk about insulting: I have the package in front of me with the TomTom labels, the whole works and this guy is telling me that my lying eyes are deceiving me?\n\n  A fax to TomTom management about my experiences has gone unanswered more than a week later.\n\n  TomTom is riding high right now but I suspect in a couple of years as competitors introduce better products with better support that TomTom will be history. It won't be the first company that offered a good-enough product without support and possesing contempt for its customers to disappear and it won't be the last.\n\n  I know that if I find a marginally better product with adequate support, I'd abandon TomTom in a flash.\n\nJerr\n"

aS"\tMap Activation? For a product I purchased?\n\tThe TomTom Navigator is a nice enough device, until you get to the Maps activation. The Maps activation? Why should I have to activate my maps if I have paid for the product? Good question, well, I activated these maps on one PDA, and within 2 weeks my PDA died and I had to obtain warranty service. Well, I decided that I would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when I got it back from the manufacturers (I tend to switch my PDA every 3-4 months anyway).\n\nSo I installed the maps on the new device and it asked me to activate. OK, I figure...no problem, I will be able to activate it 1...2...3 because after all, only I have the activation card/code. No such luck, TomTom wants PROOF that I have brought a new device? what kind of nonsense is that? What if I lost my PDA in 2-3 months? What if I'm a nut who likes to change PDA's every 3-4 months? What, you mean I have to show you proof that I switched? Isn't the fact that I have the activation card proof enough? I don't know too many people who pay $269 for a product and let other people use the activation codes.\n\nAvoid them at all costs. You will regret your purchase if you change devices frequently.\n\nOne other problem with this product...out of the box it is not 100% compatible with Windows Mobile 5 devices (most of the new Axims are WM5. You really have to break your back to install on these devices.\n\nAvoid\n"

aS"\tBarely gets the job done ...\n\tMy company car has a built-in GPS unit and I have gotten to like it, sort-of.  I have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around Silicon Valley enough to get a portable GPS unit.  After some research, the Garmin iQue 3600 is what I ended up with and I paid about $700.  The unique feature of this portable GPS unit is that a PalmPilot comes integrated into the package.   I use a PalmPilot, so this GPS unit replaces my PalmV.    Installation was quite awkward, and getting it up and running was a chore.   I got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now.  It does do the job, fitfully, and has several glaring issues.  Most irritating, the Palm function and the GPS function are not seamlessly integrated.  If an address is entered in the Palm part and then route to this address is selected, the iQue 3600 makes you find the location.  But the address from the Palm section doesn't transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address.  I'm left-handed and graffiti has NEVER worked for me all my letters are drawn backward.  The GPS can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go, but my unit takes a good 5-10 minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky.   This means that I must have a good idea what to do for the first 5-10 minutes.  Sometimes I just drive randomly until the GPS locks in and starts to issue navigation orders.  Also, the antenna must be deployed to get any GPS reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky.  This is OK, except that the iQue 3600 doesn't tell you that the antenna has not been deployed.  \n   The iQue 3600 does not work propped up on the passenger seat so a 5 pound holder is necessary to hold the unit on the dashboard.  If the antenna is not deployed, the iQue 3600 simply doesn't navigate and doesn't tell you why.  Worse, it acts stupid by going into a dangerous and unhelpful simulate mode.  If I ever figure out what that means, Ill tell you in a future post.  I figured out the antenna problem the hard way in an ice storm outside of Ottawa.  I'm a fan of GUI design, and I must say that the UI here is very, very bad.  Not the worse I have ever seen, but very bad:  non-intuitive, inconsistent, and arbitrary.  The FIND function/button has an entirely different function in the GPS section from the Palm section.  Of course, the same icon is used.  I cannot imagine grandma using this thing to navigate.  What little there is of the very pretty documentation is atrocious.  About 10 times more information is needed here.  It shuts down randomly on occasion for no apparent purpose (Battery savings maybe?).\n   The secure digital card is too small (max of 256MB), so you can't put more than a few California counties in the memory.  Maps storage is managed with a rather hostile GUI.  This is not fatal, but is irritating.  I would rather put a 1GB SD card in the iQue 3600 and be done with it.\n   The iQue 3600 burns too much power to be used as a portable, so it must always be tethered to the car or resting in the cradle.  I don't find the power issue to be a problem.  I understand that to get clear, bright screens it is necessary to use power.  I agree with the tradeoff here.\n"

Quite a few of them were broke when I got them.  Even the ones that weren't broke are made of VERY flimsy plastic and I have a feeling they will break if I open them very often.

I went home, installed the software and plugged everything in. I printed off a few things and it looked great. Today, I went to use the printer again and the power woudn't turn on! I disconnected then reconnected everything and still no power! I tried several more things and still couldn't turn the power on. Now I have to return it to BestBuy. This was the first and last time I will ever buy anything from HP!!\n"

aS"\tFive Stars for the Buds, Zero Stars for the Cord\n\tI do not recommend Sennheiser's MX75 headphones.\n\nFirst, the good features:\n1. As with all Sennheiser products, these earphones deliver first rate sound for its price range.\n2. The earphones are very comfortable and easy to fit properly using the included pads.\n3. Once inserted in the ear, these earphones will not fall out due to vibration, movement or sweating.\n\nHowever, the cord has ugly problems:\n1. The cord is unusually stiff and consequently tends to be tough to manage. This is especially true when the phones are first removed from the package, as the cord maintains a sort of corkscrew shape for quite some time.\n2. The cord running to the right earphone is substantially longer than the one connecting to the left earphone. The result is annoying slack around the face and neck.\n3. The cord is the ugliest possible shade of green.\n\nAll in all, should Sennheiser offer a new product using the same earphones, but with conventional wiring, I'll be a buyer. Until then, I've given up on using these lime green annoyances\n"

aS"\tWouldn't work for me - soooo disappointed\n\tI bought this TV for my husband to take hunting but we can't get very many channels and the ones we do get have a terrible picture.   The TV is an awesome size and the design is really nice with a good size screen.  I didn't hook to cable so that may improve the picture but we don't have cable.  I tried programming the channels from two different locations 20 miles apart from each other.  I tried programming with the antenna on the TV and with separate rabbit ears.   It would only pick up one of the three local network stations.  It picked up maybe 8 other misc stations which aren't popular.   I couldn't get a good picture on any of the stations and I tried adjusting all the menu items, brightness, hue, etc.  It didn't even have a good black and white picture .... it was like a white screen with blurry images in the back.   Sooooo, sooo disappointed because I wanted to be able to use this at work too.\n"

Those users who enjoy the backlight of a Mac PowerBook or MacBook Pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach Saitek used to illuminate the keys, though. On the Mac, each key has its own embedded light under the key. On the Saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard, reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys.  But it's better than nothing, and is helpful in low light. It would have also been nice if they had an Fn key, but such is life\n"

It won't load in as it's supposed to but will fit correctly backwards.  Except then I get an amber light that says there is a card error.  This is supposed to work with my all-in-one but it doesn't.  For that reason, I'd give it a zero star rating if such a rating existed.  I'm going to take this CP version back and hope the more updated CPF version works.  I'm a travel writer planning to take my own photos to go with my articles, but I'm getting nowhere fast with this card adapter that refuses to work properly.  This one is definitely a thumbs down.

Customer service from this company is also very poor. If I had it to do over I would not have purchased this product and I probably should not have spent the money to get it fixed.

aS"\tNot for a serious Audiophile setup\n\tDissapointing. The sping-loaded connectors at the back of the selector are not particularly strong, so thick or rigid cables under tension (e.g. twisted at odd angles) easily slip out.

Connections might be better using Monster Cables' own Angled Gold Pin connectors, but I didn't try those\n"

aS'\tDon\'t buy this junk.  Plenty of other good adapters, why risk buying this\n\tMine actually works and I still hate it.\n\nI haven\'t had all the problems others are complaining about.\n---I run Windows XP SP2 had no problems compatability.\n---Signal strength is fine.\n---I had no problem installing on one computer....except that I installed the card before running the CD, just like every other card or peripheral I have ever installed.  I\'ve never seen one that didn\'t allow you to install hardware before drivers.  So I had to take it out, run CD and put back in.  Just a minor annoyance that cost 10 minutes.  But c\'mon Linksys why the special order?  Most people that are willing to open the computer and install a card don\'t need instructions to know "take card and put in slot" and "insert disc", so they don\'t look at them.  At least they put a warning sticker about the installation order on the disk cover for us non-direction readers.  Annoying but no stars deducted for this.\n---Told Mom to buy one (this was before I had installed mine). Installed easy and it worked fine at first.  Now it connects to router but can\'t find internet (yes other computers connect to net through this router just fine).  Would think maybe firewall setting issue??? but I used to work then just stopped.  C\'mon Linksys if your connected to the router how hard it is to find the internet.  Deduct 1 star.\n---Stupid software only supports hexidecimal passwords.  Of course my router also support standard alphabet and my password had some G-Z letters, so I had go change network password and update all devices attached to the network.  C\'mon Linksys how hard it is to support A-Z. Annoying but no stars deducted.\n---SLOW SLOW SLOW SLOW TO CONNECT!!!!  On my other computers you hit connect and are online in 5-10 seconds.  This thing takes 30 seconds to a minute. Impatient, yes.  But still unacceptable.  Deduct 1 star.\n---Can\'t hibernate or sleep computer or card disables.  Only way to get it turned on again is to reboot.  So it\'s either leave computer on all day long, or reboot everytime I want go online.  Deduct 1 stars.\n--Overall bad product.  Deduct one star\n'

Oh boy was I wrong.\n\nEven the though I get full bars with these cards, I get very flaky connections with them. I've tried many different settings and firmwares to try to rectify the problem. Many hours have been spent trying to get a stable connection. No dice, very flaky.\n\nOther computers with different cards work fine with the wrt54gs and never dropout. So there is something about this card that just isn't right, and I can't imagine both cards being defective.

Also, probably the biggest failure in my opinion is that they appear to be line of sight - that is, they fade in and out when you walk around the room.  This should not be a problem on this low bandwidth (but it is), perhaps the antenna needs a boost\n"

aS"\tCheap junk\n\tCheap piece of junk. Probably has 2 cents of electronic parts in it. I'm returning it to Wallmart. It might work OK if you live like right next door to the broadcast transmitter. Otherwise it's just too weak in its signal pulling ability. Also, when I turn the gain dials, they don't seem like they are really variable. I think they are really just on/off switches disguised as variable dials, because i don't see any difference between medium gain and high gain on any of the channels. I'm going to now go to a REAL, serious electronics store and look for some SERIOUS tv electronics hardware instead of Wallmart garbage. I'm going to work on improving my roof antenna and its cabling and I'm going to try using a variable gain preamp if I can find one (a high quality one, not junk). I tried a preamp from Wallmart (which wasn't adjustable at all) and it did help a lot with UHF channels, but the VHF channels were much worse because it made the signal too strong. So I need a variable gain preamp, assuming there is such a thing. I would advise everyone to go read the information available on the internet about tv antennas and how to get the best picture with them. I did yesterday and there's a lot of good stuff I never knew before.\n"

aS'\tTerrible, useless, and unecessarily complicated.\n\tAll I wanted was something to make the incoming audio louder while listening to a call and typing during an interview. I couldn\'t find just a headset amp so I purchased this "system" based on Plantronics\' good name. \n\nInstead of just plugging it into the wall phone jack, you have to use a regular phone, route the receiver/handset cord to this, then back out to the receiver/handset again, which makes this light unit basically hamstrung between the headset and handset and doesn\'t want to sit on the desk without taping it down. Then you have to take the receiver/handset off the hook, place it on the desk (assuming you have desk space, which I don\'t) then push a button to start up the headset. \n\nMost importantly, listening sound quality was muffled and not very loud. If I turned up the incoming sound volume, it immediately put a loud annoying squeal of feedback into the microphone, making it totally unusable. \n\nI went back to my regular, unampflied Plantronics headset which just plugs into the wall phone and is always on with no extra cords, ac adapter, or buttons to push. I\'m not very thrilled with that, but for $15 it sounds MUCH better and much louder, without the feedback or the hassles. So for now I guess I\'ll stick with that until I find something else that just improves the incoming sound\n'

After fiddling around with it for a few hours I finally got the contraption working again.\n\nBut, now my latest problem is that the print server prints garbage to the printer! Plugging the printer directly in to a computer works fine, but the print service somehow corrupts the data going to the printer and I end up with pages of garbage and error messages.\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis thing was a beast to set-up and every time something goes wrong, it takes a phenomenal amount of time to debug and correct. That's in addition to the questionable reliability of this device. I say steer clear of this thing. I'm now shopping for something better and never buying D-Link again\n"

I have to be within 10 feet of my router to get a 50% signal (even though I can walk out tot he edge of my house and easily still get a good connection). If it does detect Bluetooth, which half the time it doesn't (regardless of it being active), it cancels out the wifi detection. So if you have a bluetooth headset, and you're talking, the thing will just let you know that yes, there is a bluetooth device around. Thanks. I was wondering\n"

However - my first one lasted 3 months before it died, I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well.

aS"\tTotal crap.  Sound quality is AWFUL.\n\tI returned this thing the day after I bought it.  \n\nI should of been clued in when I purchased it at the store, ALL the Transpod models had a little sticker on them advising them about the store's return policy.  I thought it a little unusual at the time, but after listening to the thing I understand why now.  I'm sure a lot of people had been returning this model.\n\nThe sound quality was really bad.  You have to turn your stereo WAY up to hear the music, and even then it sounds almost as bad as AM radio.  I'll add that the files I was playing were 192Kbps aac encoded files so they're decent quality too\n"

aS"\tFancy features, but bottom line...poor performance\n\tWhile a nice product packed with great features when it works, the bottom line is that it does NOT support TWAIN drivers, meaning you can not scan through ANY application other than ScanSnap.

I even tried using high grade color laser copier paper, but STILL double feeds big time! Upon occasion, I get a good feed, and I am so thankful for that. \nIf you are planning to do some serious office organizing with various types of paper, sizes and paper weights, skip this product and go for a ADF flatbed scanner. This baby will JAM up your day and consume all of your time with fiddling, reorganizing the misfeeds and clearing jams.\nThink deeply before buying this one. Also, with an ADF flatbed, you can scan books, and unusual documents (thin paper, very heavy paper) that an ADF (and the ScanSnap) won't process by simply lifting the lid of the ADF and taking the scan directly on the glass.

It doesn't give much air and all the air you get you need to be close to feel... plus its too loud to use in most places...\n\nIf you really need it, you can get it... but I can't use mine often because like I said its too loud.

aS"\tTerrible and disappointing product\n\tThe battery life for this phone after one short year is abysmal.  After charging it all night, it dies after a few hours of nonuse.\nThe redial button simply has never worked. \nIt is not user friendly at all although I could live with this if the two issues above were resolved.   \nI contacted AT and T and requested that they send me a new model that works since this phone is obviously defective.  \nIf they refuse then I won't ever buy an AT and T product again and neither will anyone I come into contact with.  \nIt's that simple. \n\nUpdate...AT and T refused to do anything about the phone despite the obvious flaws,.  As a result, I will never buy another AT and T product again.\nAT and T, you are exhibiting the traits of a company that will go out of business.\n"
p240
aS"\tWorst Phones I have ever used\n\tWe bought a set of these phones because they looked nice, and because AT and T is a reliable company. But these phones are the worst. After having them for about 3 weeks, we began having terrible results with the volume/speakers in the phones. I took them back, and got a new set. These lasted about twice as long, before the battery life just became worthless. We are unable to leave these phones off the hook now for any extended period of time - say, 1 hour. And you can't talk on the phone for more than 30 minutes or so before the battery dies out, and takes 6 hours or more to get back charged again. And yes, we followed all the directions for letting the batteries charge, and all that kind of stuff. Still...I have never used a more frustrating phone, nor will I ever purchase an AT and T phone again. I bought a new phone today, and once fully charged, I will take these AT and T phones out back and smash them with a hammer\n"

aS"\tPathetic sound.\n\tI also was suckered in by the Monster name. I have an older Sony adapter that I've used in the past with no problems but couldn't locate it right before a road-trip, so I bought this one also. This actually sounds substantially worse than my actual cassettes (even though they're all over 10 years old).\nThe sound is hiss-filled, very poor signal-to-noise ratio.\nStay well away\n"
p242
aS'\tZero Stars\n\tI attempted to use this product in my 2002 Chevy Tahoe factory audio system. As others here noted, the deck would quickly error and eject the Monster Adapter. The Monster Adapter did work in my 2000 Harley Davidson FLTRI factory audio system. The difference is that the Harley unit does not have "cut-tape" detection. The Tahoe does. \n\nI returned this Monster unit and picked up the Sony Sony CPA-9C. \n\nThe Sony device is a bit different as it has small link of simulated audio tape within the tape path. This little bit of simulated audio tape effectively fools the tape unit not to think that there is an error and eject the Cassette Adapter. There are other reasons that these adapters will auto-eject (Google is your friend). But the Sony unit seemed to be the solution for me. \n\nThe big reason for the zero star review is that Monster has ZERO information on their web site or product packaging regarding device compatibility or troubleshooting.\n'

aS"\tThe worst unit I have ever used\n\tI bought this unit a couple of years ago based on its features, but soon discovered that it can't normally do the one thing that all GPSs should, tell you where you are.  I used my e-Trex Vista for about a year and half and would estimate that I spent 10% to 15% of the time staring at some type of lost signal message.  The unit is totally useless under any type of tree cover and often has trouble holding a signal anywhere on overcast days, which means about half the time in the Seattle area where I live.  I would not recommend this unit to anyone but my worst enemy\n"
p244
aS'\tLackluster product at best\n\tI had this GPS device for only 3 days and found it to be no better than mediocre.\n\nAlthough at one point I was able to track 6 WAAS satellites and the display claimed accuracy to 17 feet, while driving along a straight road for 5.5 miles, it indicated that I was traveling approximately 350 feet to the side of the road.  On two occasions on this straight road, it said I actually crossed the road and traveled on the opposite side.\n\nI conducted a test by placing the unit where it would have an unobstructed view of the sky for 1 hour and leave it motionless.  The trip computer reported that it had moved nearly a quarter-mile during that hour.  I checked the accuracy at 15-minute intervals and it was constantly reporting accuracy between 12-24 feet.\n\nThe base maps are crude and inaccurate - a major 4-lane road (Hwy 7) in Tacoma, WA stops at 38th street.  Really?!?  If I drive down Hwy 7, it goes a couple of miles farther than the unit shows.\n\nWhile using the compass you must hold the unit level in order to obtain accurate readings - understandable.  There is even a little message that tells you to hold it level if you are off a little - nice.  I tried and tried to find "level" according to the unit and after about 3 or 4 minutes was able to determine where "level" was.  It was nowhere close to actual level.  Now, if I am trying to navigate with the unit\'s compass while it is mounted to my bike, there is no way it is going to be level and accurate.\n\nAt 5.3 ounces, it doesn\'t even pass off as a good paperweight.\n\nFortunately I was able to return it to the seller with no problems for a full refund (Thank you REI!).  I found out that Wal-Mart.com sells the unit for 50 bucks less than REI after I bought it though.\n\nRecommendation:  If you need a paperweight, get a rock - if you need a GPS, get a different one.\n'

aS"\tGood device, worst service and software imaginable\n\tGarmin's devices are pretty good. Somewhat tempermental, but mostly reliable. It's connecting their software and dealing with Garmin support that is a nightmare. And, you will need to call them because their software has all kinds of bugs and an archaic key system. Customer service hold time: 30-35 minues. Response time for  email tech requests: a staggering 5-7 working days. Clearly Garmin does not care about its customers\n"

aS"\tGreat Product - Horrible Durability\n\tWhen these headphones are working, they are great. I never have trouble receiving sound. They are amazingly comfortable. Great battery life, and batteries are rechargeable. Long distance is great too, I can walk throughout the whole house on multiple floors without any trouble.\n\nBut... it's FAR to often that these are NOT working. As a matter of fact I've gone through FOUR pair in the last 2 years. The first pair didn't work out of the box. The second pair lasted two weeks and then the headset just would not turn on. The third pair lasted about eight months before the same thing happened, they just would not turn on. The forth pair lasted about a year and then yesterday the very same thing happened.\n"

aS'\tSoftware defeats purpose of flash drives.\n\tAfter having an experience with slow startup speeds (and actually freezing a computer) with the 1GB Cruzer Micro with U3, I feel compelled to write this negative review. The mere existence of a software layer to access the flash drive defeats the main purpose of existence of flash drives: a fast and higlhly compatible interface. Any hidrance to this convenience makes the device a liability. I work at an educational institution wher I am responsibel for organizing presentation sessions in which speakers often bring their presentations in a flash drive. As a matter of policy, we will not allow speakers to plug in to our computers devices that run any kind of software in the background\n'

aS"\tHow to remove the U3 Launch Pad\n\tI bought the Cruzer Micro not knowing that it came with the U3 Launch Pad software preloaded. As soon as I tried to use it on my computer at work, the company's anti-virus/firewall decided it was an intruder, preventing it from working at all. I was ticked... I had almost given up on it and was actually shopping around for another USB drive that had no software on it, when I ran into a website that lets you download an uninstaller for the U3 Launch Pad. I downloaded it, ran it and it took no more than 15 seconds to clean out the offending U3 garbage! Now I like my Micro Cruzer all over again! Oh yeah... the website to uninstall yours at is: [...\n"
p249
aS"\tI hate this drive\n\tI wish I had read the reviews before buying this piece of junk. As another reviewer says, U3 ruins it. I have a Mac so that feature is useless, but even worse it cannot be disabled. Everytime I plug in the drive I get this cheesy CD image cluttering up my desktop and I have to eject it, along with the drive icon, before the unit can be removed. What clunky engineering. I'll be returning this and scratching Sandisk off my list of reliable companies. I also agree with the reviewer who complained about the packaging. It is impossible to open without tearing it apart, which is probably a strategy to reduce returns\n"

aS'\tA bad choice for 16x writing\n\tWith a destructive toddler in the house I like to back up my DVD movies.\nHaving recently purchased a 25 unit spindle, I recently tried backing up several DVDs with my sony DRU-710A 16x DVD recorder.  Although the recording process initially did seem to work smoothly,  when I attemped to play back the disks recorded at 16x speed, I would have read errors and lockups on DVD players usually towards the end of the film (the outside of the physical disk, where maximum recording speed is obtained.)\n   I did have better reliability recording at 4x speed and suspect that 8x writes will work fine as well.  Given the fact that I paid a premium for this new high speed media, I am disappointed.  I have had nearly 100% reliability with Memorex 8x DVD+R, recently making 25 successful recordings in a row with this brand (ASIN: B0001MKU4S\n'

aS'\tTHE BIGGEST MISTAKE I \'VE MADE!!\n\tDO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPY PIECE OF JUNK!!\n\nI purchased this unit with faith in SONY.  Well forget it!! after 4 months the unit failed and began reading "disc dirty" half way through each recording.   I sent the unit back for repair.  They claimed to have "fixed it" but when I received it back it STILL failed on each disc (note that these failures RUIN the disc!).  They sent  me a brand new unit.  GUESS WHAT..?!   It failed after 3 months with the SAME PROBLEM!!  I sent it back for repairs.   AGAIN they claimed to have "fixed it".  Well,  it malfunctioned IMMEDIATELY!! I sent it back AGAIN!! This time they gave me a refurbished unit. I know you wont believe this...but the unit is WORSE than the other two!!  They are currently sending me ANOTHER new unit.  But I have no doubt this one will STILL be a piece of crap.  They simply don\'t have this technology down. SONY should NEVER have put this junk on the market. BEWARE!!\n\n - UPDATE -\nThey sent they new unit.  Guess what?   PIECE OF JUNK.   Fails on discs writing and when reading written discs.   After trying FOUR of these units I can assure you this is a LEMON.   Please note these positive reviews are from buyer who had their units for two weeks or similar time periods.   I have had four different units for ONE YEAR and can tell you THIS IS JUNK!    Selling this crap on ebay and buying a REAL unit.   NOT SONY!\n'

aS'\tBetter late than never ...\n\tWe needed to know if this unit (Philips DVD 782C) was compatible with DVD+RW disks so I Googled it and found this Amazon listing.\n\nWe were totally amazed to find the reviews we found ... and wish we had done this years ago INSTEAD OF SPENDING ALL THIS TIME STRUGGLING WITH THIS POOR EXCUSE OF A DVD PLAYER. We have spent countless hours MR. Clean\'ing and SkipDr\'ing disks just to get them to play (and sometimes even that didn\'t work).\n\nJust in case anyone else comes along, take the excellent advice given several times in this collection of reviews ... RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION WITHOUT QUESTION IF SOMEONE OFFERS YOU THIS DVD PLAYER.\n\nNow, we do NOT believe this is a fundamental problem with Philips. We have, and have had, many fine products sold by Philips. We are guessing this particular DVD player was the result of some very poor product planning that went very badly before, during and after the fact. Hopefully the person(s) responsible has (have), per usual corporate practice, been promoted farther up the ladder where they can no longer inflict this kind of pain on Customers.\n\n\nP.S. We tried to give this product "0" stars but Amazon requires at least "1" star. Probably a quid pro quo agreement of some sort we imagine\n'

aS"\tLate Review But In Full Agreement\n\tUnfortunately my wife and I purchased this  and quot;product and quot; without reading the posted reviews here. ALL are entirely accurate! I cannot calculate how many hours I have spent trying to figure out what is wrong. No loading, skipping, freezing, not OPENING when it freezes, all down the line, combined with 100 trips to and from the video stores to exchange their  and quot;defective and quot; DVDs. My wife was firmly of the belief the DVDs were just  and quot;dirty and quot; but I finally decided (this agrees with one of the reviewers) there is a balance problem in the drawer. When there is a no-load, jiggling/adjusting the drawer sometimes (not always) fixes it, but only until the next time, and will not stop the freezing problems. If my wife had a dime for every time I said  and quot;this thing is a piece of @ and amp;*! and quot; she would be a millionaire. This is very late but if this product is still on the market in ANY form stay many miles away. And Philips' arrogant lack of response (as reported; I have no personal experience here) is virtually criminal in this day and age\n"

aS"\tI am unable to verify its ultra high performance\n\t~I bought the MVSV3-1m cable and put it between my Pioneer V555 DVD player and SONY WEGA tv KV-27FS12, I was unable to see with my naked eyes any improvement regading the visual quality, color, sharpness. Same as the result as I used the composite cable came with the box. I really don't know why. I have to say, my TV is a good one and the picture quality is already satisfactory even I don't use DVD player. Unfortunately my DVD player does not have component jack to let me try the next level video~~ experience. I don't want to say this expensive cable is a poor one, I was just unable to verify its alledged ultra high performance. we just don't have a benchmark to evaluate it.\n"

aS'\tWorst Customer Service Ever\n\tCowon aka iAudio have the worst customer service of any other major company I dealt with. No phone support, they have an 800 number but when you call it they direct you to their website. Their website support gives you the option to submit a ticket or Live Chat. I waited over an hour on their Live Chat before I get a message saying that Live Chat is not available at this time. I submitted a ticket  and  guess how long before I heard a response.  and  the response was "ship the item back for a refund". I also tried to download the latest firmware and the link was broken. I heard a lot about how bad their customer service was, but when I tried it myself it was even worse\n'

So I had to change my entire network over to this in order to get it configured.\nProblem #2 - once changed, now i have Ip address issues because of the existing clients picking up the .10 address.\nProblem #3 - If you incorrectly specificy the SSID/wep key or IP address, you have to put it back to the defaults and start over.  there's no way to configure the unit \nProblem #4 - it just plain don't work as it should.\n\nEasily the most difficult unit i've ever had to configure.

aS'\tNOT compatible with multifunction printers\n\tAfter 3 hours of banging my head against a wall I finally called Tech Support.

aS'\tAWFUL.  JUST AWFUL.\n\tI am shocked by the amount of positive reviews on this site.  Let me tell you about my experience.  I bought this machine in June of 2005.  In one year, I have replaced this machine THREE TIMES.  All three times, I got error messages that the toner cartridge was out (Toner Life End) even when new toner cartridges were put in.  I do give high marks to Brother for its customer service, though.  Each time I had a problem, I called and they sent out a replacement by FedEx along with materials for me to send back the broken one.  But when the fourth replacement arrived last week and I turned it on and got an immediate paper jam message, I had enough.  I had a similar issue with a Brother mutlifunction machine I purchased around the same time.  I am done with Brother products\n'

aS"\tReturned item, wasn't blue tooth\n\tI ordered this keyboard/mouse combo and it turned out to not be blue tooth, so I returned it.  I'm sure it would have been great if I had used it but my Mac has blue tooth and I thought I was getting a blue tooth kbd and mouse.   \nI got an apple blue tooth keyboard instead and I found a logitech blue tooth mouse, which I also got.  (Apple doesn't offer a decent blue tooth 2 button mouse in anything like an acceptably reasonable price range)\n"

aS'\tVery disappointing\n\tI purchased this for my Intel iMac mainly because I was so frustrated with the Mighty Mouse.  I wanted something with two separate buttons.  I had tried the Logitech MX 610 (which I purchased as well for another computer) and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful.  So, I purchased this desktop set because I wanted it to match my Mac and so I could have a proper 2 button mouse.  I figured the Mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well.  In fact, I thought I would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a Mac and had extra shortcut buttons.\n\nOther than having 2 separate buttons on the mouse, this keyboard/mouse combo has been an utter disappointment.\n\nFirst of all, the white doesn\'t quite match.  It\'s close, but just a touch too cream.  Also, there\'s just too much silver.  Especially on the mouse.\n\nSecondly, it doesn\'t have all the buttons the Mighty Mouse does.  There is no button to switch to the Widgets.  Luckily, you can press F12 on the keyboard.  Not quite as convenient, but still possible.  However, I have yet to find a button that allows you to switch between various open programs.  This is especially necessary if you have multiple web browsers open.\n\nThirdly, this mouse just doesn\'t work as well as other Logitechs.  It is too light, lacking the "feel" and a bit of the comforting weight that the MX 610 has when you move it around.  Also, the speed of the cursor is off.  No matter how I try to adjust the speed, it doesn\'t quite match the speed of the original Mighty Mouse.  It is either too fast or too slow.  I think part of it is simply OSX\'s lack of adjustability compared to [gasp] Windows for cursor speed.\n\nFinally, the keyboard is simply atrocious.  I don\'t even use it anymore.  It\'s packed up in the box and I plugged the original Mac keyboard back in.  The keys make a horrendous clatter when typing.  The pressure is nonexistant making touch typing just a bit more difficult than normal.  Also, the depth is quite shallow.  This is a desktop keyboard.  You can press the key down further on nearly all the laptop keyboards I\'ve tried.  Also, the texture of the keys is far too smooth and uniform.  The raised dots to help you find the F or J buttons is too shallow.  I can\'t find the asdf an jkl; rows by touch.  I have to look.  As a touch typist, this is an unforgiveable sin.  It basically transforms you from a touch typist to a hunt and peck typer who has to visually find each key before you can hit it.  I\'m typing on a Thinkpad whose laptop keyboard is far superior to this Logitech.\n\nSo, in short, save your money and avoid this keyboard/mouse combo.  I rated it a two because the mouse did have 2 separate buttons, unlike the Mighty Mouse, which is why I purchased this in the first place.  It hit my most basic requirement.  Otherwise, it really deserves a 1 star rating\n'

Then after a couple of minutes they turn themselves off. This drove me crazy and was not configurable.\n- Takes you ~15 seconds every time you turn them on and try to pair them.\n- Not terribly comfortable.\n\nAfter about a month of normal use, the headset cracked in the middle and stopped working. Bad quality o material. The Logitech people said they will refund whatever I paid for after I send them a copy of the receipt and the broken product. Too bad I get to pay for shipping and I'm not even sure they'll refund the ORIGINAL shipping. Lesson learned\n"

aS"\tBuyer Beware!\n\tI bought this unit because a DLink Sales Rep said it would be perfect for my application. Hah! It doesn't work at all (I hope Amazon will let me return it). The first thing I had to do was upgrade the firmware - no instructions on how to do this, but for the uninitiated: you have to download the .ftp file from Dlink, move it to the Dlink Firmware folder on your computer, then get the AP Manager to see your unit (that's another story involving IP addresses - again, no help from the install documents), and then you can install the update. I finally got the DWL-2100AP to see my network, but never could get it to talk back - it just sent gibberish. The Net tech and I worked on it for most of two working days, to no avail. Spent a lot of time on the phone with the DLink tech staff too, where everyone involved said we got some bad dope from the sales staff, but that we might get it to work, provided it is compatible with the existing equipment blah, blah, blah... My assessment of Dlink and the DLINK DWL-2100AP? Poor pre-sales support, poor post-sales support, confusing tech support, and poor documentation/install instruction for a product that may be (but then again, may not be) compatible with your existing equipment. What's up DLink\n"

aS'\tSoftware and installation issues, buyer beware\n\tMy family and I just relocated 3 states away from our extended family and wanted to get a good webcam to keep intouch with everyone and let our 2 year old see his grandmother once and a while.  When I saw the Microsoft LifeCam at Target stores and that it was compatible with Windows Live I thought it would be worth the $100 price tag to be able to keep in touch with family.\n\nI purchased the software and started the installation process on my computer.    Just so you know,my system is running a pentium 4 processor and has 8 active USB 2.0 connections, only 3 of which are being used for the keyboard, mouse, and this webcam, along with 512MB of RAM which is more than necessary for this product to function.\n\nThe software took about 10 minutes to install which I thought was a little odd, then it askes for you to plug in the camera.  My XP system recognized the camera but told me that the hardware had encountered an error during installation and may not function properly.  I uninstalled the software and tried the installation again with the same result.  I then tried a different USB port just in case there was a problem.  Following a stepwise process I checked and updated all drivers for the USB hub, ports, etc. and I checked under the system manager tools to ensure that all were working properly.  I then went to the microsoft website and downloaded the updates for the software (this took another 15 minutes and the site crashed twice).\n\nBy now I was getting very frustrated but hoped that the software update would allow appropriate conectivity with the camera.  I went into the software and found that it was recognizing the mic, but it said that there was no camera attached.  I again tried to find the camera through other means with no results.\n\nFor the price paid and the 3+ hours I spent trying to install the hardware I can say with all assurity that this product is not worth it.  I will be returning it to Target for a full refund and will look into investing my money with another brand.\n\nAs someone else said earlier in the reviews, "does microsoft ever send their products through Quality Assurance before they release them?\n'
p278
aS'\tSoftware issues\n\tDont microsoft ever send their software thru Quality Assurance checking?

It may be the highs all I know is the only thing it seems to filter well is my wife and kids voices and allow in every other ambiant noise around. \n\nNow I may have gotten a lemon but the sound is poor. Volume cranked to high on any device I put this on comes out low at best. Put in any other set of earphones and it is painfully loud. \n\nThe little inline triangle that has the on/off switch is cumbersome and is at a strange distance from the earphones. Just seems to far from the earphones or not far enough. Just doesn't seem to clip naturally anywhere. Either to much cord or not enough. \n\nI am not a music or sound expert by any means so it does not bode well that I think these earphones are poor at best\n"

aS'\tLousy Drivers, Lousy Customer Support  (but nice hardware)\n\tThe first warning sign is that the drivers are not Windows approved and unsigned. Their installation instructions advise you to ignore the warnings.\n\nNext, is the cheesy "cool" looking set-up program. Please forget about the groovy graphics and just provide a usable interface.\n\nThen, the drivers don\'t work. My cursor slides all around the screen after I stop moving the mouse. I tried calling customer support, but there is no telephone support. I then tried connecting with their online chat support. No one helped me after 20 minutes. Two days later, in response to an e-mail, they sent me 3 pages of instructions about how to adjust my system to accommodate their crappy software.\n\nToo bad, because the mouse itself is a nice piece of hardware. Solid-feeling, well-built, and comfortable.\n\nI\'m sending mine back for a refund\n'

aS"\tAbsolute junk!\n\tI bought it with my Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster. The software installation procedure is really poor. When I ran the software first few times it constantly gave me error messages (can't remember what they were) so I had to reinstall it 2-3 time till it settled down finally. Then I set up the network settings with my router and scanned for the access point (Infrastructure) but it couldn't find anything even though the router was only 5-7 feet away! At one point it managed to connect to the router but it was still searching for the internet connectivity.. After several minutes it couldn't find anything and disconnected from the router. I knew there was nothing wrong the router or internet because I inserted my old Belkin adapter and it connected straight away!\n\nDon't waste your money on this. If you wanna get a router, get the one I've got which is quite good. If you want a WiFi Adapter then get Belkin F5D7010 Wireless 54Mbps Notebook Adapter. I couldn't find any 108g adapters by them but this one is really good.\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000085BCX/qid=1125546516/sr=8-5/ref=pd_bbs_unbuck_5/002-4891207-7082407?v=glance and s=electronics and n=17259\n"

aS"\tTotally worthless\n\tThis product keeps changing home addresses; none of which are the address I typed in the initial field. It does not stay charged so that it is actually able to function as advertised if you are gone from home any length of time and you put your dog in a yard.  Additionally, gravity takes it down to the lower neck area in common use so that when the dog is doing normal dog things, the device sinks downward so that the antenna is pointing toward the ground.  The pictures are misleading.  We tried all of the advise the company gave us. It's just not a device that works when and where you need it to work.  It was a lot to invest to have this many problems.\n"

aS"\tThere's this cool new technology...\n\t... it's called a leash. Or a fence. How about keeping your pet safe the responsible-- not to mention cheap-- way. \n\nI've been a volunteer at a no-kill animal shelter for 5 years, and I'm still amazed at the lack of guardianship people show for their pets. So your dog has this $350-dollar doodad on its neck. It's not going to keep it from running out into the street and getting hit by a car, or picked up by somebody who wants to use it for dog-fighting bait or sell it to a lab (yes, these things happen-- often). \n\nHave some sense, people. This is ridiculous.\n"

aS"\tDoes not encrypt fingerprint!\n\tA nice device, but Microsoft didn't include software that encrypts the fingerprint image. Although very difficult to do someone *could* steal your fingerprint.

aS"\tImage nice, it works when it does, hard to Manage\n\tThis camera had some nice features like the ability to write to a network storage device, smart motion detection, etc.  The recorded videos have their own codec so you can use it or d-vix.  Some videos are unreadable and if you dig deep enough, d-link has a utility to make them readable.\n\nI upgraded the latest firmware 1.06, tried using the ability to write to a storage device and found it very hard to manage.  Motion triggering is touchy but works once you set it up.  The wireless caused 90% of my communication problems.  Ran a wire and things were fine.  Clock could not keep time for anything.  Set USA EDT and it was fine and shortly after it feel back one hour.  D-Link knows of this and the only solution was to use Atlantic time.  It has all the right features and image is great but I have to vote thumbs down on this unit.\n\nOne more thing, D-Link hard codes an IP address so if you try and factory reset remotely or of you happen to be using a different network addressing scheme, you're done.  Why for the life of me they don't use DHCP by default is beyond me\n"

aS"\tDon't waste your money\n\tI bought this for my 5g Ipod. I drive a late model Subaru with the lighter switch inside of the ashtray console. Firstly the transmitter was completely dangerous to operate while driving. Its impossible to use in Park and Neutral in my car. The controls are bulky.  The transmission cut out in mountains, on hills, and on the highway whenever I drove over 60mph resulting in my ipod starting and stopping because it shakes and wobbles in the console.  In short, it hardly worked and I was afraid to touch it while driving, lest I'd knock my gear shift out of place. Its cheaply made and all in all a complete piece of junk.\n\nThis is hands down the worst IPOD FM transmitter I have ever used.  I've previously used a basic Kensington all in one model  (stolen by wife, worked well but awkward) and ended up replacing this with a far superior Griffin Road Trip.  I reccommend spending the extra $15 on the Road Trip.\n"

p293
aS"\tFrustrating to use\n\tI have the same problem some other reviewers had: the audio was extremely low unless I manually adjust the cassette.  It's not that easy - you have to stick your finger into the cassette slot while the adapter is in there, and wiggle it forward and backward until the audio adjusts.  But that doesn't always work.  If that doesn't work, you then have to turn your hand over and use your fingernail to catch a ridge on the adapter and lift it up a bit.  I'd rather not have an accident on the highway by either (1) fiddling with the audio, or (2) smashing the adapter into little pieces while I drive.\n\nHundreds of songs on the ipod and no way to listen while you drive...\n"

It craped out after 9 months, and now I am on the fifth call to try to resolve the issue and get it shipped back. I don't know where their support is located, but the line quality is very bad, they ran the same drill over and over, but just don't want to issue you an order for you to ship back.\n\nThis is the first D-Link product I own and probably the last. The resolution looks crappy even when it's new, and now it's totally dead, even reset won't work on it\n"

aS"\tmy experience with this item\n\tYesterday was the annual Thanksgiving sale day. I got this 1G CF card from Staples by $40 after easy rebate. With this price, I think it is a great deal. However, it worked for my digital rebel only half an hour before it was DEAD. All my photos in the card were lost. I am a graduate student majoring in computer engineering, I know how to recover data if a hard drive fails. But this time, I find I simply can't help. Fortunately, Staples have a good return policy and I just returned it without hassle. Hopefully, this is only my case. My suggestion: make sure your dealer has a good return policy before you get this item.\n"

aS'\tKeyboard Dead in Less than 6 Months\n\tand the worst part is that I\'m actually glad about it!\n\nI bought this set to replace a [...]Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard combo that was about 3 years old when the mouse scroll wheel stopped working.\n\nI figured I\'d treat myself to what looked like the best wireless set out there.  Here\'s what I found:\n\n1) The keyboard is HUGE.  I have Dell 19" flat panel and the keyboard looks ridiculous in front of it.\n\n2) Even though the USB dongle is plugged in the Dell monitor about 1 foot from the mouse/keyboard it still loses its connection and I get the message "USB device has malfunctioned."  I have to remove and replace the dongle and it starts again.  This happens a couple of times a week, but of course at the most inconvenient times.\n\n3) The keyboard goes to sleep like the mouse after a few minutes to save battery life.  The mouse will wake up after a slight delay and I\'m used to that but I can\'t tell you how many times I pressed "Ctrl-C" to copy something into the buffer and then discovered that it didn\'t "take" because the keyboard was asleep.  The keyboard should never go to sleep or this "feature" should have a way to be disabled!\n\n4) The keyboard died (stopped responding) at less than 6 months old.  I still use the mouse but dug out an ancient Dell quietkey wired keyboard.  Frankly I don\'t miss the behemoth MS monster at all, at least the old keyboard doesn\'t take up the whole desk and when I hit Ctrl-C it works every time.\n\nMicrosoft has made some good keyboards and mice, but this set is not one of them.  Buyer beware.\n'
p302
aS"\tExtremely laggy mouse\n\tI bought this keyboard/mouse set hoping to consolidate most of my wireless devices onto a single HUB and standard.  \n\nSetting up the set was easy enough in Windows, but I immediately found that the mouse did not work well at all.  The cursor would move in increments of around 10 pixels at a time.  I even put the Bluetooth adapter on a USB extension cord and placed it within inches of the mouse, but that didn't help at all.\n\nThe keyboard seemed to work well, but I didn't use it for very long because the mouse was unbearable to use.  I have several wireless networks in my area, which may be causing interference with the Bluetooh though\n"

aS"\tDon't waste your money on this overpriced ripoff\n\tSpeaking from real experience, don't waste your money buying this cable which makes absolutely no difference from a cabe you can find with half or less the price. I bought a few top of the line monster cables once I got the top of the line SONY XBR960 HDTV. Later on I switched cables around, with other brand, cheaper component cables such as Philips PTS1000 (the HDMI standard owner by the way), and also other HDMI cables (even no name brands coming with my DVD player). You know what? I see absolutely no difference even under close examination. The SONY XBR960 produces the finest pitch you can find on any TV. You think about what that means. Stop buying this ridiculously priced cables, and save your $$ and buy somethinfg else on your shopping list. Digital is digital. Don't let monster mislead you that their cables produce more 11010 ... than others.\n"

aS"\tDevice is Barely Acceptable\n\tUsing this in my wife's Expedition is very annoying.  For some reason the cord must be placed in exactly the right position or static will drown out the music coming from the car's speakers.  Note that no other electrical devices in this car (and there are a lot of them; she got every option available with the car) misbehave at all.  I would not repeat this purchase, not can I recommend anyone else buy one of these.  I only gave it two stars because with continual minor effort it can be made to work acceptably - however, fiddling with the cord while driving is certainly NOT a safe practice\n"

aS"\tNEW = worthless thieves!\n\tNEW are notorious thieves in the consumer electronics repair industry.  I personally submitted for repair both a $1,600 video camera (Sony DCR-PC5) and a car CD player (a Sony CDX-C90, a $1,200 in-dash top of the line unit.  If you've heard of it, you know what I'm talking about).  I was told that the warranty did not cover what was wrong with my video camera (some ambiguous statement about logic board, power unit, etc. failure followed), and would have to pay ~$780 to have it fixed.  I naturally refused, and was forced to keep my dead 4 month-old handycam, an unfortunate testament to some of Sony's now widely publicized QC issues.  The reason I did not send in the camera initially has to do with the fiasco involving my CD player.  I was told, explicitly, that if NEW could not fix it, they would either return the unit or write me a check in the amount of $1,000 (not even enough to cover the cost of the player).  As an added insult, when they indeed could not fix the unit, they KEPT it, and I NEVER received a check!!!  Simply outrageous!  Blatant theft, and I'm not the only one who will tell you a story about NEW and such an act.  They are IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of, and literally take your money and run/disappear.  Don't expect to ever hear from them, should your camera stop working, and good luck getting ahold of them if you happen to send it in beforehand.  Chances are, you will have to eat the loss, as I did.  This product deserves a negative star and should come with an automatic refund.  I seriously thought it was a gag when I saw NEW was in charge of the coverage.  What a joke!  Whoever runs your company, NEW, ought to be both ashamed of themselves and held liable for all the countless damages and losses they have caused.  The whole lot of you belong in an unfriendly prison\n"

aS"\t4 years of svc...... several months of headaches\n\tI originally placed my order with my a digital camera and this four year service plan. Three days after, I had to cancel my digital camera order for personal reasons. However the $161.80 total I spent on this warrant did not refund automatically and nor have I received a confirmation that it will be refunded. After several phone calls and emails of providing information for the requested refund. They finally tell me that it will take 8 weeks for my refund to process. That is two whole months. Horrible service I can't imagine how long it would take for them to either repair or replace my camera should it have faltered. I would not recommend this four year service plan or any other plan by N.E.W. Customer Service Companies to anyone\n"

It also distorts at high volumes which you will need to use anyway because the sound is so low.\nIt runs out of power after only a few short hours.\nAnd worst of all, the headphones are impossibly tight, causing real discomfort. After only two days of using these headphones, I couldn't take it any more\n"

aS"\tGreat hardware and interface spoiled by poor map data\n\tI really wanted to like the TomTom Navigator 5.  \n\nThe GPS itself is tiny, well-designed, and very sensitive.  It worked fine from down in a underdash cupholder or in the glove compartment.\n\nThe interface is attractive and easy to navigate.  The voice prompts are clear and loud.\n\nThe installation on a Mac was problematic.  Search on TomTom OSX for details, but suffice it to say that the installer included on the CDs simply doesn't work and a new one must be downloaded.  Once past that, it ran fine on my Treo 700p.\n\nUnfortunately there is one fatal flaw - the map database.  In using the Navigator in both California and North Carolina, the maps regularly had misnamed streets, exits referred to by numbers where there were none, and directions that lacked critical information like heading (i.e. take the 101 instead of take 101N when approaching a complex interchange).  \n\nWorse, the company seems to be actively hostile to updating these maps.  If you go to the TomTom site, you can purchase maps on a city-by-city basis.  Are they newer than the ones that came with your unit?  Who knows?  TomTom lists no version info and seems to expect you to buy and cross your fingers.\n\nThere were just too many errors that I saw while traveling in areas that I'm familiar with to trust the TomTom maps for any unfamiliar territory.  Everything else is great, but the whole point of a GPS is accurate navigation.  And sadly, that's where the TomTom Navigator fails\n"

Almost $300 and several months later, I am unable to get this hunk of junk to even turn on.  Let alone connect to a server.  All of these things were supposed to be fixed by a 'patch' that if someone can download from the HP website, I'd love to see it.  All downloads came back with an Error message when I attempted to download.  \n\nLong story short, you'd be better off buying a laptop.  HP is not known for their handhelds, do not buy this product or anything similar to this from HP.  You will be sorry.\n"

aS"\tRegional coding\n\tI cannot recommend HP to anybody anymore. The company introduced regional coding, which means printer cartridges from one region cannot be used in another. For most this is probably not an issue, for those busily traveling around it is. Also, it is an issue of principle, its bad enough for DVD, but printer cartridges? HP has introduced this rather secretely and if you don't read the box cover etc very carefully, you may not notice. The main issue is in Europe. I got caught out. I bought a 3 catridges overseas - I could not use them on my HP printer. I asked for a refund, HP Email Support (US) was nice but ineffective. HP Customer Support (Europe) was snotty and very rude. I think HP does not care about its customers and this cost me over US$75, almost 50% of my printer (my sixth and last HP). Don't buy HP\n"

When that didn't work, they told me the product was defective.  Unfortunately, they refused to take it back themselves and made me deal with the Seller (ANTOnline.com) first (not a very good seller, btw, as they gave me a terrible time when I tried to return the defective product).  \n\nHopefully you'll have better luck.\n\nAlso, be sure to check out whether Vosky is officially supporting Skype 2.5.

Those of you who are clean freaks like me, BEWARE. Products like armour all which leave a protective coating on your dash will further reduce the grip of this stand! I would not trust a $800 piece of equipment on an unreliable stand like this when even a slight touch of a finger can make it slide down. What about jolts and bumps while normal driving?

The powerline etherernet works flawlessly, I've had it up and running for six months without restart or problem into three other rooms.  The wireless module however tends to overheat and drops the network after 24-48 hours of operation, so she has to unplug it every time she is done with the network, and plugs it back in whenever she wants to connect.  I am going to upgrade her to another wired powerline ethernet module\n"

aS"\tand lt;em>Poor fit, poor quality sound, decent mic and lt;/em>\n\tEveryone has already covered the basics, so here's the highlights:\n\n The audio listening quality is poor, especially for 40mm drivers (which normally sound good with strong bass response).  This is due to the fact the speaker itself is far from the ear canal, since the outer padding contacts the side of the head instead of the actual speaker pad.\n\n The headphones are heavy, which means a large amount of pressure is required to hold them in position.  They slide very easily off the head, and apply a lot of downward force on the ears.  I have a big head, and even made some slight modifications that increase the pressure, now they don't slide off, but are uncomfortable for more than an hour of use.\n\n At first, the volume slider is stiff, but then becomes smooth.\n\n After 4 months of use, the mute switch is getting loose, I don't expect it to work 4 months from now.\n\n I really like the microphone portion of the headset, the angle is adjustable, and the volume is loud and clear.\n\n In the end, these headphones have a good microphone matched with very poor quality headphones.  Next time, I'd grab the cheaper Logitech headset, where they are nice and light and the speaker pads make contact with the ears, not some large outer pad\n"

aS'\tNot for people with small heads...\n\tI purchased this unit not for gaming, but for making PC to PC calls.  Here are my observations:\n\nPros:  \n1.

Chord is robust and long.  Easily fits over my long desk to my CPU that rests beneath.\n3. Controls are easy to use, although the mic on/off switch doesn\'t click into place like I\'d expect it to.  It just slides back and forth.  I can see people accidentally turning it off.\n4. Headphones produce good sound, although nothing extraordinary.\n5. The mic itself freely rotates, so you can position it however you desire.\n\nCons:\n1. First and foremost, if you\'ve got a small head DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!!  My head is not big and these headphones ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE!  These headphones are so large that they\'re actually uncomfortable.  Their entire weight rests on my ears and I can\'t wear them for very long without my ears falling off.\n\n2.  These headphones are very heavy, uncomfortably so.  I\'ve resorted to holding them up to my head and listening through one speaker to take the weight off my ears.\n\n3.  Perhaps having the airspace between the speakers and the frame keeps your ears cooler, but it still feels like I\'m wearing a set of insulated ear muffs.  Chatting on hot summer days is limited to 10 minutes or less until I\'m dying of heat exhaustion.\n\n4. You need to get a Y splitter if you wish to have these headphones and your computer speakers on at the same time. If you don\'t have front headphone plugs on your case this is an issue.  Otherwise you have to crawl under your desk and manually disconnect the headset from your motherboard jacks and plug in your speakers again.  Y splitters are only a few dollars but it\'s an accessory you will have to purchase, especially since front speaker ports on most computers can\'t be hooked up at the same time as your rear motherboard jack (and most people have their main sound systems plugged in with the rear one). Granted, this is more of a general microphone/headset combo issue than anything Logitek related, but if this is your first microphone/headset purchase then you should be aware of this problem.  I use onboard audio instead of a sound card, so I don\'t have multiple output jacks.\n\n5. These headphones are designed to rest behind your neck, not over the top of your head.  Unfortunately, the plastic beam is too heavy and pulls the speakers back, placing all the weight on your ears.  The plastic beam is also too short (and just!) to go over the top of my head for a more comfortable fit.\n  \n6. The design also doesn\'t make sense.  The beam is so short that it should rest behind your neck, yet the angle of the speakers through that air gap is better for wearing the beam over your head.  It\'s pretty uncomfortable.  If the headset was adjustable it would be fine!  The earpieces are just too huge!\n\nOverall I\'m disappointed with these.  If you\'re under 5\'10" I say go with another model.  The hardware works great, but the design is terrible.  I\'m returning these and purchasing an uglier, but more functional, set of smaller headphones\n'
p331
aS'\tThe mic is not good. The design is not very comfortable\n\tThe headset sits on the back of head, which is ok, however due to large ear rests it feals awkward and uncomfortable. I was not able to use volume control, as the headphones were only audible at higher volume level.\n\nThe mic is poor.  Whether you want it for gaming or just general purpose use, its better to skip this for something else\n'

aS"\tCool toy, but not a useful tool\n\tI have been using the Palmone Navigator with my TX for about eight weeks.  Most of my comments are based on a comparison with the built-in navigation system in my Lexus.  \n\nSoftware installation is fairly easy.  However, you need at least a 256 MB SD card to load more than a couple of states; I recommend a 1 or 2 GB card.  \n\nWhile the concept of a TX doubling as a navigation device is intriguing, the realty of it is rather sobering.  It is a cool toy, but if you have to plan routes for your job or any other meaningful purpose, this is NOT the right product.  \n\nThe pros are:\n - Inexpensive in comparison to built-ins und stand-alone products\n - Unit can be used in different locations and cars and even while walking\n - One device serves multiple purposes\n\nThe cons are:\n - It can take up to several minutes after starting the unit to acquire a satellite signal.  This is not the case with my car's OEM navigation system.\n - The maps are outdated and not as precise as the OEM nav system:  I live in Phoenix, AZ and my neighborhood (built seven years ago) as well as most of the freeways I take to work and back don't exist on the software.  More recent updates are not available (I checked the Tomtom website).\n - Navigation is often not precise enough (e.g. it tells me to make a left in 50 yards, when I have already passed the intersection where it wants me to make a left).  I never have this problem with the built-in navigation.\n - Look-up function for addresses and phone numbers is clumsy and doesn't display actual address until you map it.\n - It tends to freeze at least a couple times a day, requiring a soft reset.  \n - Lost connections to the satellite receiver or lost satellite signals also tend to disrupt the navigation on longer trips with stops.\n\nOverall, the unit is too unreliable to be used as your only navigational aid.  If you need navigation to get to your travel destination, you are better off with a stand-alone unit.  I truly wish I had better things to say about this device since I really like the concept, but the reality just doesn't match the marketing.\n"

aS"\tGreat when it works - but far too flaky\n\tThe GOOD news is that this is a full featured GPS solution that is easy to mount in the car and can navigate to contacts in your address book. Maps are detailed and the POI (Point of Interest) database is fairly extensive.\n\nThe BAD news is that it all too often fails to connect via Bluetooth. Installation of software and maps is error prone (do not follow any of the 'advanced' hints in the manual - they scrambled my SD card). \n\nOnly buy this product if you like puzzle solving and have a great deal of patience. If you are expecting an out of the box solution that is 100% reliable - look elsewhere.\n"

I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....\n"

aS'\tShould have check first\n\tI went looking at Fry\'s for a mapping software and bought this before looking online at reviews.

I still can\'t figure out how to access any info on Hawaii or Alaska and I\'m waiting each time an average of four days before "tech support" haha will write me back.\n\nDon\'t buy this.\n'

aS"\tKeyboard Layout Sucks; Mouse Only 2 Buttons + Wheel\n\tThe keyboard with this set is flimsy and cheap feeling.  \n\nWorse, the layout is nonstandard: they've messed up the key cluster above the arrows (Insert/Delete/Home/End/etc.).  And the right hand Ctrl is not below the right end of the Shift key, it is under the left end of the Shift key, where one of the Windows keys (the context menu one) normally is.  They've taken out one of the Windows menu keys, too.  \n\nThe wireless features worked fine (I've used it two days) and worked even without installing their driver software (something I'm always reluctant to do).  I think some of the extra buttons (multimedia controls) on the keyboard don't work for me, because of this.  I use the computer it's on for work, not screwing around, so this doesn't bother me.  (I have it installed on a Thinkpad laptop so I can keep the screen farther from my eyes, and my employer bought the thing; it wouldn't have been my first choice.)\n\nI've given it two stars only because it worked great, out of the box, with no driver software.  (This is on a Thinkpad running WinXP.)  I'm already dreading the battery usage (based on another review here).  Thankfully, it's not my main keyboard\n"

aS'\tI wouldnt recommend this unit\n\tIve had this unit for over a 1+ year and ran into problems with reception it would drop signal and it would eventual come back.

p343
aS"\tYou get what you pay for...\n\tI bought this printer because I wanted high quality photo printing and I didn't need any of the bells and whistles that come with more expensive printers. It's a Canon, so I figured I could count on the photo quality. I was terribly disappointed though. I generally buy Staples brand photo paper for general photo printing, and it always worked fine with my Epson printer. But my first prints on this printer looked dull and muddy -- like I was looking at the images though a mild but annoying grey/brown haze. So I went out and bought Canon paper instead. The quality was somewhat improved, but still not what I had expected. So yes, I got a printer for under $30, but now to get even passably OK prints, I need to spend a fortune on Canon brand inks and paper. Not much of a bargain.\n"

It would take a double-jointed freak of nature to comfortably push it.\n* The case is a dust and hair magnet. Every time you pull it out of your pocket, it's encrusted with lint you didn't even know you had. Dust manages to sneak under every surface, and hair magically sticks to it. This case is a DNA-sample paradise for forensic experts.\n\nOne of the features of a flash-based memory player is the fact that they won't break as easily when you drop them. Unless you're paranoid about getting scratches on your shiny new Sansa, don't buy this\n"

aS"\tBad product from KB Electronics\n\tI bought this product from KB Electronics.\n\nBecause of this product, my digital camera stopped working.\n\nOn giving a bad review to this product, KB Electronics offered me 10% discount on my next product. So, I told them that I would give a good review to them if they can repair my camera. At this they went silent. So, basically this means that they would try to make someone silent with a few dollars, but if they have to fix their problems, then they would forget all morals and turn dumb.\n\nI don't know about the current company, but beware of the same thing happening to you guys. It is possible that KB Electronics has started selling the same product by the name of its sister concern - businesses do this all the time\n"

aS"\tGreat until it broke\n\tI bought this player a little over a year ago, mainly for the ability to upgrade the firmware to region-free. Played everything I put in it until a few days ago, when it started having intermittent problems- graphics were staticy and blocky, sound would just buzz and it wouldn't eject discs until I shut it down and restarted it. That lasted for two days before the problem became permanent. Now it's a doorstop.  The Apex web site appears to be down right now, but based on the other reviews here I doubt there's much point in contacting them\n"

aS"\tEver wished you hadn't spent your money...\n\tThe resaon I purchased this sport case is because it was an Apple product. My thoughts were that is I was going to dive into the ipod experience I should invest in a quality case to protect it. I'm sure that most people would think the way I do. I read the reviews and felt that even though it was a little pricey I would go ahead. This product is not a good one for the price. Mine broke, specifically, the plastic slider on the side that locks the shuffle in. I know what your thinking... she abused the product but I swear I did not. I loathe returning things but, darn it, this is ridiculous. Avoid this one and go for something less expensive.\n"

aS"\tNot as fast as they claim\n\tThough the concept is great, and the controls are straight forward and easy to use, the Belkin Reader falls short of usability. \nWhile out on a location, I was away from a power source and thought the Belkin reader would be a great alternative to lugging a laptop around for file transfers. Trying to transfer 1000 pics off a 1GB CF card was \nimpossible. The reader would drain a fully charged ipod and still not finish the transfer. Though it claims firewire transfer speeds, I did some tests from home and found otherwise:\n\n100 compressed 2K pics transferred via:\n\nUSB1 card reader to computer 1 min 20 sec.\nPCMCIA card reader in laptop 45 seconds.\nBelkin Media reader 6 min. 45 sec\n\nThis was just a simple example. You can see how hundreds of files would take 30 minutes or more. For the price, I'd suggest buying a few more memory cards and not worry about the transfers until you get home, unless you're in no rush and can charge up the ipod regularly\n"

aS"\tDestined for the back of a drawer\n\tI found the armband to be uncomfortable and inconvenient.  I think the upper arm is just a bad place to carry an iPod.  The added weight is distracting when I'm running.  Even worse is any activity that requires me to flex my biceps at all, so lifting weights is out.  Put it on too tight, and I constrict the muscle.  Loosen it a little, and the band slips off.  There is no happy medium.  Also, the earphone cord gets in the way more when it's leading from my arm.\n\nThe belt clip that came with my iPod mini works much better for me.  I clip it on the waistband of my sweatpants when I'm working out and it remains very secure, even when I'm running on the treadmill.  And the cord stays close to my body, where it is far less likely to get caught on something.\n\nThe only advantage of this product is that it lets you advertise to the world that you own an iPod mini.  Big deal.  My armband is destined to be forgotten in the back of a drawer at home\n"

aS'\tVery Poor Quality\n\tDo not waste your money on this product!! Whilst Amazon has a very good price for it, the headset is junk! I tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum. The hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines. It could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible. I work for the phone company and have used headsets over the past 25 years with no problmes. This set is very poor quality and not worth the money.\n'

aS"\tBuzz in microphone\n\tAmazon quickly shipped this item to me and I was ready to rock 'n' roll -- until I plugged it in.  There was a distinct buzzing noise that both myself and the caller on the other end could hear.  The buzzing noise stopped when I hit mute, so the Plantronics rep said it was a microphone problem.  Amazon was very gracious about their return policy and I was quickly sent a new phone free of charge.  Well, the second phone does the same thing and I'm returning it to get a refund.  Maybe just my phone line?  Possibly.  But I've tried two phones now and have the same problem with both\n"

aS"\tSound quality ok, but\n\tBought C01U and was glad I could send it back after a testing period: \nTried it witih Ableton Live on OS X 10.4.7 and a MacBookPro. Sound Quality was okay but either the buffer was too small (which caused the sound to scratch every few seconds) or the buffer was too large which ended in a lag causing me to get distracted from my monitor-earphones. I tried for about two hours to find the right balance but it didn't work out. This Microphone might have a nice sound but I can'T recommend it for high standard voice recording.\n"

aS"\tCan't connect at 108mbs, max is 54mbps\n\tThe card worked really well except for one little thing. There is no way to enbale super G mode (you need it to connect at 108mbps).  Without the most I could connect at was 54mbps.  The quick install guide and the manual said it's available, but it wasn't.  Tech support was able to reproduce my problem, and tried many, many things. Even though they were very helpful, they coudln't fix it.\n\nMy guess is that it's going to take a firmware upgrade to enable Super G.  If you can wait for that, then you will be happy.  I returned mine, and bout a Linksys WPC54GX\n"

aS'\tI hope Sony will go back to the old (SRF-H3) design\n\tLike another reviewer, I had the SRF-H3 model, and loved them - comfortable, secure, decent sound, and *almost* indestructable.\n\nI was hoping these would be "new and improved". Well, they are new... I really do not like them. The electronics/sound seem to be at least as good as the SRF-H3, which is fine, but the new design does not work for me at all, for 3 reasons.\n\n1. The bigger band that goes over the top of the head is almost square - flat on top, instead of curved, so the weight all rests right on the crown of my head.\n\n2. The smaller band, instead of keeping it secure, just loosens up rather than hanging on.\n\n3. The earpads, which were on wobbly stalks on the SRF-H3, to match the angle of the ears, are fixed on this model. so they push more on the rear edges of my ears, and push the headphones forward.\n\nThe quality of the electronics and sound don\'t do much good if the things are a pain to wear. Maybe they will work well for some head shapes, but not for mine. Bummer... Maybe I can find the old model somewhere.\n'

aS"\tGreatly Disappointing\n\tI can't say enough positive about Logitech mice.  This device, however, was a dismal disappointment.  The PC interface works well, and its knowledge of existing components seems impressive.  Unfortunately, that in no way translates into a good remote interface.  The ability of the unit to reliably turn on multiple components was poor, and, for those with video recorder boxes, very important functionality like the ability to access or schedule recording lists is not readily available (if its there at all, its hidden many keystrokes deeper than I care to know about).  Even when reverting to manual operation of individual components, changing which device is being accessed involves two keystrokes (as opposed to just one on less complex universal remotes--a much more irritating trait than one might think).  Overall, for day-to-day functionality I actually consider the barely-programmable remote that came with my Scientific Atlanta DVR vastly superior to the Harmony, which I've given up on after only a few days of forced use.\n\nConsidering the ridiculous pricetag, I strongly advise you save yourself a lot of money and your relatives a lot of frustration this year by steering clear of this sad study in user interface failure\n"

aS'\tGood B/W print/scans, poor software and color scans\n\tUsed this unit for a few weeks and returned.\n\nAnnoyances:\n\nSofware: With ADF scanning, you have to enter scan parameters (paper size etc) again for every scan and it does not have an option to let you to continue scanning more pages then ADF can hold. You will have to use "add to file" function and select all scan parameters again. There is no option to scan double-sided pages as well with using 2 pass scanning. So 3rd party software is definitively needed to get a real value out of ADF scanning.\n\nColor Scanning: While B/W scans are fast, color scanning speed is very poor to me. Scanning stack of color pages could take ages. Slow color scanning speed was observed in both USB and network modes. \n\nFAX: Number of rings before FAX answers is limited to 4 and I found no way to increase that. No good for SOHO\n'

aS"\tQuit working after printing three pages successfully\n\tConfusing light display (looking in the manual) told me there was a paper jam after printing three pages.  There is no jam. There is nothing stuck in the printer.  Sending it back now.  I do not have time to troubleshoot a new printer that fails to work properly after three pages.  (Maybe you won't have time either!)  I am very tech savvy and have checked the manual.  The device simply is defective.  \n\nI also noted that the top lid that folds down for packing to travel seems very flimsy.  It's hard to imagine it would not break in time, and since it's the paper feeder, you'd be out of luck.  I'd recommend something else\n"

Only complaint is the cumbersome battery case and cheap feeling plastic construction. However, none of this mattered when it just stopped working 4 months after purchase. Gave absolutely no signs before hand, just working one day, completely dead the next. There are other reviewers here that shared my same fate, so if you want to gamble with these, go ahead, but know that the risk is a pair of dead headphones.\n'

aS'\tNot impressed\n\tI am an RPN devotee and have owned two other HPs going back to the original 11C. But this calculator is horribly unreliable because it seems to ignore key entries occasionally.

Be sure and save your receipt because quality control is absent on this one.\n'

aS"\tPay a little more and get something better\n\tThis was my first set of in-ear headphones and I bought them because they are cheap.  Well, you get what you pay for.  Being disappointed with the fit of the Koss phones, I bought the slightly more expensive JVC HA-FX55V.  At least for me, a much better fit, which means more comfort and better sound.  And I am still shopping.  The array of offerings is daunting:  JVC and JPlug at about $20 all the way up to Shure's top of the line at $500.  So shop around, but forget about the Koss\n"

aS"\tWho really knows until it's too late...\n\tThis warranty is purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distributed by another company.  When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices.  I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was.  They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.  The one difference between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200.\n"

aS'\tQuality control problems\n\tBought this as a back-up for the internal hard drive of the laptop. My experience was sadly similar to  many others on this site. Worked fine for two backups, then the drive stopped being recognized by my own or any other computer. Little red "power" light is on, little disc whirls around, but no blue "data transmit" light appears anymore. These are clearly a dismally unreliable and poorly made product- just imagine the disaster if this occurred when you were trying to restore data to a corrupted hard drive on your primary machine. A free replacement would not be much of a compensation. Avoid!!\n'

aS'\tiPod - Great toy - Horrible customer service/support\n\tThe iPod is cool but ours ... as we\'ve found has happened to many other owners ... went on the fritz and our nightmare began. Apple\'s customer service is the worst CS that we\'ve ever experienced regardless of the product or service supported. I could write for days about the awful experience but I\'ve wasted so much time with them already ... I can\'t bear to waste more. The most notable point is that the iPod CS folks repeatedly stated that iPods are more or less disposable, commodity items and "breakdowns" were common. Wow!! .. $400 Bucks of throw away!?!?!? We still haven\'t recieved the return box for replacement/repair after several days even though it was promised in 24-48 hours. We also own an MP3 player that we refer to as a "Dell-Pod" from Dell Computer and have had to use their customer service as well. Dell\'s CS support was awesome. Based on our experience with Apple/iPod CS support ... this is the first and LAST Apple product that will be owned in our household\n'

aS"\tMicrophone volume too low and can't be set\n\tShort answer: The microphone volume on this is set too low relative to the speaker volume, and cannot be adjusted independently--either through the device or at the O/S level.\n\nI spoke with tech support, and they said this was to keep the echo-cancellation software from having issues.\n\nSo as a speakerphone, this device is useless.\n\nI'd have given it one star, but the rest of the device is actually very well designed, easy to setup, and so on.\n"

aS'\tLCD display broke after 2 months\n\tI was fairly satisfied with this phone until I had to re-arrange my office and move my phone.  Once I moved it and then tried to reconnect it, I no longer had LCD functionality or speakerphone functionality.\n\nI looked on their website and this is what it said on their FAQ:\n\nProblem:\nNo caller ID information received\nDoes the LCD screen on the handset show anything?\nNo\nYour telephone is defective and needs to be sent in for service\n\nSince it is on their FAQ I would assume this is a common problem.  In trying to exchange my phone they were insistent that I send my phone in first so they could look at it and then refurbish it / exchange it.  Since I use this phone for my home office this was problematic for me.  \n\nI would not recommend this product.

aS'\tDid I get a bad sample? Totally disappointed!\n\tYes, I burned them in for at least 25 hours. They sounded muddy. Smooth as caramel, but veiled. The bass was heavy and indistinct. The high frequencies were not clean, and not abundant. \n\nHaving listened to Stax headphones for years and years, I know I got used to a superclean, almost clinical sound. But still I cannot believe how completely different the HD600s were. \n\nI borrowed these from a friend, who bought them new and had hardly used them. Frankly, I get more pleasure listening with my Sony MDR-W20G sports headphones that I bought for less than $10.   I am at a loss to understand the glowing reviews. I would love to hear a headphone that sounds as wonderful as people are describing. But the one I heard did not. Not even after break-in.  Never would I consider one of these phones without auditioning them. Perhaps I truly heard a rare, defective unit. But if so, both drivers were defective, because they sounded the same.\n'

aS"\tDecent but there has to be a better solution somewhere out there!\n\tI recently received an iPOD Photo and after loading in tons of CD's I said  . . . hey why not buy an all in 1 adapter for my car.  My transpod arrived but I had difficulty inserting the adapter into my car's charger.  After working that out and using it everyday for a week, it stopped working.  I realized that the fuse had blown.  It's small and relatively compact unlike the Griffin RoadTrip, but it's a whole lot of drama for the price.  \n\nWith regard to the quality of the sound through my vehicle's audio system, I am extremely disappointed.  What sounds like a million dollars through headphones does not translate to what you hear through fm radio frequencies.  I have adjusted the iPOD's equalizer and played around with some options inside my car, but I am extremely disappointed.  If someone has a better alternative . . .

aS"\t100 uses for a dead mouse\n\tWhen it works, this mouse is simply wonderful. Small, accurate, easy to recharge, easy to carry. Under those conditions, it's probably my favorite mouse. I've found that it's equally good for both Mac and Windows.\n\nOne complaint is that when it's tethered to the USB port for recharging, it works nominally, but becomes very slow and awkward. It's not at all the same behavior as seen when it's completely free to move.\n\nMy first incarnation of mouse lived a long life of about 10 months. My second incarnation of mouse, however, just died at the tender age of 4 months. I've attempted mouse-to-mouse resuscitation, but to no avail, having found that Iogear technical support exists by name only. I have sent multiple requests for help, and have received not a single answer. Both mice died identical deaths. Suddenly it stops being able to hold a charge, and freezes after about 5 minutes of use. Even when tethered to the USB port for a recharge it freezes. \n\nI'm sad that a technologically good product should have such terrible quality assurance in its manufacture. And such terrible customer support in dealing with its lack of QA\n"

I videotape my sons basketball games for their coaches and it was only after the first couple of games and bad recordings that I got onto Canon's website and realized my video head was clogged.

aS"\twaste of money\n\tRun WinXP, sp2 with everything updated.  I've had this router for 6 months.  It is the WGT624v3, firmware updated.  I never realized how bad the wireless was on this router until this week - dropped connetion 3 times in 15 minutes today alone, while reading the Amazon.com reviews.  \nMy desktop PC's  graphics card went down this past week and I had to RMA it... so about 10 days to send out and get a return.  I have always used a wired connection for my home desktops.  The wireless access was a 'it's there if I need it' novelty.  I started brining my IBM R51 laptop home from work so I could get online, VPN into work, etc..  This is the first time I have used my wireless consistently for more than a hour or so.\nThe last 10 days have been rediculous to say the least.  I logged on my first day and lost connection 5-6 times browsing MSN and Yahoo.  At first I thought it might be channel interference since 2 other routers in range were using channel 11.  I went ahead and disabled the 108G feature since I had never come close to hitting that speed anyways, and changed the channel..  I used the IBM ThinkVantage software to scan my area for other wireless routers and picked a channel not being used.  I changed channels and I verified my signal strength before and after I changed, 95% signal strength. The connection is still getting dropped randomly.  Changed channel to another channel not being used in my area and verified signal strength.  No difference.  Scanned the networks again using the IBM ThinkVantage software.. theres my router, 97% signal strength @ 54Mbs.  unplugged router, modem, repaired my WINSOCKS with WinsockXP, rebooted PC.  I turned on my modem first until is was ready to go, then the router until it was ready, and then my PC (as per the netgear website)and yea, no difference in the connections stability.  The conection is still getting dropped randomly.  \nI might expect this from a router thats on all the time and is getting tired from constantly being hammered. But I hardly ever used the wireless access (yes, wireless radio has been OFF).  After reading these reviews, I am pretty sure the problem wont go away.  \nThe part that upsets me the most, I payed premium money for a product that I thought was premium.  If this had been priced (at the time) at bargain bin prices, I wouldn't of cared.. but it wasn't and i do.  The 'you get what you pay for' saying does not hold true for this product. \nBuyer Beware\n"

For ten dollars more, she could have purchased a product that does everything this one does (it is essentially a $35 car charger) plus the tuner.  If you want to use this product to actually listen to your iPod in your car, you\'ll need to purchase yet another device: either the cassette adapter (old school! part F8V366-APL) or the FM transmitter (part F8V367-APL).  Either one connects through a jack in the side of this unit.  The FM transmitter is another $40 (you\'re now $20-30 over what the Monster iCarPlay, which does all of the above, would have cost you)...and, surprise!  The transmitter takes AAA batteries!  There\'s no way to power the transmitter through the Auto Kit.  To power the FM transmitter without batteries, you must purchase yet a third accessory, the "Mobile Power Cord for iPod" (F8V7067-APL, just $15!)...except your car\'s power plug is occupied by the Auto Kit, so you\'ll need to buy a twin-plug adapter for that.\n\nAre we having fun yet?

aS'\tMac users: D-Link\'s claims about compatibility are false. Look elsewhere\n\tI have a G4 tower Mac that did have a built in Ethernet.  Unfortunately, a lightening strike took out the port and I was forced to get a PCI card to replace the port.  The first card I bought was the D-Link DFE-530TX+.  I was excited because the box clearly said that the card would work with Macs and that the "minimum requirement" was OS 10.2.\n\nThey lied.  OS 10.2 is the _maximum_ for this card.  For most people, it won\'t work with 10.3 and up.  D-Link has no driver for 10.3 or higher, only 10.2.  A google search shows that some people have been able to get the card to work with 10.3.  I couldn\'t.  I tried several different drivers (some users recommended a driver from Realtek) and none worked.\n\nIt\'s my guess (and totally a guess) that this card is really only for older Macs that are limited to 10.2.  D-Link doesn\'t seem to have any intention of supporting modern Macs.\n\nThis is the second D-Link product I\'ve used (the first was a cable modem) and I\'ve been disappointed both times.

aS"\tCheap as in Quality not Price\n\tI commute via public transportation, the majority of that on a noisy train. Earbuds and over ear headphones don't block out enough of the noise to enjoy the music. I received these Philips HN110 headphones as a gift. \n\nWhen I first got these I was pretty disappointed at how flimsy they appeared. I have some KOSS over ear head phones which are nice and beefy. These are scrawny but on the other hand take up less space. They use a single AAA batt. Using them on the train I was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through. I'm not an expert on these but I guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies. Alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through. The next thing I noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off. My KOSS and Sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there (or it runs through the headphone band). I realize I like this single cord feature very much. Again these Philips HN 110 don't have this. \n\nI also noticed that when the Noise Cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified. \n\nAfter about a month and a half the battery compartment door latch broke inside. Now I can't open the battery compartment without doing some damage to these headphones. I checked Philips website for info on these phones but I couldn't find any. I called their customer support and they told me I had to call a different #. I called the different number and got the Return Merchandise Authorization # but was told I need to send the receipt in. I got them as a gift so I don't have the receipt. \n\nIn summary, their noise cancelling ability is pretty week. Better than my hefty non-noise cancelling KOSS over ears or my stethascope like Sony ear buds but only by about 10% or so (just to put a number in their). Flimsy design. Cords from both earphones. Hear the wind amplified. Battery compartment latch broke after a month and a half and their warrenty sucks\n"

It tries  to install drivers every time.\nTHird, removing old and adding new MP3 is such a hassle. It takes minutes to delete old files and add new. Seems like you are working with a floppy.\nFourth, its Mojo software hangs all the time.\nFifth, it sucks battery life.\nSixth, if your MP3 is not in a directory, i.e. if copied directly, it wont show. Then it wont delete and will show 200 MB as not free space. Formatting is the only way out.\nSeventh, it came with a mail in rebate which never showed up.\nOverall, a bad experience\n'

aS'\tPoor Quality and "Zero Customer Service"\n\tDoes the unit work??,...Well yes to a degree. It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. The display is poor and though they say "up to 40 objects per hole" there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn\'t think was important.\nNow the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again,...which it will often,..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn\'t good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour, they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another,... duh,.... NO\n'

aS"\tBe an educated consumer!  You don't have to spend a lot for *digital* cables\n\tYou don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals.  Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel?  There's no gold inside!  So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables.   If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie.  Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference.\n\nWith analog signals, a good quality cable may make a difference (although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope).\n"

aS'\tGreat product, terrible cost.\n\tHave you ever heard the saying that something would cost you "an arm and a leg"? These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don\'t get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they\'re just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables.\n\nSeveral people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error-correction and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future, there\'s really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes, the gold-plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit, but the improvement will be far less than you\'d see between any other "cheap" versus "designer" cables on the market.\n\nBut Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference, and that\'s worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy, so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn\'t just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn\'t doubt if they\'re certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you\'re looking at the right cables.\n\nBut for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections. And over these products, the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time, and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You\'ll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables\n'

aS"\tThink Before You Buy\n\tIf you can't abide an ever-present low hiss in the background, and louder interference in the presence of power lines, don't buy this product.  I wish I'd read the reviews more carefully before I bought.  A number of even the most favorable ones mentioned this annoyance.\n\nThe manufacturer replaced the first unit after I complained, but it was no improvement.  This may be the best product of its type out there, but it still comes up short.\n"

I live near metro st. louis and i could not hold a signal ANYWHERE!  I always had some intereference.  whether it was fuzz or the signal going in and out.  This product did not meet my expectations, especially since the back of the package states I should have crystal clear sound.  This is not true.

aS'\tListen to the rest of us\n\tI have to say, since I really started listening to music I have payed attention to a lot more detail of sound.  With that said I am not a bass junky; but bass and compression of the overall mix is what makes a sound a good sound.  I currently owned a pair of Sony MDR-EX81LP (that cost me 30-40 dollars a year ago) I am a medical student and I study all day and all night, but cannot have my music blasting.  Conversely I needed to have a nice isolation of my sound.  Comparing my old Sony to the new ER-6 that I just got, I am EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED with their performance.  I was expecting a great sound with minimal noise from the outside and get almost no response at the level that I studied with my old ear buds. To be fair remember that these are not noise cancelling, they are noise reducing.  There is no component involved here, they are basically really good earplugs with speakers in them.  My wife just ran the vacuum and I barely heard it.  The earplug reduced noise feature is great and comfortable; however my other ones (Sony earbuds) sound better.  A combination of the two would be great.  Keep in mind that this is my opinion and make your own based on why you are buying earbuds.  Environmental sound reduction is great, sound quality is not as good as some others.....choose your fault and pay attention to pricing.\n'

aS'\tPhantom Paper Jam can cost extra\n\tI have had the 325 model for less than a year.  Up until recently I was satisfied with its performance using it to print less than 5 pictures at a time.  Recently, I needed to print a series of pictures (more than 10 in one sitting) and had an error message-print cartridge jam-I fixed the paper jam but continued to get the error message. I  called HP and they stated this was a fatal error in the unit and encouraged me to purchase the updated model rather than fix my printer.  I searched the internet for a solution only to find that others had encountered this and the solution was to purchase the "new\'model- A not very cost effective solution as this was not supposted to be a disposable model.\n'

Then, I went to different Sony Stores, but the only answer they gave me was that my Memory Stick is failed, that it\'s impossible to fix or format it and, the worst, there is no way to save the pictures !!!!\n\nFinally, I tried to solved it by myself, and I "google" the C:13:01 error. If you do it, you will find hundreds of people with the same problem, looking for a solution.\n\nThat\'s why I don\'t recommend this product.

aS"\tGreat  features, great price, horrible speakerphone\n\tThis machine is  great looking, compact, and  seems to be the perfect combination fax/answering machine/speakerphone.  One major problem:  The phone is well below average in sound quality,  and the speaker is absolutely terrible.  The tiny, poorly made speaker is placed in the back left side of the unit and and is totaly inaudible at loud volumes due to distortion.  The fax is great,  the print quality is great,  the speed is great, but you have to lower the volume and lean over with your head against the speaker  to hear messages.  This problem also renders the speakerphone useless.  I returned this unit twice thinking it was defective, but spoke to HP and was told that is just the way this unit works.  Buy the Panasonic KX-FHD351  if you  need a great sounding unit.  The only problem with the Panasonic is that it doesn't come in black,  but is a much better phone/answering/speakerphone.\n"

Amazon MUST learn that this is illegal and they must ship all the orders placed, if they made a mistake pricing the item is THEIR problem not ours and more after many customers confirmed the price over telephone.

aS'\tMassive problems with Sony CE595\n\tI am sorry to say that my experience with the CD player has been miserable. After a series of unhelpful conversations with SONY folks, I am going to return it. It often fails to read the CD or cuts in and out on new CDs that play perfectly in other CD players; the shuffle program simply spins and spins, and rarely settles down to actually play a CD.  It occasionally generates a read error message (uh, yeah...).\n\nEven if on "continuous" play, it often fails to recognize the CDs loaded into it. Instead, it displays a "No Disc" message. Then, even if it does play a series of CDs on continuous play, at some pt, it just stops. It has been like this since I first brought it home and has not improved in the weeks since. \n  \nThe experience with the tech support people alone convinced me that they do not care.  It took a long time to even get through their tech support lines the first night I had it, and then a lot of persuading to even get them to agree that their CD player was not working. Then they tried to convince to me send the brand new machine back, **for a price**, to have them repair it. Uh, no, not likely to fall for that--paying them to repair a brand new machine straight out of the box, taking time out of my way-too-busy life to ship it to them??  I finally have a reference number with permission to return it to the store for a full refund; so back it goes.\n \nThen there are the limitations on the remote control that others here have noted. \n\nSince I had the same shuffle problems with my previous SONY carousel player, I am not inclined to try a 3rd machine. \n\nNeedless to say, no more SONYs are coming into my life.\n'

A new firmware (1.23) was released a few days ago for revision A (the version of the router I have).  D-Link\'s website said the firmware "improved reliability" so I decided to upgrade.  After flashing to the new firmware, the router will not let me into the control panel  or respond to pings.  The lights blink, that\'s all.  I\'ve reset the router, but this does nothing to restore the old firmware.  D-link\'s firmware upgrade appears to have put this router out of its misery--which is perhaps for the best as it now forces me to finally go back to a reliable router company\n'

aS'\tBelow Average Sound Using FM Wireless Signal; Also, cancelling service is a joke\n\tThis review is more about my several month\'s experience with XM satellite radio and the not-so-good quality using the wireless FM frequencies through our car\'s radios. I live in Los Angeles.\n\nI got this little Roady XT for me, and the XM2GO radio receiver for my wife. I was excited about getting these new satellite receivers in our cars. The Idea of having all these "no ads" radio stations playing through my car\'s FM frequency seemed cool. \n    Setting up the unit and getting it to work was easy. Changing FM frequencies for the wireless transmitter is easy as well. It really is a neat little receiver. \n\nHowever, after setting up this unit in my car and the XM2GO in my wife\'s car, I was really disappointed in the music sound quality. The music sounds flat and with a hissy quality, almost monaural at times, and the volume seems a lot lower than the car\'s radio at the same volume setting. I had to turn the volume dial up quite a bit when playing satellite radio. The car\'s regular radio sounds much better than satellite radio if using wireless reception with any of the radio receivers, IMO. Besides, there are plenty of annoying ads and interruptions on XM radio as someone mentioned in another review.\n    \nI thought about having the units professionally installed so that my wife and I wouldn\'t have to use the poor sounding wireless FM technology, but realized that both family cars have very expensive navigation systems and I didn\'t want the vehicle\'s factory warranty voided if some installer got inside our car\'s dash and accidentally messed something up.\n\nSo about two month\'s ago, after several months of off-and-on use of XM radio service, I called to cancel my subscriptions. I had paid for a six month subscription for both receivers when I joined. As I expected would happen, when I called them to cancel, I was on the phone for allloooooonnnng time waiting for a customer service rep. Finally, I got to tell the rep all my relevant account information so I could cancel the service only to be put on hold and transferred to their "special" customer service department for cancellations where I was "accidentally" disconnected and had to call back and start all over again.\n\nFinally, after another long call to them, I was able to cancel my service.....or, so I thought. Yesterday, I was looking at my September credit card bill and saw that XM radio had charged my credit card for the next six months despite the fact that they assured me that my two accounts would be closed. \n\nI called my bank and had them reverse the charges and I may have the bank issue me a new credit card with different numbers in case XM tries to charge me again six months from now.\n'

When I saw the new energizer 2500mAh rechargeables I was excited to purchase them thinking they would last longer than my old 1600mAh Rayovacs.  Boy was I wrong!\n\nFor 2-3 months, the 2500mAh energizers worked well. A charge lasted about 6-7 hours in my portable GPS unit. I was getting roughly 5.5-6 hours on my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA's. My GPS unit is spec'ed for 6 hours on a pair of AA's so the new 2500mAh energizers seemed to work flawlessly.\n\nNow they work okay and seem to be getting worse each time I charge them, appearing to hold less of a charge each time.  For the last month or two (4th  and  5th month after their initial purchase) I'll be lucky if I can get 4-5 hours of use out of them in my portable GPS unit. I now get roughly 3.5-4 hours of use out of them.  I pulled out and tried my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA's and once again got approximately 5.5-6 hours of use out of them in my GPS unit - and my trusty Rayovacs are just over 2 years old!\n\nI thought I might have had some defective energizers but I can't seem to get any pair of combinations to hold a decent charge. Charges just don't seem to last - it's really disappointing.  I am going to look at another brand for high capacity 2500+ mAh NiMH batteries to replace my 1600mAh Rayovacs. Would be great if the energizer could hold its charge. But because they don't, I do not recommend the energizers to anyone\n"

aS"\tGood sound, when they stay on my ears.\n\tI had such high hopes for these headphones.  I wanted to hook them over my ears and go running whenever I pleased.  But it was not to be. \n\nThe day after I received my headphones, my grandmother passed away.  I packed my bags, put my idpod and headphones in my carry-on, and headed to the airport.  Once settled in my seat, I tried to put on my headphones, but they kept falling off my ears.  I tried to adjust them, bending the earclips all sorts of ways, but it was extremely difficult to do so, and my adjustments wouldn't hold.\n\nIf I couldn't get these headphones to stay on when I was stationary, running was out of the question. \n\nMaybe others have had better luck.  Maybe my ears are just too small for them.  But I am not impressed with these headphones\n"

aS"\tOne word - LOUSY\n\tYou would think that Panasonic Cordless phone and Panasonic Hands-Free Headset would work well together, being that they are sold by the same company. Well, that is clearly not the case. I bought this headset specifically for the reason that it is sold by Panasonic to work with their cordless phones. I've tried it a few times and each time I get the same response from the person I'm talking to. They say I sound too far away, that they can barely hear me. This product is clearly not worth it\n"

aS'\twg311v2\n\tTerrible product.  I have tried using the Windows XP wireless application with just the netgear drivers and tried using the Netgear wireless application with the netgear drivers.  Using either one the card disconnects at random using WPA, then you have to repair the connection and sometimes reboot to get the connection back.  I reinstalled windows both times I changed drivers just to make sure nothing was conflicting with it, but nothing helped.  Latest drivers are 2_0_0_7 and were published in Nov 2004, so netgear has moved on to other cards and is not supporting this one any longer\n'

p476
aS'\tGood sound, terribly uncomfortable\n\tDo not get these headphones, as they are way too tight. I have been using them for a month now, hoping they would break in more, but they have not. You can only have them on for 20 minutes or so before your ears hurt so bad you have to take them. Im not sure why they made them so tight, but they would probably best fit a 10 year old.\n'

aS"\tWhy the Zboard isn't worth it\n\tI bought the Zboard and was sorely disappointed in it's playbility, efficiency and value for several reasons:\n\n-The left buttons, which are the feature of the keyboard, are based on a mirroring system.  You experience keyboard lag at times because the board has to interpret the button presses based on the zboard program, then the game.  I personally had to press some buttons twice, or even three times in order for that command to register.\n\n-The left buttons cannot be configured to your game, you must configure the game to it.  The templates for different games cannot be modified, all it does is change the button configuration.  There are no patches for configuring the keys to how you want it.\n\n-According to the website, the top buttons for media can only be used with windows media player.  If you use winamp, itunes, or anything else it wont work.  \n\n-You cannot program any macros into any of the buttons.  If you are looking for a keyboard that can autofire or program keystrokes this isn't it.  \n\n- The numpad is configured differently than a normal keyboard.  This can actually be a good thing if you like having a compacted pad.  I found it frustrating since I put attack commands on the numbers, and would press the wrong one sometimes because of the layout.\n\nI experienced a lot of frustration with this controller while pvping in world of warcraft.  The top buttons on the left side of the board give you access to a bigger arsenal of spells and abilities when programmed right.  The problem is remembering how zboard configured the button layout.  I would constantly get wailed on because a button wasn't where I originally remembered it to be.  This forced me to sit in the key bindings menu to configure the buttons to where I could remember.  After completely revamping my bindings, I gave up, restored my defaults, and used a regular keyboard instead.\n\nThere is nothing gaming enhancing about this keyboard beyond having an accessory on the left side that looks cool because the buttons are grey and red and contoured to your hand.  \n\nTo achieve the same effect as the zboard, turn your current keyboard slightly to the right and enjoy.\n"

aS"\tHummmmmmmmmmmmmmm...\n\tI picked these speakers up because the price was right and they sounded great in the store. But I get them home to my quiet house and lo and behold the subwoofer constantly hums. I'm not an audiophile and therefore not overly particular about sound... other than this annoying hum from the subwoofer. Since these are set up in my home office where I spend a lot of time reading, I find this humming far too distracting. Although the price is good, I'd prefer to pay a little more just to omit the subwoofer's constant hum.\n\nI'm returning these speakers today and will shop around for another set\n"

aS"\tFirmware Buggy\n\tCan not get this thing to connect to my Linksys Wireless router.  Problem is not that it doesn't see the LinkSys, the problem is that the v2.50 firmware in the WLI-TX4-G54HP is _buggy_.  If I try to enter a 10-digit hex key for 64-bit WEP encryption-- it says I have to enter a 5-digit value.  This is the 2nd one I bought (I returned the first).

aS'\tHorrible, horrible, horrible\n\tI adore my nano, but this armband is one of the worst products I have ever bought.  I work out quite a bit with the nano and the band comes off multiple times during my workout.  The spacing of the velcro dots means I never get exactly the right fit and the band gets ripped off anytime I do weight lifting close to my body.    It is also as other reviewers mentioned hugely overpriced for what it is.  I am ordering a band from a different company and this will go straight to the garbage.\n'

aS'\tGreat cables, until one of the colors goes out!\n\tI bought these cables, brought them home and immediatly hooked them up.  I set the PS2 for component and set my TV for it as well.  And  it looked awesome....for about 2 weeks.  Then the short in the cables caused only the blue and green colors to work making everything look creepy.  It would just fade back and forth until it just stop and the TV would have all the colors washed out in green.\n\nI found that I could stick a PS2 case under the cables at the base and it went away.  But sometimes someone would move the case and it would come back.  \n\nI have the PStwo (Small version) and the PS2... the small version has the problem, but the large one doesnt.  So dont get them if you have the small version... The large one works fine.\n'

aS'\tHow to get lost! Over..\n\tThe 350C is well packaged with almost current programming. It only got me lost eleven (11) times on a 865 mile trip:All cities in Georgia - Tybee Island to Pine Mountain to Newnan to Stone Mountain and return to Tybee Island. (I packed and returned the unit the day after getting home.) It may suit others well, but I can not rely on the unit. Four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized. Five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences. (One wrong turn took me sixty miles out of the way.)Two were for unknown reasons. The unit seems to take forever to acquire available satellites. Instructions are clear, but preferred views automatically switch to "Map" even when not wanted. I need a faster reacting unit that allows programming while enroute to a destination (by a passanger, of course.\n'

aS"\tThree Units in Three Weeks!\n\tI bought this unit on a wim.  I was leaving for a business trip and needed a GPS.  I really like it and it worked well for me.  Unfortunalty the unit wouldn't hold a charge on the battery.  So I returned it for another one.  It worked for one week and then I had the same exact problem.  Which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units.  When I tried to return this unit, the unit I was given didn't work at all, it gave me an error message when the GPS booted up.  Unfortunaltey the vendor I purchased it from didn't have any more units that I could exchange it for.  So I called customer service and got an RAN.  I am hoping when I get the next unit back in 7 to 10 days that I don't have any more problems\n"

aS'\tGreat picture -- when signal doesn\'t drop\n\tAll HDMI cables are created equal...well, yes and no.  While the signal is 100% digital (which means that $20  and  $150 cables give the exact same picture quality), it doesn\'t mean that each HDMI cable type gives the same rejection of noise (signal to noise ratio) as other HDMI cables.\nI\'ve had this cable a few weeks now, and am consistently getting digital "dropouts" every now and again (only that part of the image looks scrambled for a few seconds) -- very annoying while the action is in the scrambled section.  Went out and bought the Monster HDMI cable (not exactly cheap, though...) -- the Monster cable gives the exact same picture quality as this cable, except the Monster cable did not experience the digital "dropouts".\nIf you don\'t mind seeing the dropouts every now and again, this is a great cable.  If you want a picture that doesn\'t experience any dropouts, get the Monster cable.  Regardless, the picture quality is the exact same between the cables (minus the dropouts)\n'

It is a tremendous ripoff to buy an AC adapter seprately (and at $30), but then again, I'm sure Apple is making a ton off of this gimic, but I refuse to contribute. I can see not including a dock, A/V cables, etc, as those aren't   essential iPod accessories. But an AC adapter? Come on. Bad Apple. Bad!\n\nOn the plus side, this AC adapter is smaller and comes with an iPod to charger (or iPod to computer) cable, which the previous model did not include. It's still a ripoff, though\n"

aS'\tNice features, but can\'t compete with Cox DVR\n\tI have been a DVR user through Cox Cable for approx. 1 yr, and have always been disappointed.  I have kept my eye on Tivo for some time, and when my DVR box went out for the 2nd time, I decided it was time to try Tivo.  I got a refurbished Series2 DVR that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for $12.95 per month. \n\nI received the Tivo only 2 days after I ordered, very impressive since I didn\'t pay to have it shipped that quickly.  The setup was reasonably straight forward.  I had heard so much about Tivo that I had very high expectations, and here are the problems I encountered that surprised me:\n\n1)  My first mistake was not recognizing that you have to get a Dual tuner unit to be able to record 2 seperate programs (DVR does this automatically).  So I ordered the wrong unit.  To be honest, I don\'t see how this service is very useful at all with only a single tuner, my family relies on dual tuners A LOT.  I am shocked that Tivo even offers a single tuner system, to me it\'s like a tricycle compared to a 10 speed, a dual tuner is so much more useful.  \n\n2)  I thought I would be able to hook up a wireless receiver to connect to my home network.  No, you have to buy theirs for $40 to $50.  Since I didn\'t know that, I had to rely on the phone line option.  This really stinks, it is very very very slow.  I spent 2 hrs trying to download one days programming, the system kept getting interuppted during download (yes I disabled call waiting).  \n\n3)  When you use the online program guide, it covers up the entire screen.  My Cox DVR puts the TV in upper right corner (approx. 1/4) asnd the rest of the screen lets you see the guide.  We use this all of the time to see if there is anything better on, but that won\'t work so well with Tivo.  Plus, scrolling up and down is painfully slow, the screen takes for ever to refresh.\n\n4)  Similarly to item 3 above, when you review recorded programs the show you are watching is turned off completely, you can only see the Tivo guide.  Again, Cox DVR lets me look at my list and delete files etc.. all while my TV program stays visible in the upper right corner.  \n\n5)  Remote wouldn\'t work with my 42" Akai plasma.  I can\'t fault Tivo too much on this one, none of the universal remotes seem to work with this TV for some reason.  \n\n\nI did love some of the Tivo features and wish my Cox DVR had them:\n1)  Wishlist\n2)  Tivo Suggestions\n3)  Can access your Tivo through internet\n4)  View photo\'s through Tivo.\n\nIn the end my items # 3 and 4 were things I just couldn\'t get past, so I returned my Tivo.  They were friendly and helpful and I really wanted to like this product, but in my opinion it\'s not able to compete with the speed and power of the Cable companies DVR.\n'

aS"\tJunk, sorry Panasonic\n\tI bought a lot of Panasonic stuff in the past without any problems but the picture quality on this thing is awful, even at the highest quality setting. All I saw were blocky artifacts that seemed to be blinking. I even had the DNR (digital noise reduction) enabled and it didn't help. Most recordings skipped and stuttered at the beginning. I took it back for refund and Best Buy told me this model is known for doing that. I don't see how Panasonic can put their name on this junk. Those cheap $99 recorders you find at Walmart have better quality than this.\n"

So it was in the locked position but the combination is still the one I had set. I tried so many combinations 'around' mine but obviously there are so many different possibilites. The fact that I even have to try to think of what combination my lock decided to change itself to today makes this a lock I can't rely on\n"

aS'\tLow quality networking solution for low budget.\n\tI initially chose this router because of its low price. Sometimes, you get what you pay for, and that is exactly what happened to me. As a wired router, this works well enough. It connects four computers to the internet. Just don\'t do anything to intense with it, and you should be fine. I noticed that when I view video media, the connection totally freezes. But for basic internet and downloading, it works.\n\nI generally find, however, that no one buys a "wireless" router not to use wireless, and that is where the problem is. The receiver is so painfully finicky, it does not keep connections. The configuration of this router is about as easy as brain surgery. The linksys support team tries to be helpful, but I can\'t seem to make this router reliable. It drops reception all the time. Many times my laptop won\'t even detect a signal. The wireless performance of this router is abysmal. \n\nI sincerely hope that if you have this router, it is working flawlessly for you. I can\'t get it to work well for me not matter what I do. The difficulty that I am having with this equipment is so bad that I am going to replace it as soon as I can.\n'

aS"\tGood in theory... major issues in practice\n\tI've been using my BEFW11S4 for a few months now. The little thing has its good points - a nice, unobtrusive little box I can just plug in and hide on top of some piece of office furniture, allowing my rather over-laptop-equipped household some nice convenient net access, while still allowing the home office systems a wired connection.\n\nSounds nice, if it only worked. Howver, BEFW11S4 has a MAJOR problem, and a rather common one at that. Specifically, it locks up. It does so frequently. I have to unplug the router at least once a day, and frequently twice, to deal with it locking up. Can't even access the administrator screen, and even hitting the reset button isn't enough to fix it. Wireless isn't too useful when you have to physically walk to the unit multiple times a day, is it?\n\nThe problem seems to lie not in the hardware, but in the firmware (the software that runs on the router). If Linksys would release reliable firmware for this router, I'd give it 4-5 stars. But until they resolve the issue that wires down their wireless modem, I can't possibly justify giving the BEFW11S4 more then two stars\n"

aS"\tFrustrating Item\n\tThe first Vista Cx I purchased died after only 3 days of use. I returned it to Amazon who immediately and painlessly replaced it.  The second unit lasted for 4 days until I fell waist deep into a stream with the unit in my pocket. Though it was only submersed for a matter of seconds it immediately stopped working and water was seen internally around the screen. Garmin's claim of waterproofness for 1m for 10 minutes is utter baloney. The poorly designed T-style lock on the battery case cannot possibly assure water integrity from anything beyond high humidity. I probably wouldn't buy buy another Garmin but I'm stuck with them as I have already invested $200 in proprietary MapSource software.  I guess that was their plan.\nOn the plus side, the Vista Cx did seem to function as it should...for all of 7 days\n"

aS"\tUnbelievable Piece of Junk without real Support\n\tThis is the best sounding PC speaker system available. Absolutley stellar sound quality--for how long is a serious problem. I too own 2 of these systems. After eleven months of bliss my first amp also went out. \n\nI call Klipsch technical support, and they explain I can send it in but the amp is backordered for 4-6 weeks. So I buy another one from Amazon and thier retailer Beach Audio, Inc., not having 4-6 weeks to wait for bliss to return. \n\nSo get this please, not $360 plus tax once, but twice, and add 2 occurances of overnight shipping at $125 per, for a total spend of $970 plus tax!!!\n\nWell blow me down but the replacement for amp #1 hasen't even showed up, and 6 working days of bliss later? You guessed it amp #2 fails. Klipsch, well they obviously picked quite a piece of crap for an amp. They stand behind the product though--I have another RMA to send to the fine people at the Klipsch return center.\n\nThe retailer this site uses, Beach Audio Inc., offered me my money back, but would offer no replacement of any sort, and no refund for the $125 shipping charge. Nothing they wanted to do would help me get a working product. They refered me to Klipsch without mercy, or even lube.\n\nNow Klipsch makes some fine home audio (my Klipschhorns are 15 years old, have been rocked to death, and still sound awesome), and this ProMedia Ultra unit sounds fabulous--so I may do business with them again (perhaps not the PC Multimedia division), but I vow to never give another red cent to Amazon's retailer Beach Audio, Inc.. They were uncooperative, unsympathetic, curt, short, unprofessional, and ultimately completely useless when contacted about the failure.\n\nPLEASE LOOK ELSWHERE FOR YOUR NEXT PC MULTIMEDIA PURCHASE!!!!!!!

aS'\tBoth Klipsch Subwoofers Died\n\tThe first subwoofer died (no sound) after 6 days.  Remember, the sub powers all the speakers in this system.  I sent it back to the company I bought it from and they were nice enough to take care of "Klipsch\'s faulty product".  They asked me if I would like a refund and like an idiot I said, "No, just send me another one".  The replacement Klipsch system arrived and it played great for about 14 months and then NOTHING.  No power from the sub!  Same problem but now my warranty is up.  Klipsh has a way of designing things to work just past the warranty.  Shame on Klipsch for making such a shoddy product.  Shame on me for asking for a replacement and getting burned twice.  Heed all these warnings my friends.  I would buy used speakers at a garage sale before I would buy another Klipsh product.

aS'\tSound great.... but stop working!\n\tThese speakers do sound great but just like many others who have reviewed these speakers, they eventually just stop working. It sounds like I was one of the lucky ones as mine lasted two years. But I really didn\'t use them all that much and I don\'t blast the volumes. When you spend this kind of many on a product it should at least last 5 years or so. I\'ve never had any other speaker brand just stop working on me before. Worse of all is to hear that Klipsch is charging a lot of money to repair their faulty products  and that people had problems with them even after they were "repaired". Well, I\'m not wasting time and money on repairing them. I\'m just switching to Logitech. No more Klipsch ever again for me.\n'

aS"\tGood idea but not ready yet, doesn't work, unreliable\n\tI like other Lacie drives I've used very much, thought I'd take a chance on this, but it just does not work.  It takes me about a hundred swipes on average to get the biometric sensor to work...That is keeping data a bit TOO secure to be helpful.  Also there have been reports of complete data loss by others,but I've not had that experience - could be I just haven't been able to GET to my data enough to find out.  Support from Lacie was completely unhelpful (wash your hands and the sensor before swiping which I have already done dozens of times was the only suggestion).  If the drive could be partioned so you could have a secure partition and an easier to access partion, the failure of biometrics would not be so serious, but as is, I would definitely not purchase this again, and I would strongly advise against it unless there is some kind of firmware or other improvement\n"

aS'\tEasily Scratched w/Very Limited Lifespan\n\tYou\'d think that a Palm screen protector from Palm would be best in class. However, these Palm "premium" screen protectors have a lifespan of about 3-4 days at best. I\'m very careful with my new Palm TX, yet under normal use the stylus easily scratches the screen protector to such an extent that the device no longer accurately recognizes stylus input. I also dislike having to cut the screen protectors to size. I\'ve tried an Invisible Shield screen protector, and it was tough as nails; the problem was that installation was difficult, and the tacky surface also produced input errors. Next I\'m trying a Boxwave ClearTouch. I never had this sort of problem with the old Fellowes WriteRight protector, which lasted a year or more on my old Palm m130\n'

aS'\tmore Monster snake oil...\n\tMonster Cable and its similarly overpriced imitators are a triumph of hype over substance, and ruthlessly exploits the consumer\'s naivete and trust in shady audio/video salespeople.  \n\nYes, for most things you DO "get what you pay for"---but when it comes to speaker cables, interconnects, and other a/v wiring however it\'s another story.  \n\nAll you need for optimal sound is any 12 to 16 gauge generic cable which you can buy at Home Depot for a fraction of the cost.  \n\nSave your money for things like speaker stands, which really do make a world of difference\n'

aS"\tDO NOT BUY THIS CARD IF YOU USE WINDOWS 98SE\n\tI AM DISGUSTED TO REALIZE THAT ALTHOUGH CRUCIAL MARKETS THIS CARD AS COMING WITH A DRIVER FOR WIN98SE, IT DOES NOT.  THE CD IT CAME WITH DID NOT HAVE A DRIVER (although it said it did) THE WEB SIGHT DOES NOT HAVE DRIVERS AND AFTER TWO PROMISES ON THE PHONE FROM CRUCIAL TECH SUPPORT PROMISING TO SEND ME ONE, I STILL DON'T HAVE IT.

aS"\tWorked for Seven Minutes, Then Quit\n\tWhen I plugged these in they worked fine for about seven minutes, then the speaker's internal power simply cut off. Happened on the AC adapter or batteries, whether I was using my computer or my iPod as the sound source. Same behavior every time. \n\nLogitech sent me a replacement from a new production run, same thing happened. Sent it back to Logitech on my nickel, got another replacement from same production run (Product ID: A612). Same problem.\n\nAfter two months and many long waits for Logitech tech support, I'm giving up. Maybe it was just a bad run, or maybe my environment is flukey, but I'm sorry I ever bought this thing\n"

aS"\tweak sound unless you have a headphone amp\n\tThe Koss Pro4AAT headphones are quality headphones, but sounds weak when driven through a regular headphone jack from your receiver or tv.  To get the great sounds that everyone else seems to rave about, you really need to run these headphones through a headphone amp.  Also, the ear pads are of a vinyl-like material which doesn't breathe well, making it uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.  I've read that leatherette pads are available, but so far haven't been able to find them.  The warranty alone is great, but I wouldn't recommend these headphones unless you have a headphone amp\n"

aS'\tUnreliable...don\'t get lulled w/false sense of security\n\tDevice unexpectedly stopped working after 9 months.

Bullet-proof case is great gimick, but this device is unreliable as a backup for "road" files.  Might be better off using your PDA with a large SD card\n'

aS"\tworked for 30 days - microphone broke\n\tI had one that worked for a year that came with the original phone. Then, I just ordered this one from Amazon and it worked for 30 days. Like other reviews you see here, people started not being able to hear me, but I could hear them. So the microphone broke. But, I called Uniden tech support and they recommended I replace the battery on the phone for $37. So, I just ordered a new phone and tested the headset -- sure enough it wasn't the phone -- it was the headset. A costly mistake. I would not buy this headset again. Also, Amazon has a 30 day return policy, so if it breaks, make sure you return it within that 30 days or you are stuck with it\n"

aS'\tGS not as good as the original\n\tI just bought a new RatpadzGS to replace my four year old ratpadz. Compaired to the old Ratpad, the RatpadzGS is made with a lower density Cheap-O(tm) plastic and tracks poorly with my logitech G7 mouse. When using the mouse on the GS it causes the curser to sort of stutter along. Overall I would pass on this product, for now my desk actually works better than this mousepad.\n'

aS"\tSo-so at best.\n\tIt was an okay mousepad for approximately a year and a half.  Every so often, my optical mouse jittered from one edge of the screen to the other when left stationary, but I encountered no serious problems.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that might have been indicative of a greater problem with the mousepad.  It is all one color.  The grooves have all worn away on a large portion of the pad, and now my mouse won't budge.  I'm in the process of looking for an alternative right now\n"

aS"\tCan't get it to work.\n\tThe Netgear wireless router product is apparently in working order because I mailed it to my son in Tennessee who got it to work just fine on his equipment which is the same as mine. Surely, I'm not so technically savvy as my son, but I can read and write and follow directions. The setting up of the equipment is quite complicated, in my view, far moreso than it should be. I've set up other peripherals with success, but this product is more than I can handle. I've followed the directions, over and over, and still the router doesn't connect. I've given up. Can't handle the frustration. By the way, I'm way over the age of 13. I have grandchildren over the age of 13.\n"

aS"\tWireless printing problems\n\tAfter a bit of sweat I've managed to get the printer working fine from both my XP and MAC OS Tiger computers  ...... until I unplug the direct ethernet cable to the router that is needed for set-up.  Then nothing happens i.e. no wireless printing.\n\nI suspect it's an IP addressing issue having read a helpful article here (take note D-link - Amazon is becoming a better support site than your own!).  Changing the IP address messes up my internet connection during install; the MAC works quite hard to re-establish the internet connection  and  perhaps this breaks the connection to the printer? I dunno, but it's giving me a headache.\n\nDocumentation  and  troublshooting help are very, very weak  and  time will tell if D-link on-line support are any better (22 hours  and  no response from them yet....)\n\nI'm sure network wizards will have this little beasty up  and  running in no time, but for normal people it's, well, a bit of a pain\n"

aS'\tGarbage!- It does not work with most USB printers\n\tI contacted D-Link support and they verified that this product was tested and worked with a very minimum number of popular USB printers (I believe the number was around 30-40).\nThe D-Link DP-G321 Wireless Print server did not work with any of the 3 USB printers I owned (Lexmark Z320, HP PSC 1250, HP Photosmart 7310). It worked okay with my one parallel HP Laserjet 1100 and I was able to connect it to my network and install the print server, but it was not at all compatible with my printers which was key. It this product was more compatible, I would have rated it 4 stars, because the installation was very easy and almost worry-free, plus it was very sensitive to the wireless radio waves i.e. it sensed my secured wireless network when other print server could not in that same location.\nI returned the D-Link and bought instead a Linksys WPS54GU2 print server that worked with all of my printers, but it was not as sensitive as the D-Link DP-G321, so I had to move my printers and print server closer to my wireless access point\n'

aS'\tWhoa!!!  Apples and Oranges\n\tSeveral reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace  a composite (L/R audio + video) cable, or an S-video (multi-pinned plug). ALmost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the TV uses different internal circuitry for each one. Virtually any S-video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable, and any component (individual R-G-B video) connection will be better than S-video. Cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it. There may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another, but its almost always unnoticable\n'

aS"\tGood Printer but drops the internet connection\n\tI was in the market to upgrade my printer and used Amazon's reviews to decide on a Canon MP530. It does a good job, but when I plug the USB cord into the printer, the connection to the Internet drops every time. I have to disconnect from the printer so I can get on-line. Recently I filled out a rather lengthy application on the Internet and plugged in the USB cable so I could print. That step caused the connection to drop and I got to reenter all the information. I will be returning the Canon MP530 and start my search for another all-in one printer\n"

aS"\tPricey for the length\n\tAfter seeing a wide range in the prices for HDMI cables, I did some research into why is it. Found out that these cables carry digital signals (0's and 1's), so no matter what kind of fancy name you add before this cable, its basic purpose is simple like a cat5 cable. Then I went ahead and bought the cheaper ones which are working perfectly fine. So, dont be fooled by the high price cables. There is no special sheilding  and %*p in them. Its all misleading marketing. For this length of cable, I would pay maybe $5\n"

So, I exchanged it for a new one, and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again, it would freeze up, and would only play 5 seconds of every song. What I liked about it, for the small amount of time I had it was the sound quality, the choice in colors, and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space.  I'm not sure I would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days.  Now I have an Iriver Clix and have had no problems.

And has once needed the main system/circuit board replaced.  We'd purchased this back when it cost about $125 more than it does now.  And the parts have not been quickly available from some vendors.

Unfortunately, that can be said of most units.  I've had good Brother machines in the past, and probably will buy another, better, Brother fax.

Not only is the rate of a successful DVD burn very low (movies, games, etc.), it also has a horrible shelf life that lasts for about four months. From what I hear from other members, Memorex uses a low-quality dye, and is explicitly evident in the red colored deterioration of the dye that can be seen on the top layer of the disk. All my DVD+R's are actually stained RED for some reason?!? Overall, go with verbatim or heck, even COMPUSA dvd's will be more suffice than this garbage\n"

aS'\tnot for programmers!\n\tI recently bought this keyboard to go along with a fancy ergonomic laptop stand.  The stand puts the laptop screen at a reasonable height for use on a desktop -- that works great.  The keyboard, however, is fairly awful, and I\'m returning it.\n\nI realize I shouldn\'t expect much for $20, but the keyboard has an exceptionally soft, mushy feeling.  The "comfort type" slanted keys didn\'t get in my way, but they didn\'t help anything, either.  The worst part about this keyboard, however, was that it uses a non-standard layout.  Look closely at the right side -- the "enter" key is oversized, and the |\\ key is moved below to accomodate it, with the consequence that the right shift key is miniaturized.\n\nThis, for a shell user or programmer, is awful.  When you need to pipe something, or escape the next character, you really don\'t mean to be hitting return instead.  And with the small right shift key, even typing properly with balanced use of the keyboard is difficult.  This small design decision makes this keyboard terrible for heavy computer users like me\n'

aS'\tWorked at first but....\n\tI bought this item about two months ago and was happy as can be. No more equipment in the tv room! About two weeks ago though, I noticed that the unit was slower and slower and I had to hit buttons repeatedly to get things done. It has eventually gotten to the point that it does not work at all. At first I thought it was batteries in the remote, so I replaced those a few times. Then I thought the placement of the IR transmitter was off, so I moved it closer to my AV rack. That worked at first, but the problem persisted so I reprogrammed, but to no avail. Eventually I narrowed it down to the remote unit. Even with the remote RIGHT NEXT TO THE IR Transmitter, it now does not work most of the time. Of course the real problem now is that all my av stuff is in a different room, so standard IR remotes (why do they even make those still????) are out of the question. I will be moving onto something else and keep my fingers crossed. \nAlong the way I learned a few other things...other reviewers are right in that the memory gets eaten up quickly when you have to program the unit (which I do with a new LG DVD player). In theory, this is a great unit and the remote is very good when it comes to commands. In practice, however, all it did was make me hungry for an RF system that will work more consistently.\n'

aS"\tGood player but  very poor construction\n\tMy player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had, which ended up rendering it useless (out of warranty).  \n\nHowever, while it worked, I was quite pleased with the player and the included software.  Everything was intutive and ran smoothly (except for an occational freeze with the player which never became frequent enough to be a major burden).  I also liked the fact that this player wasn't bound by iTunes or file format restrictions.\n\nMy only other complaint was that occasionally the touchpad made moving small increments like up one track or down one track somewhat difficult (just give me buttons, I know they aren't sexy but they're easy and work well).  \n\nI am giving the product 2 stars because, while I liked it, Creative has known about the headphones flaw for a long time and has not improved the build (being that this is STILL a problem with these players).  For the amount of money that a player like this costs, it should work for at least year\n"

I try upgrading the drivers and it refuses to connect to my network. I'm a network engineer and I am well versed in what I am doing, but this card has given me nothing but trouble. I had to disable the software that came with it and use the windows wireless software to connect.  This only keeps me alive for about 30 minutes before freezing.  I talked to netgear support and they tell me that my processor isn't supported, which is total BS and just an attempt to get out of supporting me, they wouldn't even let me return the product.

aS"\tPoor FM stereo\n\tThe first unit couldn't even find FM stereo stations. It had similar FM specs as the Sony ST_JX410 AM/FM Tuner it was replacing.  It was returned as a faulty unit. The replacement STRDE 197 was able to find stereo FM stations which played fine in monoral but were noisy in stereo. My 25 year old JX410 tuner did an excellent job on FM stereo stations. The second unit was returned for a refund. Sony's quality isn't what it use to be. I bought an Onkyo TX-SR304. The FM works fine with more features  and  expandability.\n"

aS"\tAn Inadequate Receiver\n\tI bought this receiver from Amazon,  and  received it about 10 days ago.  Since then, I've tried to play my cassettes of classical music.  When used for this purpose, this receiver sucks big time.  If I turn the volume loud enough to hear the orchestra playing softly, when the orchestra gets loud the amp shuts down  and  PROTECT flashes on  and  off.  I have to turn the receiver off, then turn it back on,  and  lower the volume.  Then of course when the music gets soft again, I can't hear it\n"

aS'\tHorrible crackling noise\n\tI bought one of these, it has a bad audio "crackling" noise on every mode except FM tuner (an obvious defect). Sounds like a capacitor going bad, not sure how it got through final test. \n\nPlus, the audio has noise when the display updates or the volume is changed. It also hangs on to stereo mode on weak signals with no blend or rolloff, you hear audio tones from the stereo decoder PLL losing lock from the station 19 KHz pilot tone.  AM section is not bad, but the FM selectivity is not good enough to block alternate stations that most of my other radios deal with just fine.  Volume steps are so small it takes forever to change, needs a flippin\' crank on the knob.  \n\nDon\'t buy this steaming turd.....buy a no-name China box, then you can throw it away when it claps out without feeling like you got scammed.\n'

aS'\tbroken latch, poor hinge design\n\tAs others have reported, my latch broke as well, but I broke it within three days of ownership.  Within a month, I cracked the bit of plastic that is supposed to hold the palm in place when I was removing it from the case to sync it.  At the time, the case had so many gashes and dings that it really looked unpresentable.  Bought a Rhinoskin to replace this.  Look elsewhere before you purchase this one\n'
p571
aS'\tProblems\n\tOK, so it protects the TX on a fall, however the latching mechanism depends on a thin piece of plastic that eventually breaks, rendering the case without anyway of remaining shut on its own.\n\nReplacing this with something like the BoxWave.com hardcase, availab le from Amazon\n'

aS'\tGreat Idea - Bad Design\n\tI was delighted with my ToughSkin for all of two hours. That\'s how long it took for the belt clip to break, rendering my new purchase worthless to me.\n\nThe ToughSkin itself is rugged; I loved it. I should have waited before buying it, though ... on my last visit to an Apple dealership, they had a bin full of *just the ToughSkins,* for sale at a discount. When I asked about these, I was told, "The belt clips break, and customers bring the ToughSkins back."\n\nI should note I\'m very careful with my IPod and accessories. I\'m not rough on them. The clip just fell apart while I was walking down the street. Given other comments about the flimsy clips, this is clearly a design issue that Speck Products needs to address\n'

aS"\tBad sounding headphones!\n\tI've been a fan of Sony earbuds for many years.  Due to the bad reviews of durability of the latest Sony earbuds, I decided on purchasing these Panasonic headphones. I bought these headphones because my Sony headphones died after 3 years and to upgrade my factory Creative Zen Micro headphones.  I found a perfect fit between the 3 size earplugs.  I've noticed that it does block out the sound in your surroundings.  It's good for that commute to work when there is a lot of noise.  I like the around the neck feature.  As far as quality, the extention part of the wiring looks durable but not the around the neck part of it.  As far as the performance of the headphones, I'm really disappointed in these headphones.  My factory Creative headphones had out performed these.  The bass level is too low even when I max out the bass in the player.  The mids and treble sound like crap. Don't waste your money on these!  Now I have to spend more money to replace these poor quality headphones!  argh!\n"

aS'\tThis product ruined our car battery and 2 Ipods\n\tWe tried the Belkin in one car. When we turned the Ipod on, the car battery immediately discharged (we had to buy a new car battery) and the Ipod died. We bought another Belkin and tried it in a different car and with a different Ipod (in case the first incident was a coincidence) and this Ipod died too. The Ipods were under warranty, the car battery was not. We tried this with 2 different Belkins, in 2 different cars with 2 different Ipods. I would not recommend this product to anyone.\n'

I was planning on using this for work, as I get a lot of DVD\'s from clients - so I popped one of those in and guess what?  It came up as "invalid disc".  It\'s supposed to play the majority of formats, and I triple checked the disc in my other dvd players, and it worked in my Panasonic DVD/VHS combo player.  A store-bought DVD worked fine (although I didn\'t play it much more than the first menu) so I know it\'s not broken.\n\nThe first reviewer also noticed that it doesn\'t play a bunch of homemade DVD\'s, so I will confirm that here - if that\'s gonna be a deal-breaker for you then stay away.  BTW, the DVD I was trying to play was made on a Philips burner.  I didn\'t bother to test it with any others\n'

aS'\tWaste of money!\n\tI spent $400 16 months ago on two very similar portable Audiovox DVD players for my kids, for long roadtrips.  They were handled with care, never abused or exposed to severe temperatures.  I think we got about 6 trips out of them, then the screens went blank while in use and both units died within 24 hours of each other.  Circuit City informed me the product is no longer on their shelves and referred me to Audiovox, who will do nothing since the product is now out of warranty.  Extended warranties are useless on this kind of product -- who can wait 6-8 weeks for repairs?  Parents, find another brand\n'

The first unit tracks pretty good, but the second units position is off a large percentage of the time and sometimes as much as 400 meters. I sent the faulty unit to Garmin to be repaired. They sent it back with a description of the problem and that it had been fixed. I checked the unit out and it is the same as when I sent it to them. Now I'm stuck with a dud\n"

The manual shows several different symbols that you should see in the LCD display, but none of these symbols appeared on this camera. I am returning the camera immediately and I would not advise anyone to purchase one.\n'

aS'\tPiece \'O\' Crap!!!!!\n\tI bought this so called "stereo" system at a Big Lot\'s Store for about $40.00. I figured since they were selling it there it must be a good deal, and it looked very cool too. It worked for about a month before it started skipping and remote was wigging out. It never sounded any better than one of those old plastic 45 record players. It looked good in my daughters bedroom but it lookes and sounds much better in the dumpster. I can\'t believe this company can get away with selling this worthless crap. I will never buy anything from them again\n'

aS"\tGood sound, not so good quality\n\tI've loved these headphones for the year or two I've had them.  I still love them now....  when they work.  The problem is that the cord is shoddy.  When I plug into my laptop I have a hard time keeping it working.  I have to twist the cord just right to get the sound to work.  If its not just right I'll get sound in only one ear, if at all.  I don't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk.  I don't think it has ever left my office and I don't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it.  Overall I like these things, but I'm just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit\n"

aV	Beware!\u000a	I ordered the Passport X50 from Amazon to save the $18 shipping Escort Radar was charging. I was told by someone at Escort Radar that Amazon was an authorized reseller.\u000a\u000aAfter having my detector on for ten minutes (right out of the box), it did three "SELF CAL"s, then said "SERVICE REQUIRED". I called Escort Radar and was told "If you let the car power up the unit when you start the car, the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused. You must first start the car, and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector." It makes some sense, but if this is really the case, why don't they put those instructions in their manual? After trying this many times, the unit was "still confused", so I returned it for a replacement.\u000a\u000aMy second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened. This time Escort Radar told me "if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night, this has been found to cause problems." Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition, so this doesn't apply. Escort Radar also told me that "excessive heat" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100\ufffd heat, and I'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun, but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car. It gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country. There are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90\ufffd or leaving it off in a hot car. You wouldn't design a ski that doesn't work below 35\ufffd, would you???\u000a\u000aThe most troubling part of my conversation with Escort Radar service department was they told me Amazon is not an authorized reseller, and they have no idea where they are getting the units from. Furthermore, they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit, not even for money.\u000a

We opened it on a Sunday, plugged it in and watched it for a while, then on Monday it would not come on.  They thought it was a lamp, but that didn't fix it so they came and got it to service it.  We bought it for football season and football season is half over and we still have no TV.  They decided to replace it since they couldn't fix it.  That was three weeks ago.  Now they are giving us the runaround blaming shipping/warehouse/etc for the delay in sending the new one.

However, I felt compelled to write a review tonight because of the constant error messages that pop up saying that there are too many ink cartridges of "X" color installed.  It happens now between every print job, forcing me to open the printer, pull out and re-install one to three of the tanks, and then print my document.

aS"\tStrong +'s injured by not-infrequent paper jams\n\tI love the basic design, great hardware/software linkage, and software interface of this Mac-happy scanner.  However, I value my time too much to babysit the feed mechanism of the unit I received last week.  It inconsistently graps multiple pages as other reviewers have disclosed.  So, if you're scanning a 10-page doc and it misses one somewhere along the way, have you really accomplished anything?  No.  You must either try the whole thing again (with likely the same result), or you must figure out what page(s) is missing, scan it separately, and go thru a simple yet not expedient Acrobat process to insert the omitted page.  In the end, this machine made it +90% of the way to being a really great product, but the shortcoming fouls half the machine's overall utility.  Swing a little bit harder next time Fujitsu\n"

I called customer service and after being on hold for 23 minutes I was able to speak with a live representative.  I was told that the machine would need to be replaced.  They sent me a REFURBISHED unit (the warranty indicates that any replacement units will be refurbished units).  They sent the base unit only, so I had to remove the drum unit, paper tray, and handset from the original fax machine to use with the replacement unit.  So, after only a couple of hours of using the replacement unit, I was back on hold to report another machine error.  12 minutes and I finally get a rep.  Apparently, the drum unit (which is less than one month old) is bad.  So now I'm waiting for the replacement drum unit.  DON'T EVER BUY A BROTHER MACHINE.  THEY'RE HORRIBLE MACHINES AND TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY, VERY TIME CONSUMING\n"

When you read the instruction book you will find that you must purchase an adapter from Apple Computer to make it work. Calling Apple, I find that they no longer sell the adapter. When I called Griffin I was surprised to find that if you have any other iPod than Mini and the adapter is not in the box, they will send you one. They recommended that I return the RoadTrip, which is what I did. Save yourself the aggrevation -- if you have an iPod Mini stay away from Griffin Technology\n'

aS"\tAgree...  Speed STINKS!\n\tI had four of theese units in place and they all got replaced by the FVS338.  The main reason is the speed.  I have a lab and we tested the max Internet throughput of the FVS318's at 1.2Mbps!  This is unacceptable.  Oh yes, this is with the latest firmware.\n\nSeveral calls to customer service left me infuriated at the lack of comprehension of the problem.  I contacted their legal deptartment the same day.  Several promises were made on Netgears part wich resulted in them having another level 1 tech call me again to insist I reinstall my OS!\n\nI have successfully sued to get my money back.\n\nWith all of my venting done, I would like to say that I am still a fan of the Prosafe line and will continue to use it.  But Netgear be warned, I will be all over you until you get this product line properly supported\n"

aS'\tBut the big flaw is low throughput\n\tMost reviews don\'t seem to mention a key spec - the throughput of a firewall. I just upgraded my cable connection to the new (up to) 30Mbs plan and bought an FSV318v3 firewall to use with it. Without the firewall in place, I measured about 25Mbs download speed. When I installed the firewall in between the modem and one computer, download speed went down to 6.5Mbs. I also discovered that if the "enable keyword blocking" checkbox is enabled, the throughput went down to 5Mbs, EVEN IF THERE WERE NO KEYWORDS!\n\nThis firewall is useless if you have a high-speed connection\n'

aS"\tLess than impressed\n\tThe noise canceling is just barely discernible in comparison to when it is turned off and the music quality is not comparable to other earbuds in this price range ($60 list, $35 Amazon). The cloth wrapped cords seem like a nice feature for making them a bit more rugged, but I don't like the way the cords are arranged which create this loop that you put your head into (combined with the stronger cord, better not wear them around machinery since getting them caught will likely result in something a bit more painful than just having the earbuds yanked out of your ears)\n"
p616
aS'\tGreat Technology  Terrible Customer Experience\n\tI had the same exact experience with the poor fit of these headphones and the rude customer service.  Their \'surround-sound\' HE-592 phones don\'t fit well either.\n\nOn the phone Philips told me to buy a part at RadioShack to resolve my problem.  They couldn\'t give me an RS part number because "it isn\'t their product" but they recommend that over selling me or sending me  replacement ear pieces.  According to them this problem was all my fault, I should have realized it sooner, saved my receipts  and  packaging an returned them within 30 days.\n\nFrom a technology standpoint the electronics are outstanding for the size and price.  I like the performance of the phones on planes, trains, etc.  They really work well but I am amazed that Phillips would risk losing customers over pennies worth of silicone.  It is a shame Philips can\'t do better with the customer touchpoints like the ear piece design, their phone support and part replacement policies.\n\nTake a look at Shure\'s products.  Shure sells replacement foam and triple flange sleeve ear pieces for their products.  If you are in the same boat with me and like these except for the fit I think the triple flange sleeves may work as a replacement for the stock Phillips ear pieces\n'

aS"\tNoise Canceling decent; music sound bad\n\tIf you're not that picky about sound quality with music, then these may work for you.  I think the frequency response range with these earbuds are pretty minimal.  To me, the music is all mids.  It's missing significant highs and lows for this price range.\n\nI gave these away to a friend who's not that picky at all, but she could tell a difference in sound quality right away.  She normally uses the IPod earbuds which are uncomfortable to her.  However, the noise canceling out weighs the sound quality so she prefers to use these earbuds over her Ipod buds riding a crowded train or bus.\n\nHopefully I can find something affordable that has good frequency response.  Or maybe I need to educate myself.  Is it the frequency response, the impedence, or something else that covers the sound spectrum?  I'm just looking for a good balance of lows, mids, and highs\n"

aS"\tNoise-cancelling newbie...\n\t...So I was satisfied with the noise-cancelling qualities. The cloth cable is very nice and doesn't tangle as much as the usual plastic ones. I liked not having to spend so much time untangling thes in the morning. The headphones I purchased come with 3 sizes of rubber cap earbud covers and I found only one to be suitable for my ears. Of course, after less than a month one of those earbuds fell off and now I can't use these earphones until I find a replacement somewhere, which is proving to be troublesome. Super. I didn't buy these on clearance at Target so that hurts my pocketbooks and I am very ANNOYED right now. In the meantime, I've returned to some $10 non-earbud headphones and I really miss the noise-cancelling quality of these Philips earbuds. Life sucks and I want to die because now I can hear everything going on around me during the morning commute on public transportation.\n"

aS"\tPoor image quality\n\tI agree with the person who says there are no instructions and poor image quality. I wonder if they gave us a mini jack like games systems use if it would work better on TVs that have the 3 jacks on the front. Games systems get good image quality so why is this so bad... No info on this from Monster. Looks like a very good product but I will return it unfortunately. I did discover though that I can use a stereo jack with R-L on one end and a mini jack on the ibook end to give me audio speakers on any TV or Stereo for my iTunes, and audio for a DVD that I am playing but I don't need to spend this much money to get that. If the image were good I would keep it. I would rather show my slide shows from the computer. The image was very bad..\n"

It was quite expensive (I paid $200 to get it) but here are what I have found to be its shortcomings: No caller-id display. This just baffles me. I get caller-Id on all other phones in the house except this one. I have tried every possible varient (resetted settings, disconnected other phones, etc.) but nothing works: I always get "NO ID MESSAGE" on the LCD. The second major shortcoming is that called-parties often complain about the feedback on the speakerphone. One way to reduce that is by lowering the volume significantly, but that sort-of defeats the purpose of having a good speakerphone. Another minor shortcoming is that the phone requires to be powered even though it is a corded-phone (hence will not work in case of emergencies). Finally, two connect two lines you have to use an ugly adapter. One good thing about the phone is that it looks quite good, has a professional appearance, and claims to have a duplex-speakerphone.\n'

aS'\tJUNK, JUNK, JUNK!\n\tI just purchased yesterday the Home Dock Deluxe for list price at a local retailer.  I read all the reviews, (most of them bad but I got it anyway) the menu on TV part being my motivation.  And so far, I am not feeling good about buying it...\n\n1.\tThe sound quality is very poor.  Almost every song has some distortion and sounds "muffled" along with a good hiss.  I thought I was listening to a 70\'s era cassette it was so bad!  I have a high end Sony/Infinity system and the poor sound is very noticeable.  In desperation (and checking to make sure my amp was working fine) I plugged in my Apple dock from my 4th Gen Photo 60gb and the standard Apple AV cable.  The sound problem disappeared, and was crystal clear.\n2.\tThe menus to not work properly.  My Nano 5gb seems to work OK, but my 60gb 4th Gen Photo does not.  The menus are rather slow, and the artist, or album, or song titles disappear at random.  Sometimes you can back up a level on the menu and you will see the data, but mostly it is just blank.  The cursor will scroll down as though there is data there, but nothing shows on the screen.  You can play the music from the blank screen, but it is pot luck as to what you will play as you cannot see any titles.  I like the idea, but VERY, VERY frustrating.\n3.\tThere is NO support at all from the DLO website. It just lets me download a PDF of the manual or to buy more accessories.  I did not even bother contacting them due to all the problems.   I am not impressed.  \n4.\tThere also all the other problems listed elsewhere, too light and build quality poor, annoying power LED on front, no artwork on TV menu etc...\n5.\tSo basically, it is WAY too expensive.  Not worth it.  Not even worth 10% of the price charged.\n\nI should have listened to all the comments above, and not believed some of the "official" reviews on the web.  So it is back in the box and ready for a trip back to the store.  I guess my lesson is that I should trust the reviews\n'

aS'\tGreat form but does not work with my optical mouse\n\tThe mouse pad is a great idea with superb support for the wrist.

Great idea but poorly implemented.\n'

aS"\tThe strap sucks, and the bag is really heavy\n\tWow, I can't believe how much I hate this bag.  And it was expensive, compared to some of the stuff I passed up.  I thought I couldn't go wrong with Targus...but I could and I did.  First, the strap is horrible.  It keeps getting twisted and I have marks on my shoulder from where it cuts in to it.  2nd, it's REALLY heavy.  Lastly, there's all these compartments that don't do anything and mostly get in the way.  Like the phone add-on.  My phone doesn't fit in there, and even if it did, would I carry my phone on my bag?\n"

aS'\tlaptop must draw current before other device charges\n\tNot so happy. Ordered one of these and plugged by PDA which did not charge.\n\nTurns out that it only charges when the larger item is drawing current. So it will only charge the phone/pda etc IF the laptop is drawing current. This is very annoying when the laptop is shut down with a full battery since it draws no current, thus the phone/pda do not charge\n'

aS'\tDo Your Research\n\tI bought this drive with the advice from my father who has bought several LaCie\'s for his company. He\'s always had good luck with them.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed when I opened the box was that there was a gap between the case and the faceplate. I called LaCie customer service and they sent me instructions on how to open the case and also noted my serial number so that I wouldn\'t void my warranty. The problem was that there were 2 screws that hold the faceplate onto the internal chassis who were not even tighted (as if they started the screws and didn\'t tighten them).\n\nBy the way... the actual HD inside the case is a Maxtor. If I had know that prior to purchase, I would not have bought the LaCie.\n\nI fixed the problem with the case and turned it on.. only to be hit with a high pitched winning sound coming from the HD. This noise will drive me crazy and is not "Ultra Quiet" as noted in the description. I\'m sending it back to Amazon for a refund\n'
p633
aS"\tLaCie drive quit working\n\tWhat a disappointment that what I thought was a reputable company makes such an unreliable product.  After about a years time, my LaCie drive started clicking.  And then, no data.  It completely failed.  I too made the mistake of trusting this drive and didn't back it up.  I am sick about what I've lost.  I've emailed LaCie about the failure and have not received a reply.  Beware of LaCie external drives\n"

aS'\tScrewed by ANTonline\n\tANTonline sent me the wrong item and then wanted nothing to do with me when I went to exchange it. They have no phone number, so they email everything. It takes them a day to get back to you and they always have an air about them as if you are bothering them for thier mistake. After days of persistance and me being as rude to them as they were to me, they agreed to take the product back, but I had to eat the first shipping charge, pay to ship it back to them and pay a 20% restocking fee (for thier error!!) The item was only like $10, so by the time I would have paid the shipping and restock fees, I would be in the whole, so I decided to just tell them to go F@#K themselves. I feel better now.\n'

aS"\tNot worth the hassle.\n\tFrom day one, back in late August 2006, I've had problems with this router--which I bought only because my ISP wouldn't install an extra cable outlet in my apartment without written permission from my new landlord. Since I work from home, this wasn't an option at the time. I'm not a tech guy, I don't care much for gadgets, but I'm not stupid either, and I couldn't even get this thing set up without calling support due to lack of documentation and the assumption that everyone buying this router uses some version of Windows--I don't, I have an iMac. Once set up, the router worked fine for about a month, and then I started experiencing connectivity issues. I called support again and they figured out some issue with 'mac cloning' or some such, reset my static IP, and all was well for another week, when the same issue--losing connection with the router after 10-20 minutes online--arose again. So I called support AGAIN, got a guy after 7 minutes, but he directed me to their website to download a firmware update, and then basically hung up on me. Unacceptable. So I called back, sat on hold for 40+ minutes before being disconnected without ever speaking to anyone. Finally, after a third try, I got someone on the line and he got me to the firmware and helped me install it via their web interface, only for me to experience the same connectivity problem the very next day. My ISP is coming Tuesday to install another outlet. No documentation. The install CD is configured for Windows and wouldn't work in Mac OS X. Online help sucks. The 800 support line sucks. This product sucks. Do not buy it\n"

aS'\tWaste of Money\n\tI purchased this router (not from Amazon) about 6 months ago when my 5-year-old, very reliable, router died. I purchased it locally and someone came out and installed it.  I have had numerous problems with this router since then.  It does not stay connected and there is actually no option for "always on."  After having some other problems, I took it back and the vendor upgraded the firmware.  After that, it lost the setup information twice and the info had to be re-entered.  Then today, after being instructed to reset the router, it got stuck in a mode where it only wanted a firmware upgrade (there was no apparent way out of this).  So, I obtained the upgrade and according to the router message, it was updated successfully.  After that, I could not get the router to work at all.  I gave up and ordered an entirely different router (the same brand that I has used before with tremendous success).  My summary - save yourself time and aggravation and don\'t buy the Linksys WRT54G\n'

Voila it works!  Case finished.\n\nNO IT IS NOT.\n\nThe tech support people don't speak English and it shows in their grammar and inability to understand that my problem seems to be a variant on what they have in their knowlege base.\n\nHP would do better to hire native English speakers.

aS"\tDisappointing.\n\tI bought this so I could listen to my iPod in my car in the city.  The first couple of times, it worked great, but after that, something happened.  It just wouldn't work.  All I heard was static, no matter what frequency I tried this on.  I have yet to take a road trip with it, so maybe that will work better, but right now, I am not happy with the product.  Maybe the fact that I live in a city with radio stations on virtually every frequency has something to do with it, but it used to work on some frequencies, and now it just doesn't anymore.  I am very disappointed\n"

aS"\tHas it's problems\n\tThis would be a great phone if it worked all the time.  I had to return the phone within 1 day because the handset was defective.  Amazon was very helpful and prompt with a response.  However the handset would periodically quit working and required that the batteries be removed and reinserted to make it operational.  After 2 months the handset died completely.  AT and T will replace the handset under warranty, but it could take up to 3 weeks to get the replacement\n"

aS"\tNon Compatable\n\tI have several friends that have had similar items in the last few years that have worked nicely. I'm sure this is a great product. Having said that... this product is NOT and I repeat IS NOT compatable with the new ipod nanos. The new Ipod Nanos are slightly wider than the original and will not connect to this product. I really hope amazon puts up a warning soon and I will do my best to try to get that done. Again this does not work with the 4GB and I assume the 8GB nano as well so do not buy it unless you have the older model Nano.\n"

aS"\tlimited reliability, not so much fun\n\tI bought this card more then a year ago. Overall I'm not impressed, and wouldn't buy it again. First of all, in ~30% of cases it crashes my Tungsten E. Secondly, the games are not that much fun. SimCity is EXTREMELY limited and not enjoyable to play at all. Honestly, I have more fun playing games I've downloaded for free. Final annoyance - the card is slimmer then a regular SD so it slides off easily from the slots of the hardcase making it easy to lose\n"

aS'\tDont waste your money\n\tA $10 cable does the same thing.  Do not believe the hype.  Monster is overpriced and people are starting to realize it.  Its digital, 1s and 0s.  Either it reads it or it doesnt.\n'
p657
aS'\tGreat product, terrible cost.\n\tHave you ever heard the saying that something would cost you "an arm and a leg"? These cables cost that, your first son, and bidding rights to your estate. Don\'t get me wrong- Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they\'re just incredibly expensive, and this is made much worse with these cables.\n\nSeveral people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error-correction and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future, there\'s really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes, the gold-plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit, but the improvement will be far less than you\'d see between any other "cheap" versus "designer" cables on the market.\n\nBut Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference, and that\'s worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy, so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn\'t just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn\'t doubt if they\'re certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike, you\'re looking at the right cables.\n\nBut for nearly all consumers, these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives, with no real plusses. At the very least, you can pick up a mid-grade cable (Sony, etc) at a mid-grade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold-plated connections. And over these products, the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time, and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You\'ll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables\n'

aS"\tunimpressed\n\tOk...it functions well as a clock radio.  Just fine.  Reliable.   But that's not too much to expect.  Yes, it will charge your iPod and it does have the nifty function of an alarm that gradually (though not gradual enough) gets louder.  The adaptor for my Nano fit fine; and I didn't find the clock too bright (it has 3 settings).  But the sound is really terrible.  It sounds like its coming from a transistor radio.    \n\nAs well, it advertises that you will be able to go to sleep and wake up with your iPod.  But as we know, you don't need a clock radio to do that--your iPod will do that on its own if you set it.  \n\nI took this back after 5 days and hooked up some cheap computer speakers with a volume control.  They really sound better--I swear.\n"

I had orgaized my collection in the file system nicely by genre, author, album etc, and this thing messed up everything.

I was so excited, that I immediately burn two discs with the best setting, but both come out fuzzy and presented the "out of focus" dull feel, look terrible with no detail compared to the HP bonus disc.

You cannot use one as a backup for this very reason, copying large amounts of data will fail and you have to start over or copy in chunks. \n\nOne drive failed after 8 months, only at the 10 month mark did I realize it was still under warranty. It had a 1 year warranty so 2 months left, I contacted lacie and after asking for a copy of the original invoice which clearly listed the purchase date they began ignoring my email and would not honor their warranty, no RMA after requesting one 5 times, no more email responses since they could not come up with a reason to refuse service.

aS'\tI\'ve finally learned a VERY expensive lesson\n\tDON\'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!\n\nSecond ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn\'t).\n\nOther than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product.

If we were beyond shouting distance the radios did not receive any signal at all.  Even at very close range there was too much static to understand anything.  I'll post a review of the SX700s after we get a chance to try them out\n"

aS'\tLove the features, Hate the range and usage!\n\tFrom cellphone and also the pager era I began my love affair with Motorola.  Don\'t need to read much farther into my review to get to the meat of it.  Sometimes companies make a lousy product even though they have others that are great!  Don\'t Buy These!  They fall into the former category  \n\nI needed them quickly (to give my in-laws time to practice using them before we went on a cruise) so when I went to their house for the weekend I bought them from the hated "Best Buy".  I am returning all 4! (2 sets of 2 handsets).  Here was my experience:\n\nI went in and saw the Midland and the Cobra along side the Motorola.  Not knowing much of Midland, but recognizing Cobra from their history with low-end phones and electronics, I opted with the very stylish Motorola T6500R\'s.  I know.  Big Mistake!  I am a computer programmer and very intelligent, but when confronted with products I do not undestand, I go for the brand name.  Which is something that can be forgiven if, as now, you find out what the problem is and correct it.\n\nI took them home and recharged them.  First things first:  The feel in your hand.  EXCELLENT.  They feel as good as they look.  I purchased these to go on a cruise to the Mexican Riviera and to maintain contact both on the boat and in the ports: Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo san Lucas.  We wanted to make sure we did not "lose" my in-laws (really!  I mean it!  No, really ....) \n\nAnyway. Charged them up and turned them on. They come with a plastic-encased group of 3 AA rechargable batteries that fit nicely (and only one way--they are keyed) in the dual-purpose battery compartment.  This is nice: if you are out and running around and your charge goes down, simply buy 3 AA alkaline batteries and go on your way.  There is no problem if you forget you have the NORMAL NON-RECHARGABLE AA batteries in the case if you put it in the charging stand.  Unlike other units, the physical metal conductors to charge the battery pack are actually built into the pack, not the handset.  If you put it batteries, the charger makes no connection to the handset. If you put in the rechargable battery pack, 2 silver contacts from the battery pack  contact the charging stand and VOILA the unit charges.  Fitting the handset into the recharger is a nightmare, though!  It must be generic and able to fit several different Motorola products (production outsourced to Giant Int\'l Ltd--so if you thought this was a genuine Motorola built item, you are mistaken.  The entire Talkabout line are outsourced for production) as the dual-compartment charger has 2 inserts in each compartment and no indication of which one to use for the T6500R\'s.  I am a smart person though so I chose the one that looked like it best fit and inserted it.  Then I attempted to insert the T6500R\'s.  I say attempted because the bottom of the handset is rounded and thus does not seat well in any direction.  After you get it to EXACTLY the right position (look on the charger to watch for the LED to light up) the the hard part (of charging, that is) is over.\n\nNext item: Bad red LCD backed screen.  Hard to read in ANY light and impossible in the sunlight.  Settings were easy enough.  Channel, sub-channel, vibrate, NOAA broadcasts, etc.  However, the advertised QT (ensures no one can talk through your handset unless they are using a compatible Motorola handset) does not work unless you hit the PTT (push to talk) button (or the CALL button), wait about 3 seconds and begin speaking.  My in-laws are new to technology and are used to experiencing walkie-talkies when their kids were young.  Therefore this is unusual.  They automatically want to push the button and talk.  So, the first part of what they say is immediately lost. \n\nI say "first part".  I am assuming I actually caught a portion of what they said.  This brings me to the second major flaw.  This unit contains a HORRIBLE speaker.  If the volume is too low then you can\'t hear it.  Too high and it is garbled beyond your ability to understand it.  We were really hard-pressed to find a happy medium.  AND, in a noisy room, it would\'ve been impossible to hear anything.\n\nSome merchants list these as 5 mile radios.  The packaging says 10.  The 1 watt GMRS suggests about 5-10.  We got less than 1.  Directly over a lake. In vehicles on the I-5, we drove less than 2 miles from their house  (which is DIRECTLY ON the interstate) and got no signal.  \n\nI got back to my house in San Jose (on top of Communications Hill...the largest "hill" in the area) and could not communicate to my spouse less than 1/2 mile away while he was coming up our road!\n\nSince the weekend, I have spent all my extra time on Amazon.com and Consumer Reports reviewing all the offerings.  (the latter, Consumer Reports\' reviews are from July in 2002!) So, I think I am going to return these and purchase the Midland 5 watt GXT500\'s from Amazon.  Remember, doubling the wattage (in this case MORE than doubling) does not give double the signal.  As another others have stated, increasing wattage increases only another portion of the distance--ie: 2 watts to 4 watts does NOT double the distance the signal can reach.)\n\nHope this reveiw helps you\n'

aS'\tThese disks really do STINK!!!!!\n\tI bought 1 40 pack of these disks so that I could create a set of Windows 95 setup disks. They worked to install windows once and then they all started dying.

aS"\tLike a Porsche... without wheels!\n\tWhen realtime traffic monitoring came to my city, I immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife's daily business driving (2-500 miles weekly, crisscrossing a 50-mile area through major traffic routes). I quickly settled on an automotive GPS with realtime traffic monitoring. There are not yet many choices in this area, so the options boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720. (These use FM radio for the traffic info; the XM-radio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since I don't want XM radio.)\n\nI chose the Cobra for its large screen and positive reviews in areas that were important to me. Its flawed routing ability was not a major issue as it was to be used in a well-known region. Address lookup and traffic monitoring were the primary needs.\n\nIn short, I don't know much about how the Cobra performs because I was only able to use it for a few short test trips. This is because the mounting hardware is one of the most deficient pieces of engineering I have ever encountered in higher-end electronics gear:\n\n- The only mounting option is via suction cup, which in tests would adhere reliably only to nearly flat glass. A stick-on disc for attaching the suction cup is also provided, but I did not attempt to use it and would not trust it to be able to hold this heavy (1.25 pound) unit over the long run. If your vehicle does not have a flat section of windshield in a convenient location, you will have very few options for mounting this unit.\n\n- California law prohibits attaching things to the windshield, meaning that California users either need to risk a minor ticket or find an acceptable alternate mounting point. (Good luck to you: I was unable to find one in three different vehicles!) Compounding the problem is that the mount has a very limited positioning range and easily runs out of adjustment room for most potential mounting alternatives.\n\n- Cobra does not offer any other mounts or mounting accessories at all - no beanbag or friction mount, no clamp, no fixed-base mount, nothing. If there is any aftermarket option (RAM Mount, etc.) I was unable to find it. You are stuck with Cobra's proprietary mount unless you are willing to modify the unit or its mounting pieces and fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base.\n\nI was *almost* willing to go the extra mile to make this unit work in my vehicle, even though the best solution would have been very awkward to dismount and remount, making it a potential theft target.\n\nThe final straw was when I found that the traffic receiver was faulty and I was unable to get a reply from the manufacturer in a timely manner (two days now and counting...) Enough's enough; something was telling me that this unit wasn't the right choice.\n\nSo this unit is being returned and I've already ordered a Garmin 2720 with GTM11 traffic receiver in replacement. The prices for the units through Amazon are nearly the same (especially when factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring - the Cobra comes with three months and gets $60 per year after that, while the Garmin comes with 15 months and has the same annual cost after that - so you have to add $60 to the Cobra to get a truly equivalent price). Garmin also has excellent mounts with a range of attachment options, some of the best map and routing tools, and a long track record with GPS units. It does have a smaller screen and some complaints about the user interface, but at least I can mount it properly and be able to tuck it away and remount it easily to prevent theft.\n\nThis unit gets two stars only because my brief experience with its function appears to live up to all the positive reviews - but overall, it's like a high-performance sports car with no wheels! I 100% recommend against it for California users and suggest that others try to lay hands on a sample unit to see if it can be properly mounted in your vehicle before laying out $750\n"

aV	Beware!\u000a	I ordered the Passport X50 from Amazon to save the $18 shipping Escort Radar was charging. I was told by someone at Escort Radar that Amazon was an authorized reseller.\u000a\u000aAfter having my detector on for ten minutes (right out of the box), it did three "SELF CAL"s, then said "SERVICE REQUIRED". I called Escort Radar and was told "If you let the car power up the unit when you start the car, the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused. You must first start the car, and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector." It makes some sense, but if this is really the case, why don't they put those instructions in their manual? After trying this many times, the unit was "still confused", so I returned it for a replacement.\u000a\u000aMy second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened. This time Escort Radar told me "if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night, this has been found to cause problems." Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition, so this doesn't apply. Escort Radar also told me that "excessive heat" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100\ufffd heat, and I'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun, but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car. It gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country. There are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90\ufffd or leaving it off in a hot car. You wouldn't design a ski that doesn't work below 35\ufffd, would you???\u000a\u000aThe most troubling part of my conversation with Escort Radar service department was they told me Amazon is not an authorized reseller, and they have no idea where they are getting the units from. Furthermore, they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit, not even for money.\u000a

aS"\tHope you went to college\n\tI've got an engineering degree in computer science.  I've been supporting multi-million dollar web applications for years.  It took me 4 hours to get this device to sync properly with the Rhapsody music subscription service that it is promoted for.  There is no way a normal person is going to be able to get it to function in any capacity except as a straight mp3 player.\n\nIt's not ipod caliber quality, the only reason you'd get it is for the Rhapsody service.  If you are not highly technical and patient, move on!\n\nPlayer itself works fine\n"

aS'\tNice, but No Control\n\tI had high expectations for this product, having bought some of Sandisk\'s other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn\'t give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example, using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode, one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works, but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped. \n\nIt would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them, with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes; instead, Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. "It\'s our way or the highway." Once one masters creating playlists, they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.\n\nIt\'s too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews, one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other, previous Sandisk products). Well, you can, but it won\'t make much difference if the device won\'t play.\n'

aS"\tONE STAR TOO MANY! HORRIBLE!!!!\n\tThis is about the worse thing i've ever bought for an ipod accessory. It does NOT work. All I heard was static, and very little music. If you do want to hear music, you literally have to hold your ipod right next to the radio and stay perfectly still or all you'll get is static. I bought this online and received it and was so excited to use it. I was hesitant to buy it, seeing almost every review has said it doesn't work but I bought it anyway, don't buy it! Every review I've seen has negative feedback for this item, and I agree with everyone. I figured since Griffin made a new itrip, it would be better and work great. However, it is the total opposite from that. I do NOT recommend this product at all. Don't waste your time or money\n"

I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution....\n"
p730
aS"\tNot worth the headache\n\tI've had this MP3 player since it came out and, if anyone is still considering getting it, I must advise otherwise.  The MP3 player itself looks and feels great, and the navigational features are very easy to use.  The problem is that the player itself is extremely unreliable.  I have used 3 versions of this player (expecting each time that the player was simply faulty), and all of them glitch up terribly.  I constantly have to take my battery out to reset the player as it will freeze during normal play.  It also freezes half of the time that I try to sync with WMP.  In addition, sometimes it simply refuses to take deleted songs off of my H10's list of tracks (even though they no longer exist on the player).\n\nFinally, iRiver has terrible customer service and they do not even back their own products!  As a owner of two iRivers (H10 and the 120), I have seen for a while how they function: they will offer updates for their faulty firmware for about a month, and then they leave that product to produce a new one.  It seems like they have a new Mp3 player being introduced every few months.  Their customer service is extremely hard to get a hold of, and if you do, they will simply say you need to send it to the factory (occasionally you will get a rep that will actually send you a brand new one for free, though).\n\nBe smart, stick to a Creative, the new Toshiba Gigabeat S, or (clench your fists) an iPod\n"

aS"\tYou get what you pay for\n\tI ordered this mount for a Sharp 20 inch LCD and it's not that great. It was very easy to install, however, the arm when fully outstretched does not sit level. Thus when the TV is pulled away from the wall, the set is not level and very annoying to look at. I don't believe this is a fault in the actual part, but the design of the arm. This was relatively inexpensive for a wall mount - and you get what you pay for\n"

aS"\tPoorly made, instructions unclear, may have damaged my laptop\n\tI'd recommend selecting a different security cable product, especially if you have a PowerBook or MacBook. This one is poorly made, even more poorly documented, and may have permanently damaged my PowerBook G4. (Yes, the product web site claims this model is compatible with the PB  G4.) \n\nIt's unclear from the cryptic instruction diagram on the back of the packaging which direction is locked and which is unlocked. (Hey, would it be so bad to actually use *words* to explain things? Even in 4 or 5 languages if you like. The diagrams make no sense.)\n\nIn the process of trying to get this to work, it appears that the locking teeth chewed up the security slot of my PowerBook. It may have permanently damaged the slot. Needless to say, I will attempt to return the product for a refund. \n\nThere are plenty of similar products on the market, including others avaiable through Amazon. I'd suggest trying one of those.\n"

aS"\tThis is a bad product, waste your money on something else.\n\tTotal garbage. No only this thing is huge, bigger than most mp3 players and it doesn't have a belt clip or anything, it sounds awful, absolutely horrible. The hiss others complained about is very loud, it also picks up all sorts of interference resulting in beeping, buzzing and all kinds of high pitched noises. Besides the hiss and the interference the sound is horrible, low dynamics and distorts easily. This is a bad product that should be taken off the market. It's not even worth the price here. Heck, even $1.99 would be a waste of money. Avoid\n"

The high price iMuffs MB210 from WI-GEAR gives a better promise with the ability to stop your iPod music and take a cellphone call with noise canceling microphone.  Its Bluetooth adapter fits cleaning on iPods with dock connectors, likely will not break as easily.  I sure hope Logiteh will follow suit in this trend\n"

aS"\tGood TV but ..\n\tI have had this TV for less than 90 days and bulb has burned out, I called Samsung support and the bulb is covered by warranty.  They said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours.  72 hours later still no call, I again called Samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and I would be called in 24 hours, still no call.  This was repeated 5 times and each time I asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area.\n\nFianlly after 6 calls, Samsung referred me to another center.  I then called them and they sent up an appointment 3 days later.  Day of appointment technician called and told me from the problem I described when I made the appointment I needed a new bulb (duh) and he had ordered one this morning and would call to make another appointment once they received the bulb. I specifically asked if they had the bulb in stock when I made the appointment.  Why they didn't order the bulb when they first set up the appointment, I don't know.  I called Samsung again and was told bulbs are usually shipped within a week of the order.  Neither the words usually or week improved my impression of their support. My fear is that when the technician comes out to change the bulb he will find another part he has to order and I am back on the Samsung support merry-go-round again. \n\nNow I realize that even though the set does (did) have a good picture etc, if you can't see it, it doesn't matter. I now have a very expensive paperweight. For me Samsung support has been a black hole and I have yet to see any results after two weeks and no hope in sight for the near future.  What happens after the warranty is over and I have to pay for a new bulb every three months?  If this sounds like I am not very happy with the situation that is the truth.  I am tired of Samsung and the service centers being sorry for the problems and delays but then telling me there is nothing they can do at this point.  I agree, you solve the problem by doing the right thing the first time or the second time or third time etc I am hoping maybe the eighth time is the charm with my Samsung experience.\n"

aS'\tNever got past installation setup-customer service bad\n\tI am somewhat computer savvy - I understand the the IP address assigned in installation needs to match what my own router assigned for an ip address.  They don\'t match and I can\'t figure out how to change it.  I called Netgear 4 days ago for help and they said their "senior tech" would have to call me back.  Still waiting for that call.  Back to Staples it goes.  The installation appeared successful, but whenever I try to print, it says "error - printer is busy"  The so-called instruction manual for this is laughable.

I called Sharper Image and they agreed to send a replacement. I waited two weeks and nothing. I called again and they had no record of my previous phone call. They did send a replacement and told me it would be sent overnight if "deemed appropriate by management." It was not shipped overnight.\n\nBottom line - this product is awful. Do not buy - I regret it! It is worth it to spend more money on a different product. This only has a 90 day warranty and it doesn\'t last quite that long.\n'

I turned the machine off and when I switched it back on the carriage went to the far left and will not move, ie I cannot type or use the machine in any way. When the machine came two of the keys were knocked loose and I had to stick them back on. Now when I look at the machine I can see it is assymetrical...there is a 1/4 gap in the base, so it must have been dropped or damaged somewhere.  This is not acceptable but I have no way to contact whoever Mstasad is.  I have a huge project to do over the labor day weekend but I don\'t have a typewriter that works.

At first I thought the battery was dead, but a new battery didn't help.  The screen would flash on and then off.  It will not boot up.  Plugging it into the computer did no good, it could not be reconized or accessed.  It goes in the trash.  In addition when it was working the shuffle mode would only play some of the songs stored.  Also, the output volumn was to low.  I would use it while riding my bike and it needs to be loud enough to hear it over the road noise, it wasn't up to the task.  Now it is landfill\n"

Now the battery contacts are not functioning properly. \nAnd I had the same problem described in a recent review: "I\'ll click three or four times and nothing happens.

aS'\tdisappointing\n\tI bought this phone for a work-at-home situation.  I then discovered that the maximum number of characters I could enter into  a speed dial entry (the number itself, not the name) is 24 characters.  A telephone calling card number is 25 characters long, 26 if you program a pause (a space, for this phone) between the phone number and the card id/pin.  When I called Polycom about it, I was told that not everyone uses calling cards.  Funny.  I\'ve been issued a calling card at every company for which I\'ve worked (going back 25 years).  This is the only phone I\'ve ever owned (well, since the 80\'s) into which I could not program my calling cards.  Pretty basic stuff for product marketing and development people to miss.\n\nOn top of that, when I try and enter the calling card number and card id by hand, it never "takes" on the first try: the network doesn\'t recognize the card id and pin the first time I enter them.  I have to do it twice (I\'ve tried this a number of times, and it\'s consistent).\n\nFor that matter, the sound quality, especially through the headset (also purchased from polycom) is not that good.  Of course, that could be because the headset jack is "loose."  You can easily move the jack from side to side, which makes the sound quality even worse. \n\nI regret having made this purchase.  I\'m going to scrap it and look for a new one from a different manufacturer.  The only reason I gave it one star is because the site interface here won\'t let me give it no stars\n'

aS'\tNice feel, but terrible tracking--huge lag time\n\tI\'ve had this mouse for about a month...use it with my Mac G4 at home...and I\'m exhausted. It feels very nice in the hand and I really like the scrolling ball feature (hence the 2 stars), but it\'s just not predictable. Sometimes it glides along smoothly, most other times it tracks across the monitor like you\'re mousing over pebbles. I\'ve tried a number of different surfaces: desktop (light woodgrain); smooth, medium gray fabric mouse pad; mouse pad made specifically for optical mice (better than the other two) and I have even tried picking the thing up and shaking it to knock it into submission--to no avail. It still lags and I have a hard time honing in on an object to select it (or to check a box or pick up a puzzle piece in a jigsaw puzzle...)\n\nI use Photoshop and other mousing intensive apps all day at work and at home and I need a mouse that is precise (for silhouetting, etc.). This just isn\'t it. You shouldn\'t have to think about mousing when you\'re doing it, it should just happen--immediately and smoothly, corded or cordless. And a "newer" technology should work better that a gummed up "old" tracking ball mouse!\n\nMaybe it doesn\'t like my older Mac. Maybe it\'s the bluetooth adapter. Whatever it is, it\'s not working...\n\nI\'ll be trying the Logitech MX1000 next. It has a recharging base and is Laser (instead of optical). I\'m hoping the higher price will translate into better performance\n'

aS"\tThe mouse with Parkinson's disease\n\tFor my PowerBook - my first bluetooth mouse (a macally bt) worked for about nine months and then a bad battery caused major leakage all over my desk. So for the replacement I read the reviews and went with the Kensington bluetooth mini - primarily for the on/off functionality.\n\nI like the size and shape, the on/off switch and the scroll works just keen. However, tracking is a nightmare - especially when CPU usage is high (applications like Photoshop, Acrobat or using a VPN to access my work files). I tried troubleshooting, adjusting the track rate, but nope. The cursor continues to stutter across the screen with this mouse.\n\nI think I'm going to throw in the towel and go back to wired\n"

I've not been able to re-format the card in either a canon eos 5d, digital rebel, or using software on my computer.

One quark was the IP address field for the radius server wouldn\'t accept more than one character in the forms. Up and running. However, upon reboot, the WG302 loses it Radius info and then cannot authenticate a client again. SHOWSTOPPER. After logging this with Netgear support - their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support. While this would be fine if it was a config issue, it\'s not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase. They give no further support now.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend against the extra cost of this unit given it\'s buggy and has poor support. Config is difficult (I had to learn how to use the command line config), the upgrades are not well documented (they imply you have to import some obscure file with tftp - you don\'t but...), however the unit does have good range and works (No RADIUS of course) in a basic config.\n'

aS"\tDisappointing\n\tFirst - a disclaimer: I know very little about telephone headsets, but decided to buy one because I had a series of long telephone meetings coming up.\n\nI walked to my local Staples store, expecting to find a variety of prices and products - and thinking that I'd pay perhaps $30 to $50 at the low end of the market.\n\nAt the store, I found that only the computer-based headsets were that cheap - and the only model that worked on a real, old-fashioned land line was the Plantronics S11 on display (it was priced at $130 Canadian).\n\nSince work was paying for it, I didn't mind spending the extra money, but expected that, at that price, the quality and ease of use would be quite high.\n\nWhen I brough it back to the office and installed it, I found that:\n\n- The regular handset and the headset cannot be plugged in at the same time. That means that every time I want to use the headset, I need to fumble around at the back of the unit to switch wires.\n\n- The volume of both ingoing and outgoing conversation is very low - even when I turn up the volume controls to max. The people I spoke with complained enough that I switched back to my regular handset.\n\n- The microphone, although it's somewhat adjustable, is short and inflexible enough that I can't get it very close enough to my mouth. When I try to move it closer, the earpiece turns and slips off my ear.\n\n- The headset itself - that is, the plastic, adjustable arch and rubber pad opposite the speaker - is very awkward and prone to slipping off my head. It might have been better to design it like a regular two-sided earphone unit - so that it would be more balanced and stay secure.\n\nI don't know whether these comments apply only to the S11 or to most headsets for traditional phones in general.\n\nOverall, however, if I'd been buying the S11 with my own money, I would likely have returned it and just gone back to using the regular phone handset\n"

After formatting my computer I was able to install the scanner and software without any problems.  I am still learning to use it but so far I have decided not to return it.  It works well and I like it very much.  I apologize if my review has negatively effected anyone's choice\n"

aS"\tPoor Quality!\n\tMy daughter really didn't use it that much but within about 5 weeks it started to fall apart.  The wood veneer on the base pulled up and splintered from tightening the strings to tune it.  A low price for a guitar but I don't think it's even worth this price.\n"

aS"\tfatal design flaw\n\tI bought this because it seemed like it would satisfy my need for a 2-line phone with answering capability. Turns out, I cannot keep it, due to one boneheaded design flaw that makes it unusable for me.\n\nThe good: it's nice looking, compact, has good sound, and has a selection of cute little ringtones.\n\nThe bad: This machine WILL NOT RECORD INCOMING MESSAGES SILENTLY. It broadcasts both the OGM and the ICM being left by the caller through the speaker. There is no way I know of to defeat this. You can turn the volume down from loud to medium loud, but you cannot set the machine to record messages silently, in the background. \n\nDo you think you might ever not want other people in the room to hear the messages being left on your recorder? Would you ever want to sleep without being disturbed by the sound of incoming messages?\n\nThen this one isn't for you.\n\nMine is for sale.\n"

aS"\tMotorola lost a loyal customer\n\tMy very first cell phone was Motorola, and it served me great, so I became attached to the brand based on that experience ,and for that reason alone bought  Motorola SD4591 Digital Corded/Cordless System.  As we've put the wireless network in house the cordless phone started playing tricks. The battery life got very short very soon too. I was told I need to get different batteries NiH instead of NiCD. Naturally the microwave was playing the tricks on cordless too. As we have two lines in house and was told by several people to move to 5.8Hz 2 line phone I decided to get Motorola MD7091 5.8GHz Digital 2-line Phone and remained loyal to Motorola. And boy was I wrong again. What others are saying about caller ID not showing as soon as I have another phone on the same line besides Motorola MD 7091 is true in my case too. I don't get it does Motorola expect us to switch phones to their system now around the house if we want to used one of their phones??? This is really cheap trick\n\nNaturally, I could blame all this on poor quality of NiCD batteries, Wireless Network, Microwaves and phone company, and other brands' phones connected to my line. But what is the common thread through the entire ordeal: MOTOROLA. I will give other brands a try now, not yet sure which ones\n"

aS"\tdon't get the cordless sets!!\n\tNow, imagine my astonishment. After receiving this beautifully designed futuristic looking set from my favorite communication device manufacturers, I set it up only to realize that the cordless phone only works when there is a direct line of site to the base!\nUnbelievable!! I live in a compact apartment ok, and believe me when I say it isn't 20 feet between the base and my bed room, and last night after setting up, I retreated to my room took up the cordless handset to make a call only to realize that there was no connection to the base.\nThis phone in a nutshell, looks good, but it sucks!!\n"
p775
aS"\tGood looking, clumsy to use\n\tI had high hopes for this case when I bought it, but it just hasn't worked out.  The leather has a nice feel, and my iPAQ fit snugly in it's slot.  However the stylus on my iPAQ h2215 was impossible to get to without partially removing the iPAQ from it's case.  This became so frustrating that I eventually discontinued using this case.\n\nIt does have three slots for credit cards, and a larger slot that you could tuck a few folded dollar bills or business cards in.\n\nMaybe a different model of iPAQ would work better, but it hasn't been a good fit for me\n"

aS"\tUseless - does not retract\n\tI agree with the previous review.  This phone cord worked twice.  Now, it only retracts about half way, and keeps getting worse.  I'm returning it for a refund.  Don't waste your time with this\n"
p777
aS"\tDO NOT Wast your time with this product...period\n\tI am on my second one and I will be returning this one also. Both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that. I was so mad I almost threw it against the wall. I thought the first one was a defect, but then when I got the second one I realized it was a design flaw... If you buy the Targus one keep your receipt because I guarantee you will be returning it. What I don't get is how Targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it: Satisfaction Guaranteed. What a joke..\n"

aS'\tstupidity at its best\n\tipods are the leading sellers of portable players and everybody knows that but guess what ipod does not support the leading and best quality video format divx and avi hmm thats kinda retarded no? if any of you out there use file sharing programs such as limewire or any torrent programs if u download any of those videos the best ones and the majority are divx and avi too bad for you unless ur willing to sit around for an hour or two and convert your video to mpeg4. Also the video you convert may have a few complications, the audio and video may not be sychronized...at all and for those of you who have already purchased this piece of garbage im sorry and i have great sympathy for you so if ud like a program that will convert ur video for free and results in pretty good quality go to download.com and search for jodix video converter. This is not from speculations I have experienced this all myself with my own purchase of the video ipod and was a decision i regreted.

The Ipod is a 4th Generation 40 gig that is fully updated.  I think Belkin needs to engineer the recorders to work with all the new IPods, with the exception of the minis.  Have not been able to resolve the issue. I am sure IPod will state that it is a Belkin problem and that Belkin will throw the ball back to IPod????\n'

aS"\tSevere Connection Issues\n\tThis hardware is well-made and I have heard very good things about the non-bluetooth version of the mouse. When it's connected and working, it does its job very well. Unfortuntately the MX5000 set suffers from some very poorly made software that makes it very difficult to use effectively. At seemingly random intervals, the mouse will start lagging or stop altogether. If this happens during gameplay, you're in a bad way. The keyboard also suffers from a truly annoying bug. When it comes off of its sleep state, it will double the first key you press. I have also had the keyboard just reset out of the blue. Add in that the SetPoint software for the LCD screen only fully works with two pieces of software (MusicMatch and Windows Messenger), and you have a very disappointing desktop package. The MX1000 is a great mouse on its own, but stay away from this Bluetooth combo. It is unstable and very frustrating to use\n"

aS'\tVonage is a sinking ship\n\tI had Vonage since April, 2006.  I finally switched back to Qwest after unending problems and hours and hours on the phone (my cell phone, as my Vonage line didn\'t work) with tech support.  Here is my experience:\n\n1) It took about 2 months and about 2 hours on the phone for them to switch my existing phone # over to Vonage.  Don\'t be too excited about getting the first month free- if your moving an existing number it will take about that long to get it switched over.\n\n2) After my number was finally switched over, outgoing calls were constantly being dropped after about 20-30 seconds.  Incoming calls would also be dropped occasionally after about a minute.  This resulted in having to call the person back, saying "sorry the call was dropped- we switched to this cheaper phone service and have been having problems...."\nThis is with the highest speed cable internet service available (8mbps download, 600kbps upload) and a wireless \'g\' system which has provided top notch internet service consistently while I had Vonage problems.  I spent no less than 4 - 5 calls and over 5 hours on the phone with tech support trying to fix the problem.  After talking with tech support, sometimes the problem would be fixed temporarily- while I was on the phone with them- but return shortly thereafter.\n\n3) As a result of the problems I had, I asked to be credited for the months in which my phone service was not working.  Be warned, they are very hard-nosed about providing any credits for poor or no service.  I spoke to a tech support person about getting a credit for a month of no service, and he told me to wait until the problem had been fixed so they could determine how much credit should be given.  After the problem had been fixed (temporarily), I called back and they told me they could only provide credit for the current month, not previous months of no or poor service.  THEY ARE NOT CUSTOMER FRIENDLY ABOUT PROVIDING REFUNDS FOR POOR OR NO SERVICE.\n\n4) Finally, in September, still with dropped calls from Vonage, I switched back to Qwest to get reliable phone service.  I found customer service there has improved and is much better than Vonage.  And they gave me 3 months free promotion for coming back.  \n\nIn the end, I am happy to pay the extra $10/month (after the first 3 months free) to get phone service that works.  I notice that $5 of the extra cost is for fees, etc. that the phone company has to charge but Vonage does not, which is unfortunate.  In any case, I guess you get what you pay for.\n\nOne last thing: Vonage has never made a profit and many business analysts say with their current business plan, they never will.  This means eventually they will either go out of business, or have to raise rates.\n\nSave yourself the problems I had- pay the extra $ to get phone service that works\n'
p787
aS"\tStay away from Vonage!\n\tStay away from Vonage!  After more than 1 month, still don't have phone number transferred.  Can't get thru to customer service...very long wait.  Paying 2 phone bills...so much for saving cost and so-called service.  Called to cancel service, and customer service rep promised to put account/billing on hold until phone number transfer is done...finally something positive from customer service department\n"

EXCEPT FOR THE MIDDLE "wheel" button.\n\tI was really happy with the mouse for all of 10 minutes.\nThe scroll wheel is really "push happy" such that when I roll the wheel, the middle button registers a "click" very often. In order to prevent the inadvertant click, I have to roll the wheel with the lightest of light touches. It\'s significantly more senstive than my older logitech wheel, and was really really annoying to have the browser repeatedly register the middle button (which is unix is the default "paste" so I\'d have pages and pages of text that I "selected" be pasted on to the browser or editor while what I really wanted was just to scroll the buffer!!!\n\nToo bad, the mouse was really high quality overall.\n'

I may have had too high of expectations, but these things put out NO bass whatsoever (it just sounds muffled and cruddy), and the overall sound is extremely poor.  I'm really surprised as I've owned JBL speakers in my car that I was extremely pleased with, so I'm amazed at the lacking quality in these.  I would recommend either finding another similarly priced set with good reviews or paying a little extra and getting something with a sub included\n"

aS"\tWhere's the headphone jack, Jack?\n\tThese speakers sound great - but sometimes you want to crank it up and in the office that's a no-no. So you reach for your phones and... no place to plug them in! How lame is that? Also whoever designed the Volume/On/Off knob is an idiot. The thing is so streamlined and slippery that when you try to turn it, the whole speaker just slips away from you. They're so light that they don't have enough resistance to stay put. So you have to hold it in place with one hand while you turn the knob with the other (unless you velcro them to your desk or something). Too bad because - like I said - they sound great\n"

Equally important, I know that my electronics are receiving clean power.\n\nI feel that this investment is minor compared to the loss of valuable data or the failure of equipment due to a power spike or an irregular power supply.\n\nAs always, Amazon had it to me in  and lt;2 business days\n'

Although not listed in the specs, it must have a QAM tuner, because I am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all I have is basic cable.  I was thrilled when I made this discovery.  Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness.\n\nThe picture quality for analog channels is only so-so.  I really wish the remote was illuminated.  Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised.  Other than these negatives, I'm very happy\n"

aS'\tVery happy football fan !!!\n\tMy new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.\n\nMy cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.\n\nThe quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.\n\nSet-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.\n\nAll in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner\n'

aS"\tFlawless\n\tI have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it's biggest star. You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an  and quot;ABC and quot; book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use\n"

aS'\tProduct desciption could be more specific\n\tI,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice\n'

aS'\tGreat Budget TV\n\tI bought this TV for college, and it fits perfectly in my dorm. The picture quality is pretty decent, though compared to traditional TV, it is not as sharp.\n\nThe audio quality is very good. I was able to play Final Fantasy 12 with this TV, and the audio lives well for my expectations.\n\nNo lag while playing my Playstation 2 console...\n\nThe only downside is that if you want to switch from AV mode back to TV mode, you need to press "SOURCE" on the remote or the TV 4 times...and it\'s annoying waiting for it...but besides that, it\'s a very nice budget TV for anyone that wants a TV that can save you some money and space\n'

aS"\tA great buy\n\tThe intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I've heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it\n"

aS"\tAlmost a must, if you use the battery grip\n\tI wouldn't be without this. When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap. In the end I settled for using both and wouldn't have it any other way. With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold. That's all there is to it, that's what it does and it does it well. \n\nOn the down side, and it's a small and transient down side, actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you'd sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick, security wise, is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first, then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don't like the attachment to the neck strap, I don't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.\n\nI use this on a 20d which typically has a 24-200 or 80-400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip, or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don't have an issue. \n\nIf Canon read this, you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price, you normally pay close attention to detail and it's a bit lacking here\n"

aS'\tBaby this baby.\n\tThis is an excellent machine.  I bought two of them.  There are a few things you need to do.  I have had 100% satisfaction using FujiFilm DVD-R up to 8x.  I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x.  I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x.  Some other brands may not work.  One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.\n\nOne of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVD-RAM.  They are re-recordable for many, many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVD-RAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVD-RAM.  I have over 50 DVD-RAM discs (Panasonic brand) - they sure take up less space than VCR tapes!\n\nGet one or two of these recorders and a Panasonic DVD player and you`ve got it made!  Throw away your VCRs forever!  Just remember to baby them\n'

aS"\tGreat price, easy to use!!\n\tI bought this for my folks for Christmas.  It took no time at all to hook up, and making DVDs was simple.  Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I'm sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can't go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn't seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly.  Because of that, I'm still going to give it a full 5 stars..it's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life.  Really, if you're new to this technology, you're not going to have any problems..believe me..A++\n"

aS'\tIncredible picture! with one flaw on old DVDs\n\tThe other effusive reviews are spot-on...  the picture is fabulous on new DVDs (Lord of the Rings, Nemo, Harry Potter).  A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job.  We have the  Sony KDF-42E2000 42" 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV and are thrilled with the combination.  A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that\'s not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.  And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat.  I\'m sure there\'s a solution, but just can\'t figure it out.  Any tips\n'

aS'\tVHS TO DVD AND IPOD\n\tVHS to DVD disc is just one easy setup. I set mine to record and recode just before I go to sleep. When I wake up a finished disc awaits. With the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct VHS that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape. I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well. IPOD old music videos and movies for a real treat. Sound is perfect\n'

aS'\tA great price for a great battery\n\tMy daughter uses a Cochlear Implant that has the option of being powered by 3 AA batteries. We have tried several brands trying to find the ones that last the longest. We have tried Energizer, Duracell, etc. She needs to replace them every day and a half. Since the Implant is a high power draining device, every extra hour counts. These batteries are one of the best values out there.\n'

aS"\tBe sure to pick the right software package\n\tThe first peron to review this incorrectly stated that it doesn't come with software for handhleds.

Delorme did the right thing and offered us options.  I just ordered mine and I have no plans on using with a HH so I'm very happy that I didn't have to buy the HH software.  Just don't be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it.  Nemerous people have highly recommended this to me, although I have heard that MS Mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option.  Storing 50,000 data points without a connection to a computer is awesome.  I will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route, elevation, etc.  Too bad it is only in Yellow..\n"

aS'\tTotally Secure\n\tI got this jacket a month into having my ipod.  I had to buy it because I had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when I pulled the iPod out of that case it was easy to drop.  One time I did drop it and within a month of owning the iPod I had it in fro repairs.\n\nThis case protected my iPod of another 11 months just fine.  My complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out.  It is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction.  Acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface.\n\nIt will protect your pod though\n'

aS'\tGreat product; lacking directions\n\tThe product works perfectly.  The only problem is, the manual only includes directions for the most common setups.  To use one port as an "uplink" to a router, for example, you need to plug the uplink into the ethernet port labeled "1" and then leave port "2" open.  The directions do not state this, and I had to call Linksys to get it to work.\n\nOther than that, it is fast, reliable, and small.  Perfect\n'

aS"\tWorks better than I anticipated!\n\tMy setup:\n- Dell Latitude PP01L (Intel chip)\n- Win XP Pro\n- D-Link DI-624 Wireless Router (with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna)\n- Enabled the WEP feature\n\nI unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in.  Windows found the new card and did its Plug-n-Play thing.  Not only was I was able to get on the Internet immediately, but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that I couldn't 'see' with my 11MB/sec Cisco Aironet card.  This I sort of expected, but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers.\n\nThe CD installed just fine, but when I went to the D-Link site to check for an updated driver it said I was up-to-date.  I ran Windows Update and it claimed I had an updated driver available for my new D-Link card. I've never had a problem with D-Link's website (or customer service, while we're on the subject), so I was a bit taken aback that Microsoft was ahead of D-Link's site.  \n\nEither way...  install the card and get onto the internet, then have Windows Update check for possible updates.\n\nBe sure to enable the encryption feature.  If you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors can't go snooping through your stuff.  Or worse, lift the signal, and ultimately your personal information.\n\nI've had no problems with my current set-up.  I HIGHLY recommend this card to bring your laptop/desktop up-to-date\n"

aS"\tIt's called the Ultra Mini for a reason!\n\tThis review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. \nThe cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. \n\nIn short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk\n"

aS'\tI love this player!\n\tFor those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording, this product is wonderful.  Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc.  It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one.\n\nOne of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section.\n\nI record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station\'s tape deck to my iRiver.\n\nFor those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it\'s a little trickier.  You have to set the record input before -- you can\'t change it on the fly.\n\nI\'ve recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on.  Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show.  Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show.\n\nI\'ve also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results.  A bit of trial and error which I\'m still refining with later iRiver products.\n\nThe single AA batter lasts a good long time.  Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low.  If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved!\n\nThe negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive.\n\nFiles are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer.  I don\'t know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file.  But you can\'t trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don\'t think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another.\n\nAlso, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way.\n\nI\'ve had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes.  I\'m only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button.  After so many presses, it\'s starting to wear out.  But it\'s still working reliably.  I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention.\n\nI have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great.  I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it.  Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs.\n\nI\'m quite happy with iRiver and plan on buying from them in the future\n'

aS"\tLove satellite radio\n\tI got this for hubby and me over the summer.   We used it for our trip to Rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it.   WE have a tape deck in the car and used it w/ a cassette adaptor.  We had not problems whatsoever, in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter.   \nI did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next, but i don't think anybody can improve upon that.  I had the same problem w/ my itrip.  \nWe chose sirius for several reasons...i liked the classic vinyl station, my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in 2007.\nThe only problem i had was i couldn't read the red lettering in the daylight w/ the sunglasses on, but i didn't give them less than 5 stars because of this.  \nthis is the way to go, plus it has a suction mount, not a permanent mount. \nalso, if you look on ebay, someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat!!\ndefinitely go satellite, the music is great and little/ no commercials depending on the stations.\n"

After 6 years I buy the same one everytime. Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can't seem to throw them out because it costed money. It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It's actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model. I abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year I think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost, broken or stolen.\n"

aS'\tAdorama Slinger Bag ** GREAT **\n\tI purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).\n\nThe Adorama Slinger Bag is a great travel bag. It is light weight and has great utility.  I highly recommend it.\n'

aS"\tA Solution That Works\n\tI have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) \n\nThe variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. \n\nThe only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won't regret it.\n"

aS"\tBuffer Marks\n\tI use the pink circles to buff the cd/dvd, and it leaves the circular marks all over the cd, as I thought it would. Well, I thought that those marks would disappear after I used the repair paste with the yellow circles, but they're still there. Is it supposed to be like this? The reason I bought the thing was to make the cds look like new, but now they just look even more scratched with the buffer marks all over.\n\nCould someone answer this question for me please\n"

aS'\tRepairs discs to useable condition as described\n\tWith boys aged 2  and  3, and some poor disc storage procedures when I\'m driving, it appeared I was in need of one of these units.  Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn\'t take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children\'s cds in the car I don\'t always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  I\'m very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped.  \n\nThis product repairs a disc to "useable" condition, it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible.  I can still see, but not necessarily feel the scratches.  It\'s also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance.  If a disc plays well, but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair.  \n\nI agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.  I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use.\n'

aS"\tGreat deal for the money!\n\tI've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed. THIS IS NOT TRUE if you're carefull.  First of all, my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned OFF when you change the batteries.  Pretty simple, huh?  Also, don't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it. The main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner, and I just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10%.  I primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and I love it\n"

Lot's of features\n"
p892
aS'\tUnit works great, software hogs resources\n\tThe unit itself works great.  Much faster transfers than using the usb cable directly to my camera.  However, the software includes a "monitoring" feature, which checks every second or so, to see if you\'ve plugged in a card.  I opened up Windows Task Manager to discover that, each time it checked, it was consuming 25% of system resources (on/off each second).  No wonder my computer has been slower lately, especially if I have my image editing software open (duh).\n\nMy recommendation would be to skip the San Disk software and access the card reader directly from My Computer, as mentioned in another review below\n'

aS"\tMP3 Player is good\n\tThis unit is a good buy.  It is priced low, but functions like you paid a higher price.  The negatives are that it isn't compatible with Itunes, and the earphones are not very ergonomically designed.  Overall, it is a good product\n"

aS"\tGreat AM reception -- assume you'll be buying new earphones\n\tI'll try to keep this short and sweet.  If you have been frustrated trying to get AM reception on the go, then you've found the right radio for you.  I can't tell you how many pieces of junk I've bought that barely pulled-in even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception.   Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker, just like transistor radios of the 50's and 60's--a seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound, even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.   There might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to FM exclusivey, but if you spend even a little time on the AM dial, I really don't think you have a choice but to pick up this radio\n"

aS'\tGood but can be annoying\n\tThis was my second DLO transpod. I had an older white one that I bought used. I figured I would "upgrade" to this one since my iPod and my car\'s interior are black. overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one, but with a few little changes.\n\nFor one the output of this unit is much lower than its older counterparts. That normally doesn\'t matter if you choose a good empty frequency, but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect. \n\nNext, I can\'t turn it up any where near the volume I used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static. It seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it.\n\nLast, the most annoying part of this whole product, is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use. I have paused my iPod to take a phone call only to have very loud (since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume) static and sometimes radio stations coming through. Very embarrassing. Or when you stop your car and then come back, as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise.\n\nSince my car doesn\'t leave me many options for stereo replacement, this is the best product for my specific situation, though I may try and get that old one back from my friend...maybe an "upgrade" to a newer one will settle the deal\n'

aS'\tA Great Receiver for the Price\n\tThis receiver is a replacement for an older, more expensive, defective Sony that I had.  It was easy to install and performs comparably well with more expensive units.  I am satisfied with the product\n'
p901
aS'\tHome Theater Solution\n\tThe reviews sounded too good to be true.  The reviews are right on.  This system is perfect for home theater.  I have the latest Panasonic plasma.  This receiver is the perfect compliment.  Here is why...\n\nI could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.\n\nTons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection.  Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  \n\nReally easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.\n\nDid I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.\n\nBest of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.\n\nThe end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver\n'
p902
aS"\tWorks Great\n\tThis item does exactly what it's suppose to do. It also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception. Worth the money. Only drawback would be, there is a lot of cord hanging around\n"
p903
aS'\tBudget solution. In no means good sound without tweaks.\n\tThe Sony SS-MF650H are a low-cost solution to good directional sound for a very small room.\n\nThough I have not had the opportunity to test the ultra-high (up to 50kHz) frequency, the highs on these speakers sound very well, maybe only slightly boxy - note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread.\n\nThe sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space, especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However, don\'t get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more "sustain" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.\n\nThe bass is very punchy, and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers, as their highs are very good, and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don\'t worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won\'t suffer). In other words, you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out-of-the box quality.\n\nIgnore the 50kHz rating for ultra-high-frequency sound as a positive feature, as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz, at a reasonable RMS.\n\nYou get what you pay for... for the price tag on them, the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound), and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them), the sound quality suffers.\n\nI would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you\'re willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound.\n\nI also demo-ed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB-404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady, but excellent for the price - seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you\'re looking for deep and bass-heavy sound without a sub-woofer, and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your "budget solution" instead of the SS-MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though, so if you have a big room shop around for something better.\n'
p904
aS"\tExcellent sound, great price\n\tI listen to a wide range of music, from hard rock, techno/electronic, to classical, and I've found it difficult to locate reasonably priced speakers that can handle all of this -- at least until I ordered this set.  I was apprehensive about buying online (and also about the Sony brand for speakers), but I'm very happy with this purchase.  I've been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends - the highs are crisp and the bass is tight, not boomy.  The soundstage is expansive (of course, this depends a lot on your receiver as well) and imaging good.  I'd definitely recommend this speaker set\n"

aS"\tGood product\n\tThis first time I use the HD product in my home video system and have the expected results.

aS'\tNewer Model Region-Free Code!!\n\tI bought my player Sep 2006 and the other region-free code did not work.  It is actually a DVD-224M (see manual) though it says DVD-224 on the player.  Here is how to do it:\n\nIf you have the DVD-224M model (says DVD-224 on the box, DVD-224M on the manual...), the hack is: \n\nMake sure you have no DVD in the tray. \nOn the remote control: \n1) Press "TITLE" \n2) Press "1" and then "9" \nOn the TV a large box with a small number will appear. \nThe number indicates for which DVD region the machine has been set, for example "2" for Germany or "0" for no region code. \n3) Press the up arrow or down arrow to raise or lower the number. \n4) Press "ENTER" \nDone.\n'

aS'\tTrust the description.\n\t(Despite some of the negative reviews of this item, it continues to perform well with my regular-sized iPod.  In fact, it has more volume, depth, and presence than three other portable speakers--each costing 50 to 75% more--to which I\'ve compared it.  The only downside is that the item is no longer sold postage-free from Amazon, diminishing its "bargain" appeal somewhat.)\n\nThese modest-sized and priced speakers perform as advertised: the sound is more than adequate; they\'re small enough that I can take The Stephen Colbert Report  with me on walks; when not in use, they fold up into a mini Porta-John. My only misgiving is whether I should have spent 2-3X more for a unit with a dock connector. But for under twenty bucks you simply won\'t find a better sounding, more compact unit\n'

This headset sits gently over my head with the earpiece lying on my ear.  I'm told I can be heard very clearly without echo or fadeout.  I would highly recommend this headset\n"
p916
aS"\tDanny\n\tI think this is as good as the expensive over $60 HDMI cables.  I wouldn't spend money on the expensive ones.  First of all, I'm not a cable junkie nor an expert.  However, according to my research, there's no difference in performance b/w the expensive version nor the $12, $15, $20 version when it comes to HDMI since it's all digital.. hole buch of zeros and ones.  The durability of the cables... I don't know.  But unless you're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason, it wouldn't matter.  Normally, you'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time, so the durability is not really relevant.  Bottomline: This is as good as the expensive ones.  I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $85.  Then I returned it after purchasing this, for the quality was the same.  Don't buy the expensive ones\n"

aS'\tGreat detail in these inexpensive phones\n\tI have been using these for a while now and they seem pretty good to me.  (disclaimer: I am not an audio professional, nor do I have any expensive headphones to compare with.)\n\nThey have great detail in both low and high end. In fact, I can hear things in some of my music that I never noticed before in either my small speakers or in the several foam on-ear style or earbud styles.  This is good when listening to original CDs, or HQ mp3/AAC, but it did reveal  some audio glitches and artifacts in lower quality mp3 that I had just not heard before...\n\nI tested these with a frequency response program on my Mac, show as having 25-15,600 Hz (in my ears, your ears may vary...) .  This range is better than most of my other inexpensive headphones and earbuds.\n\nThey do a good job of blocking out external noises-- great if you are in a bit of a noisy space.\n\nAnd, yes, they were a bit tight on the head initially.  To fix that, I got a stack of cd/dvd cases that was a bit wider than my head and allowed these headphones to be expanded by them for several overnight stretches (pun intended). This has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now OK to wear for long periods.  NOTE: this procedure is at your own risk, as I do not think it is officially endorsed by the mfg.  ;-)   Do not overstretch them, as the headband material, while flexible, undoubtedly has limits to the stretch it can take.\n\nGreat Bargain Headphones\n'

aS"\tSuperb Sound Quality\n\tNot an audiophile, but someone looking to spend a decent amount of money on a quality set of headphones. This product nails all the requirements - great sound, great comfort, well built. I'll be buying more of these guys for friends and family.\n"

aS"\tUninstall the U3 and it's fine\n\tDon't let the reviews fool you. At this price, it's worth a little research. Apparently U3 is annoying a lot of people and the people at U3 have created an uninstall download for you to get. So Google it, download it, and buy the USB drive. The size of this USB drive and the fact that you'll never have to worry about losing the cap along with an excellent price make it worth buying. After you uninstall the U3 software, it works like any other drive. It works great, it just takes you ten minutes of a little extra work. \n\nI'm very satisfied so far and have carried audio, video, and a lot, lot more  on a drive the size of a pen cap. Brilliant...\n"

aS'\tMore than I was expecting\n\tI bought these headphones a week ago and I am very pleased with them. At the electronic store, I listen to 3 pairs of Sennheiser (HD-433 ; HD-437 and HD-457). I hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 (10 more buck$). At the store the sound was OK as they were playing from the Sennheiser display rack. When I got home, I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on "headphones" and played "Metallica- Nothing else matters" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.\nI do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but I found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. The sound is better on  my computer than on my Harman Kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my MP3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.\nOverall, I would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. They blow away all the competition in the same price range. Compared to my old Panasonic, it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.\nWhen it comes to music, I love bass a lot but I would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer), so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.\nVery good headphones ... Go get a pair ... at this price you can`t go wrong. I highly recommand them for computer users (music, DVD movies and games)\n'

The process has been slow mainly because of the price and availability of Apple products:  High and Scarce.\n\nThe best thing about Apple is that their customer forums are full of people like you and me, and if you have a problem, someone else has most likely had it, too.  Those forums helped in my decision to purchase this monitor.\n\nI had been looking closely at the 23" monitor.  When I read about a majority of the displays getting a pink tint after only a few hours of use, I realized I would either wait until Apple re-engineered the monitor, or look at other options.\n\nWith the 20" Aluminum, I didn\'t have to look far.  I wanted a monitor that would compliment my G4 laptop (Powerbook), but I didn\'t want to break the bank, either.  The answer was turning to ebay.  $600 out the door.  Mint condition.  Saved over $150, and the monitor works and looks great!\n\nThe 20" and 30" models have had no problems.  If you can buy them new, go for it.  If you can buy new, but would rather spend that extra money on something else, check out the ebay auctions\n'

aS"\tNext Best Thing to a Built-in Connector\n\tIt's not listed in the product description but the Pico works with the iPod Mini too.  Like the other reviewers, I found it easy to setup: tune the radio, turn on iPod, connect the Pico, tune the Pico, done).  In my car, the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio.  I noticed this as well with my home stereo. Maybe the next generation Pico needs a larger antennae, or my iPod needed charging.  Regarding sound quality, my other car has a built-in iPod connector.  The Pico sound quality is comparable, somewhat muted, but enjoyable.  The Pico does offer the advantage of displaying the iPod menu to select tunes.  I've read mixed reviews on other FM transmitters, but I am pleased with the Pico\n"

aS'\tExcellent for what I use this for\n\tI ordered this device to sit on a player piano, which can play ipod encoded MP3 files, once they are transferred from the special CDs that are designed for the piano.  The remote is limited, as are all remotes for ipods, but for the special use I have, this is a great product.  It allows me to sit across the room and pause the piano or select the next piece of music\n'

aS'\tGood capability, fair price\n\tI was looking for an inexpensive, yet high quality, long lasting, and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane. A fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace. The Brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly. Offering two lines of crisp, highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact, I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750, I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past! My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.  The Brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on AA battery power alone, so I have not felt the need to purchase the adapter\n'
p936
aS'\tMaybe other reviewers were talking about another phone.\n\tWe recently purchased 4 of these phones and all of them work fine. The CID works perfectly for both lines. The interface/menu takes a few minutes to learn and get used to but I wouldn\'t call it "non-intuitive".\n\nThe Redial button (as you can see in the picture) is right above the number pad. If you can\'t find it, you might want to buy a phone with less buttons and less features. And it\'s pretty simple to redial a number in the CID display... when you see/get to the number press Enter twice (Once to bring up the "MENU", and Once more to "DIAL"). In fact you can also save that number into the phone\'s memory through the menu (press Enter once and scroll through the options)\n'

aS"\tVery nice product\n\tAt first, I was not sure about if this Windshield Mounting Bracket was going to stay in place while I drive trough the streets. However, I was very surprised when I found out that the Bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another, even under some vibration. The suction rubber system is quite strong. It has 2 angles for adjustment, and you can rotate the GPS clockwise/counterclockwise.\n\nPros: Strong suction rubber system, GPS mounting system\nCons: Lack of a 4th angle for adjustment (the GPS can only be adjusted in the windshield plane, so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing - that's why I give 4 stars\n"

aS'\tGarmin Etrex Windshield Mounting Bracket\n\tVery strong suction cup provides secure mounting. Quick and easy clip in and release for taking the GPS with you.

aS'\tHeight dimensions inaccurate\n\tThe forums speak highly of these units-xr70, and I was going to get one because of the small form factor. Amazon\'s description for the height at 2.5" is incorrect, according to Panasonic\'s website. Should be listed as 3 9/32"H. Makes a difference if you\'re short on space\n'
p940
aS'\tI just love this system\n\tI was paranoid about having buyer\'s remorse from this unit. For such a cheap price I was sure I would end up regretting the purchase. What is the tradeoff? Shoot if know, but I haven\'t regretted buying it one bit. The receiver is perfect for home theater, particularly DD 5.1 shows. There is absolutely no discernable speaker hiss with digital content, which is important for TV watching that has a high range of both loud and silent moments.\n\nAs for power, it\'s not an even match with some of the more power hungry and expensive analog amplifiers out there, but it easily crosses the threshold of annoying the neighbors.\n\nDigital is something to get used to. On conventional receivers, you turn the sound up high and it becomes somewhat sloppy, or what some call "warm". Not so with the digital Panny. It\'s distortion free up to very high levels. I wouldn\'t call it bright, but the response is very linear and precise. I like hearing all the details in music and cinema, even at loud volume. Others don\'t.\n\nThe weaknesses are very minor:\n\n-The FM tuner is nothing special.\n-It lacks fancy DSP modes of expensive receivers.\n-No fancy on screen display (must do most of the tweaking with knobs)\n-It does not upconvert video.\n-The remote control is an el cheapo.\n\nFor this price, though, who cares\n'

aS"\tThe Best I've Seen!\n\tI've had 2 other FM transmitters (A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip). Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don't need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn't be happier\n"

aS'\tlow price and get the job done\n\tat such low price, this player is really pretty good.\n\nit gets the job done, even though the UI is a little bit basic.\n\nit can record in DVD+R and DVD-R, and has a 10 hour mode.  Although in the 10 hour mode, image is not so clear but still pretty good if view on the computer using 320 x 240 resolution.\n\nand at such a low price, you can get two or three to record different programs and archive some shows, and it is still cheaper than the Media Center PC.  Good thing is the disc is already a DVD playable in any player.  No need to burn it as opposed to if you are using Tivo or Media Center PC.\n'

aS'\tIncredible Headphones\n\tI\'ve had these headphones for just over two years, and I\'m happy to see that they\'re one of the few pairs marketed as "surround sound" that have done quite well. The reason behind that is because they\'re truly excellent headphones. The range is spectacular and the inputs even more so. You\'re given the option of RCA and Toslink (optical), which is all you really need. \n\nMovies really do sound like movies...you hear things behind, in front, and to your left and right when you\'re connected via optical. Take note that DTS also sounds \'boomier\' and a tad crisper than Dolby D does, especially in Gladiator. \n\nHonestly, I\'ve nothing to complain about. As a college guy, I couldn\'t bring my 1010 watt system from home. Which, I might add, never sounded as good as my headphones, mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically. Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things. You\'d be amazed at Coldplay\'s "The Scientist" if you heard it on these headphones. It\'s indescribable.\n\nAnd by the way, I\'m a slight audiophile.\n\nYou seriously can\'t go wrong with these headphones. And $65 for each additional pair of headphones, allowing you to add as many as you want to one base station? Even better...good idea for families in apartments.\n\nIncredibly advanced technology, incredible sound, and incredible results. Can\'t go wrong here.\n\nOh, and they\'re extremely comfy\n'

aS"\tLove 'em!\n\tI found the sound fantastic. Just got these after usinf Shure E3s for about a year. I liked those but find these even better. When I first tried them I found the base so much stronger than the E3s as many have alluded to. Now I run my iPod at normal equalizer settings. I find the balance of the set dead on. The fit is great, of course your milage may vary. In fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable. This means when I walk with them I can hear my footsteps. This would be a real problem if I jogged (low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected)\n"

aS"\tMuch better than the Belkin Tunebase FM\n\tThis is my second FM transmitter and works much better than the Belkin that I ended up returning because it simply wasn't working.\n\nIt plugs firmly into my cigarette lighter and stays there, unlike the Belkin (I drive a 2001 BMW 325ci). It is easy to use with the preset FM stations. It works right out of the box, you'll be ready to go within seconds. The sound is crisp, with some static interference, which can be expected in a big city. Unmounting my car's antenna helps a little but doesn't completely cure the interference. I have a factory BMW Business radio which picks up FM signals pretty much without an antenna.\nThere is nothing to mount the iPod so you'll either have to set it in your cup holder or purchase a case separately.\n\nI wouldn't spend more than $45 on any FM transmitter as there will always be minor interference in urban areas. I won't be getting rid of my CD changer just yet\n"

aS"\tAmazing PDA, Great Features at a Great Price!\n\tI have had my Axim x51v for about three months.  I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase, extra 1100mAh battery, and auto power cord.\n\nStrengths: Just about everything.  The processor is absolutely incredible.  I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3!  It sure seems like it.  This PDA blazes through movies, photos, games, word processing, and anything else I can throw at it.  \nThe other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this, you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  \nThe battery life is phenomenal, even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours, extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  \nWiFi is amazing.  It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up.  Once connected, it keeps the signal well and is, while not fast, reasonable for speed\nJust about everything on this PDA is almost perfect.\n\nWeaknesses: Not enough programs to start with, Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP, it's way better)\n\nProblems: Don't use Odyssey Client, it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also, in ActiveSync, On the PDA, select Menu, Add Server Source.  On all of the screens, put random characters in each field, and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu, schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu, options, and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster, and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.\n\nConclusion: An awesome PDA that does just about everything.  Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse, and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability.  Everything works extremely well\n"

aS"\tBetter than Logitechs higher priced offering\n\tI'm very pleased with this camera.  I updated it with the new drivers and software on the Creative site (from January 2006) immediately and I have not had any of the problems others mention.  The image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true USB 2.0 camera. It will work with USB 1, but be sure you use USB 2.0 for better quality.\n\nVideo calls run a bit choppy if there is a lot of movement, but for basic conversations, it is fine.  I use 8 Mbs cable and I connect with people using the same or high speed DSL.\n\nThis camera takes great video  and  photos and has an excellent one click panoramic option that does all of the stitching for you.  If you want to take a large group shot, it is really cool.  The other features like security and remote monitoring are very useful as well.  I don't use the face tracking.  \n\nThe base deserves a mention too.  I use this on my notebook and on my desktop.  It's cool that the base works with both notebook screens and on flat surfaces.  Highly recommended for the price now with the current rebate Amazon is offering\n"

aV	Great mouse, mediocre keyboard.\u000a	I wanted a combo and this seems to be the best one on the market now days.\u000aThe mouse is very good, a tad small, but still very comfortable. Not as good as  Logitech\ufffd MX(tm)500 for my hand (I'd say I have a medium size hand), but still a very solid product. Side buttons are very useful. No need to install any additional drivers for XP if you are ok with the default behavior. Just plug it in and use.\u000aThe keyboard is so-so. It is not bad, but just not very comfortable, especially compared to Microsoft keyboards. (I use Microsoft 4000 for work and it really shines). The labeling is very small, Insert/Delete keys are not standard and I hate Vista ready button, if you hit it in the middle of the game you are lucky not to crash.\u000aWould I buy it again? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes, but with some reservations.\u000a

aS'\tGreat sound, some suggestions for durability\n\tLike most people here, I found the Bose Triport headphones to have excellent sound but the plastic on mine also broke in the recess next to the earcups.  What I found is that this is caused by the tension of the headband frame pushing into the plastic.  In fact, the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended.\n\nMy recommendation is to store these headphones with the earcups fully retracted, to reduce the tension of the headband frame on that piece of plastic.  Bose replaced them with no hassles, no receipt, no registration, just sent them back and got a brand new pair.  I think that was well worth the money spent over 2 years ago\n'

aS"\tGreat Speaker System\n\tI recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It's great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website).  I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it's playing or not.  There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto.\n"
p959
aS'\tawesome speakers!\n\tAgain, Creative Labs has combined all you need into one package: line in jack, usb port, fm antenna, and even a jack for a sub-woofer! for a small portable speaker, this system gets pretty loud and clear. The stereo effect button works great, the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the cons;like most reviewers,i too, have to say the bass is lacking a bit, and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily, but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price, this speaker system is very good.    \ni tried the Altec Lansing portable speakers for the same price and i returned it the next day. it didnt even get half as loud without distortion and it didnt have as many cool features either.\nright now, im using the speakers with the zen nano plus and it works great! im saving up for the zen micro now and if it sounds good with the nano, then i know the TravelDock will sound amazing with the micro that it was intended for.\n one more thing, if your going to use the line-in cable for a device other than the zen micro, be sure to insert the BLACK end of the cable into the device your want to play and the WHITE end into the speakers line-in jack. i read a reviewer who said the speakers sounded tinny like a transistor radio and its because she had the wrong ends of the cable attached. i did it myself and i figured it out. unlike the reviewer who returned the speakers before taking the time to learn how to use it before returning it and giving it a bad review. \nI love these speakers and i even use them for my t.v and they sound great for that too\n'

aS"\tGreat Speakers\n\tFor the cost, you can't go wrong with these speakers from Jensen. We love them, and in shopping around found them to be one of the best home theater values. The sound is great, and the speakers are perfect for just about any home theater need\n"

They make fabulous photo paper that is reasonably priced and prints GREAT photos.  \n\nI did a wedding album using Canon photo paper and the couple I gave it to thought that the photos were as good as the photographer they'd hired, which speaks volumes to the quality of Canon paper.\n\nI'd highly recommend that people use this brand.

aS"\tAmazing picture with one regret\n\tThis was the largest set that would fit into my space. I also looked at the Westinghouse 37 inch HD moniter at Best Buy. The first time, I looked at the Westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy. Then I read the review on CNET which said the Westinghouse picture was actually better than the Sharp. I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved. He said it was as it good as it could be. He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse, so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp.In any event, I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale. On HD, the picture is amazing. It's also quite good on regular TV. \nMy only regret is that Toshiba has just come out with a 37inch LCD with a DVD built in. If I  had known, I would have waited to check out that model\n"

aS"\tHigh-End Speaker Connectors\n\tI own a set of older Martin Logan speakers. Their quality is legendary with a price to match. So I was interested in maximizing performance. When I called their office for advice, one of the tech guys (excellent service, by the way) told me the Monster banana plugs were great, not the best or most expensive available, but a good value. That was enough for me. My speakers are bi-wired so I purchased two sets of four plugs. Installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful. Add to that the free shipping, no tax and a total price saving of $12.00 and you can't do better than Amazon!\n"

aS'\tNice buds for the price\n\tFor the background, I\'ve owned  and  used various IEM (In-Ear-Monitor) headphones over the years: Ety ER4p, Altec Lansing iM716, Shure E2c, Sony EX71, Koss KSC75.  Here\'s my quick impression after using these headphones for a week:\n\nPros:\n1. Very good bass  and  well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)\n2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I\'d need to crank up the vol.)\n3. Very light weight\n4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)\n5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p  and iM716 have better isolation)\n6. Moderately priced ($50)\n\nCons:\n1. Cables are thin so handle with care.\n2. Some people may not like the "phonendoscope effect" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.\n3. No pouch or case\n\nPS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80\'s experience :\n'

aS"\tExcellent iPod, my favorite so far.\n\tI love the new nanos. I don't think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me. I'd rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 star\n"

aS"\tHigher Quality Ink-jet Printable DVD discs\n\tThese Verbatim discs have the DataLife Plus layer of protection that will allow them to last 100+ years. I'm a professional photographer and it's crucial to store my client's digital photos and artwork onto a disc that will remain stable in years to come. I've tried many brands and types of discs and have lost data (read errors) many times but so far with the hundreds of Verbatim discs I've burned so far, I haven't had a problem yet. The Kodak brand discs were also excellent, but Kodak discontinued making them. SONY also makes a good disc. These discs can be printed on directly with an ink jet printer such as the Epson R200/R300/R320, and the surface area is printable right up to the hub! I have no reason to switch to any other brand as long as Verbatim continues to make a great disc\n"

aS'\tTwo Thumbs up for Quickcam Notebook Pro\n\tNotebooks Pro is the highest rated webcam (for notebooks) on the market and for good reason.  Audio and Video quality is excellent.  You can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem.  The echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams, especially with the use of video.  On the negative side the USB cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop.  Also, I have the Quickcam Fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall.  Logitech ships that product with Quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to Quickcam 9 the Notebook Pro uses.  Unfortunately, Logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues.  B\n'

aS"\tThank goodness I found these!\n\tI have been going nuts trying to find a decent set of headphones for my new iPod.  All I wanted was decent sound for a decent price, but after trying various models of ear-buds and standard phones and returning them all I figured I was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all.  But, then I decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be THE only choice for headphones- KOSS of course!  And man- they still have it.  These aren't the greatest phones I've ever heard, but for $20 (and it seems you can now get them for half that!) they easily compare to some well-known sets costing 3 times as much or more.  Finally, no awful hi-mid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer *cough cough Sony cough*.  They are fairly comfortable- I think I would rather have the traditional over-the-head band but you get used to these pretty quick.  These sound nice, full- the bass doesn't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it's smooth.  And most important, you can listen for hours without ear fatigue.  Without a doubt, these are the best budget phones I've ever owned!  My bottom line- anyone who doesn't grab these for $10 bucks a pop is insane.  Period *g\n"

aS'\tBest value for Fiber Optic Audio\n\tI\'ve bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase.  I\'ve used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems, TV, Cable Box, and Receiver/DVD Player.  (Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)\n\nI believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.\n\nWhat do you REALLY get for a "high end" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don\'t know.  I purchased one (which was "top of the line") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too.  Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified!\n\nWhat does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it:\n---\n"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance."\n\n---\nA digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn\'t degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\n\nOverall, I\'m very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)\n\n(P.S. for first time users, don\'t forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away; you\'ll never need them again.\n'

aS'\tGreat phone\n\tI have had this phone now about 3 months and I am VERY HAPPY with it. IT has all the things and want and many more, The hand sets are very clear and I love the fact I can check voice mail on any hand set that goes with it I do not have to run to the main answering machine to check the voice mail. The range of the hand sets is great had no problem at all with this.  So far I love everything with this phone, It is much better than either of the last two phone I have had. I have walked over a 1/2 block from the house and it still works clearly, I have never had a phone that worked so far away from home\n'

aS'\tNot bad, given the price I paid!\n\tI purchased the Notebook Cooler approximately one month ago, after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating. Thankfully, the same time I read that, Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15, after mail-in rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far: not bad... \n\nMy laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now, and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed, with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I\'ll admit, the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy, and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too "strong" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to "white noise," which you don\'t really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually, though, I only use the high setting when it\'s really hot in the room, or if I\'m running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. \n\nOverall, I\'d say I\'m very satisfied with this product. (Though, I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.)\n'

aS'\tFantastic mouse!\n\tWhat a relief to find this mouse after having bought a Microsoft 6000 lazer mouse which caused my tendonitis to flare up again really bad.  I had originally gotten really bad tendonitis from another Microsoft "ergonomic" mouse a year ago, which became chronic, but barely noticeable until I tried the 6000.\n\nI also tried a Logitech V200, which is a good mouse, just not nearly as comfortable as the 450.  The buttons on both of these Logitech mice press down really nicely and are effortless.  This was not so on the MS 6000.\n\nIf you are looking for the ultimate in a mouse for a notebook, the Logitech V450 is it.  My hands are fairly large, and for the $15 more than the v200, it is definitely worth it as I spend a lot of time on computers\n'
p1002
aS"\tGreat freaking mouse\n\tThis laser version tracks much better on odd surfaces compared to the Logitech V200 I have.\n\nThe Setpoint software allows you to use Setpoint's mouse sensativity independent of the touchpad settings.  Finally!!!  I dont have to change mouse sensativities when I unplug it.  The Setpoint sensativity is an offset to window's sensativity setting for the touchpad.  So basically, set your touchpad sensativity first, then adjust the Setpoint sensativity.  They will be work just the way you want everytime you unplug/plug the mouse and going back and forth between touchpad and mouse.\n\nPerfect product\n"

aS"\tGreat the device but you still need to know how to best use it!\n\tThis is a product too unique for me not too try.  I've struggling with lost receipts and always in a panic mode when tax day comes.  There's just no other easy way I've found to keep track of all my receipts.  \n\nEven with some of the negativity about the accuracy on the receipt recognition, I still wanted to try this out for myself.\n\nI noticed the following will increase the accuracy of the receipt scanning:\n\n1) Scan your receipt ASAP once you have it.  Receipts are pretty cheap in quality and will fade over time.  Also for that matter, you risk the chance of loosing the receipt the longer you don't scan it in.  =)\n\n2) Ink quality on the receipt matters.\nIt does the best job when the dots of the letters/number are together and dark.\n\n3)wording on the receipt.\ne.g. the receipt can say visa/mc then scanner will pick it as visa.\n\nBusiness card scans have been excellent for me.  Be sure to upgrade your sw to the lastest version.  Mine is 2.55 at the time of writing\n"

aS'\tGreat antenna for HDTV OTA\n\tI live in Manhattan on the 7th floor of an apartment building surrounded by taller buildings on all sides and this antenna provides great reception.

The cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light. I have it resting atop my center channel speaker. $20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks provide- especially for football\n'

aS"\tDoes the job\n\tThis is very comfortable and works very well.  It's heavy enough that it doesn't move around or push the keyboard, as some of the other types of wrist rests that I've used have done.  Yet it's cushiony while sturdy enough to provide support.\n"
p1008
aS"\tComfort for the keyboard\n\tI type medical reports for a living, up to 10 hours a day and 7 days a week. Without the wrist rest, my wrists would not be able to hold up. The wrist rest is the perfect size. It stays in place on the desk. The gel continues to be supportive, even after a year of working on it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell. I can't smell it while typing, only when I pick it up for cleaning. I wish there was the option for half stars - I'd give this 4-1/2 stars\n"

aS'\tBEST PRINTS EVER!\n\tI was debating over the PictureMate, Kodak Printer Dock 3, Sony DDP-FP50, and the HP Photosmart 475. I made the choice of the HP and I LOVE IT! The prints are 4800x1200dpi and look like real lab prints. I use the HP 4x6 boarderless Premium Plus photo paper with the HP Ink and the prints are just wonderful. Forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all. (...) The HP produces bright, vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime. The PictureMate is also alot larger than the HP 475. The 1.5GB hard drive is a plus as well. HP said that the remote is not included but they lied, they come with the remote and battery. Overall, this printer is the best I have own\n'

aS"\tExcellent Quality- But do read this\n\tThese DVDs are absolutely top quality, and you really need to use bad DVDs to know how bad they can get.  I ordered a pack a while ago and have burnt 7 discs so far.  Not a single coaster, and Nero data verification (I always do that for DVDs) has not brought up any errors ever.  BTW, the discs had a mixture of both large and very small files.  The burner is the DVD multi drive on my Dell Inspiron Laptop (1505).\n\nHowever, I should mention (to those who haven't bought this product) why they are called Shiny Silver.  You know that print on the top of DVDs with lines and that matte finish?  Well, there's no such thing on these DVDs.  The top looks a lot like the writing surface on the other side (other than the characteristic DVD color).  Anyone who has seen unbranded DVDs will know exactly what I'm talking about- No special surface; however  a felt tip marker works nicely to label the disks.  Huge cost cutting here I guess, but definitely not in the quality department.  I will buy again\n"
p1014
aS"\tI have to agree with many on this.......\n\tI burn a ton of DVDs and have used almost every brand out there.  Many have errors, even the top brand names like Memorex...etc.\n\nI have found the least amount of errors with this brand and the shelf life seems to be lasting.  \n\nI've switched all DVD media purchases to Verbatim.  They are by far, the best of them all.  Would recommend to everyone\n"

aS"\tSweet sounding plugs!\n\tFirst off, these puppies sound good! However, there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know:\n\nThe sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley, as with most in-ear headphones. The low end is there, but for full effect, it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves, this sweet spot is not very wide. That said, however, I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn't permit for either big speakers or special chambers, maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback, look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason \ni didn't give it five stars.\n\nAlso, the lack of colored LEFT (blue or white)  and  RIGHT (red) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time. I didn't realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check.  So be careful.\n\nRiding while using them can be dangerous, since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead. \n\nBang for the buck, ( I paid $69.99 on amazon), I really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados.\n"

aS"\tA very good DVD Recorder\n\tI like this unit. It is hooked up to an S-Video in from my Digital Cable Box, and uses a component video out to a Mitsubishi HDTV. Picture quality is very good; I'm very used to my high-quality Sony DVD player DVP-NS700P, but this one is very close. There is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the Cable box, but then I've not compared with other units. I think its more than acceptable. A DVD I burned played fine on the Sony..but...when I recorded one program, deleted it, and then recorded again, it would only play on an older Sony DVD player. My Sony DVD player is kind of touchy, anyhow. \nAll told, I'd recommend this DVD recorder without hesitation\n"

aS'\tBy Far The Best Multi On The Market Today\n\tI don\'t normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product.  You can\'t go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that "quick" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn\'t wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer\'s codes which they list in a handy guide.  If you are shopping for a multi recorder/player search no more get this one you won\'t be disappointed\n'

aS'\tIt;s my baby!\n\tI got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which, in my opinion, was a big mistake on Apple\'s part) and I absolutely love it! Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It\'s smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.\n\nIt holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it\'s still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother\'s mp3 player, needing to press "next" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it\'s job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.\n\nAnother huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod "family" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case, an iSkin which I have come to adore, high quality headphones and the iBass, which is another great speaker product for ipods. I\'ve actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that\'s how much I love it!\n\nFor having so many great features, this is priced very reasonably. Even when I got it and it was $200, I still felt that it was well worth the money. BUY THIS NOW!!!! it\'s amazing!\n'

aS'\tSimply the best trackball\n\tI haven\'t written any reviews for Amazon before, but when prompted for my feedback on this trackball, I had to respond.  I\'ve been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90\'s when Kensington first came out with the "Turbo Mouse".  It was great then, and now it\'s better.  This is as solid, smooth, and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don\'t understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand -- your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price, but frankly it\'s worth that.  It\'s a no brainer at $80 which is what I paid through Amazon to Tiger Direct.  If you need (or want) a high performance trackball that you\'ll be able to use with many computers to come, get this one\n'

aS"\tEASY  TO USE SCANNER FOR PDF FILES\n\tI work for a small sized consulting engineer's firm where everyday we have to scan some hundreds of pages of text (magazine articles, old projects, letters from the client, books, etc).\n\nWe got four years ago our first fujitsu scanner ( still working ) and we have been impressed with its speed, small size and since it wase easy to use to obtain good quality PDF files.\n\nA couple of years we moved to the scansnap series. We now have four of them.\n\nPROS :\n- incredibly easy to use ( you don't need to teach anybody )\n- fast for PDF scanning\n- great value for money ( includes acrobat 7.0 bundled )\n- very small, perfect for a desk\n- good construction quality, no one of our 4 scanners ever broke\n\nCONS :\n- quality of the feeding roller is good but not professional. If you have to scan hundreds of pages you have to be on the scanner to avoid paper jams, double-feeding that some time occurs.\n- not great quality for photographs scanning ( however difficult because it is not flatbed ).\n\nI strongly suggest it for small-medium sized businesses to scan documents.\n\nIf you have to scan hundreds of pages everyday or you need a high quality scanner for photos you can find something better.\n"

Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing)\n\nMy experience: I've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. \n\nRegardless of the flaws, I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep.\n"

aS'\tPlease READ before you run your mouth\n\tLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nJust a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy \'toys\' before exploring what it is that they\'re buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives, as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is that:\n\na- The U3 software has a way of stopping the software\'s auto-boot.\n\nb- There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com, and I\'m guessing that those company\'s that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the \'Uninstaller\' on their site.\n\nc- There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and pay-for-it) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site, so do Verbatim  and  Memorex.\n\nd- For those who want portable software but don\'t want U3 or don\'t have a U3 drive, go to http://portableapps.com.  Note: some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks, without using the U3 LaunchPad.\n\ne- Quality of drives: remember that when you buy most of the electronics \'toys\' available today, you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting "made in Japan quality" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods, also selling with No-Name labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line, different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC, and the destruction of goods that don\'t meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life, ya gets whats ya pay for.\n\ng- Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0, et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs, there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent \'roll-back\' feature.  And also the reason many, if not MOST, power users run multiple machines.  Of course, these days we have to fill Billy G\'s pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines, each one with a different use.  It shouldn\'t be this way, but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software, for many purposes (MP3\'s, scanning, Video, controlling radios, composing music, et al), one machine won\'t cut it because XP ain\'t as stable as folks think.  The more programs, and the more varied in type, the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003, because there are less software \'toys\' that run under 2K, and the \'admin\' can prevent you from loading a lot of software \'toys\'.\n\nh- In the end, understand what you are buying before you buy so that you\'ll have better luck getting what you want, and you won\'t look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong, or just plain stupid.\n\ni- When you truly understand the product, you\'ll be able to write TRULY useful reviews, and that what all readers want, useful information.\n\nTo one and all, may your \'toys\' keep you happy\n'

aS'\tWireless LAN USB antenna\n\tVery easy to use. Expend my wireless network access from two marginal to five with very good signal level. No external power required. Highly recomend it.\n'
p1030
aS'\tEasy to Install, Easy to Use\n\tCould not have been easier to install - literally just put the included CD in the drive, and plug the device into your USB 2.0 port.  Installed and self-configured in minutes.  Very small, light, no additional power cords to worry about, no additional software (beyond the automatically installed drivers) to install - quick and easy.  Only issue I found is that the antenna is permanent, so you could never swap for replacement/better antenna like you can on some other wireless NICs\n'

aS'\tVery Durable\n\tThis cover is very durable, however it is somewhat difficult to get the ipod into the case.  The case covers the entire ipod except for small vent holes so it is very water resistant, but the case covers the locking button making it harder to lock and unlock the ipod\n'

aS'\tA nice whole house telephone system\n\tI purchased this answering machine with the intention of expanding the quantity of phones to cover the entire house. To start, I bought only one additional phone. I\'ll buy the rest later. So far I am very pleased. The sound quality is excellent and there are numerous bonus features that I have found very useful. Like the talking caller ID and being able to screen messages from any of the phones. I also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering (download) a single entry or the entire list to the other phones. And each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom.\n\nYou can name the phones for the rooms they will occupy which will help when you use the intercom to call a specific room. So you would page the "Living Rm" rather than phone #3, etc.\n\nIf you have caller ID, you can program special rings and special call ID colors for the callers in your phone directory but that information must be programmed into each phone. It doesn\'t transfer when you download the directory to the other phones. \n\nAlso, on another Panasonic wireless phone that I own, the incoming call displayed the name I had programmed into the phone directory. Just like your cell phone will say "home", etc. On this phone, the caller ID displays the telephone company info only. \n\nI think the phone is great, I just wanted to clarify some points that are not crystal clear in the literature.\n'

aS'\tWonderful idea, with good tech support\n\tThis little device is a great invention from HP.  I had problems installing the unit and was on the telephone with HP Tech support (India) for 1.75 hours, I spent very little time on hold.\n\nThe largest draw back to the unit is my computer acts like the DC4000 is not there from time to time and required me to reboot the computer in order to use this nifty device\n'

aS'\tGreat speaker value --lower cost, higher performance\n\tI recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s, an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. \n\nThe E20s and E30s are listed as "Bookshelf Speakers." The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s, the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each, not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY! 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs!) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. \n\nI am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers, the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up, the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. \n\nI also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.\n\nMy biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes, not as good as the E20s, but still very good. As I write, I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi\'s 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan, the BPO and Anne-Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels, I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. \n\nI bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large, heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response, and I liked the Advents! Over time, our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10,000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website!) It all depends on what your budget is. The JBLs are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded\n'

aS"\tThe Headphone to compare all others to.\n\tI have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of  and quot;over-the-head and quot; headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can't beat that price\n"
p1043
aS"\tIt's very good\n\tThis is an affordable option that provides a lot of memory and allows USB 2.0 protocol for very fast transfer. If you need to transfer data from one digital product to another, this is very handy and I think that every person dealing a lot with data should have one.\n"
p1044
aS'\tExcellent value for money!\n\tI basically bought these because they were cheap. Cheap things are not always bad and these headphones are a great example. The UR-20 provides excellent sound for both music and movies. It has excellent bass and sound isolation. I am by no means an audiophile but I know good sound when I hear it and these headphones produce great sound, especially for its price.\n'
p1045
aS"\tFor the price, tough to beat\n\tNot a bad battery deal. While they don't last as long as some other batteries I've tried, their cost per battery more than makes up for it. For those that care about such things, they contain no mercury, no cadmium, and are made in China\n"

aS"\tWonderful - No more Carpal Tunnel Problems\n\tI've had this keyboard a number of years and would never go back to anything else. I have (or had) severe carpal tunnel syndrom. This keyboard has eliminated that problem entirely. I can't think of a downside. Yes, it takes a bit of getting used to and yes, the keys are a bit noisy. But I have no problem with that. It just reminds me I'm working.\n\nThe number pad is excellent too.\n\nI'm getting ready to get another one to use with my laptop.\n\nYou can't destroy this keyboard. If you value your wrists and hands, get this\n"

aS'\tgreat phone\n\tWe previously had an AT and T cordless w/answering machine (1 handset) and always had trouble locating the one receiver - kind of like misplacing the TV remote. With 3 handsets, we are spoiled. Also our house has a few phone jacks but they are all located where we did not want a phone and no jacks in our den or living room. With the abilty to locate the phones anywhere in the house where there is an outlet, we were able to place one in our living room and another in our bedroom (which we can turn the ringer off).\n'

aS'\tEverything you want in a corded phone!\n\tCorded phones with features are becoming harder to find now-a-days.  My home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages, mobile phone down for whatever reason, etc.  This is one of the few corded phones with caller ID and no answering machine built in.  The greatest feature of this phone is it has a HOLD button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless, etc.  Also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen.  Highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house\n'

aS"\tWOW!!!!!!!!\n\tWow, who would've thought that you could get such amazing products, at affordable prices.  The staff's friendly and responds quickly to any questions that you may have.  This is one amazing phone system (Uniden TCX905), I forgot that it's a cordless.\n"

aS"\tI payed my $45 for these headphones and enjoyed them.\n\tI'm going to cover compatiblity, sound, and comfort.\n\nOVERVIEW.\n\nAlthough I wish these were as cheap as the IPOD, $39 + $6 shipping isnt bad either. I have done the heat treatment (using boiling water) and the headphones seemed to open up more. When the headphones came in the box, the ear pieces were really close together. So I can easily see how these bands can crack easily when put on your head.\n\nI plan to heat treat these again to spread them out more.\n\nSOUND.\n\nSound quality is excellent.\n\nCOMFORT.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like is this style of headphone. I don't really like the band to go around the back of my head, causing my ears to support the headphones. I like the ones that go over the top of your head.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY.\n\nI have a Inspiron DELL Laptop and these suckers can connect to it easily without using a transmitter. These can also connect to just about any MP3 player of all sizes (PSP also) because it comes with a small 8 mm jack extension cord.\n\nFEATURES.\n\nCoolest features with this compared to my other IR sony wireless headphones is that this can go through walls! About 3X feet away\n"
p1052
aS'\tNot the most comfortable, but work great ...\n\tI am overall quite pleased with these headphones.  The sound quality is excellent.  I\'ve not had any problems with interference, background hiss or anything of that nature.\n\nBattery life has been excellent.  I have not actually ran them all the way down to see just how long they\'ll last, but I use them to listen to music at work for the better part of 8 hours a day and they haven\'t failed me yet.\n\nThe only reason I would not give them 5 stars is that they can be a little uncomfortable after prolonged use.  I\'m not really a big fan of this "sport" style of headphone, and probably wouldn\'t have tried these if I hadn\'t gotten them on clearance.  But, I found that after experimenting a little I was able to get them situated to feel pretty comfortable, even wearing them the better part of a workday\n'

aS'\tGood quality product and Nice design\n\tThe keyboard is good quality and the best product I could find for the price. I recommend if you are looking for a low profile keyboard w/numeric entry pad that takes a mimimum anount of desk space.  The keypad has the feel of a large notebook computer.  So makes a great docking station keyboard if you are used to the slim kepads on most modern laptop computers.\n'

aS'\tA FINE monitor for a very fair price\n\tFirst off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\n\nInstallation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\n\nOne big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn\'t true with all ViewSonics).  And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic\'s claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn\'t sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it\'s going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  This is a really a fine monitor!\n\nNow for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven\'t purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I\'m comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn\'t worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It\'s not bad, but it\'s going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\n\nAs with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things.  However, I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer\'s website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly.\n\nAll in all, I\'m very impressed so far, and I\'m really looking forward to using this monitor!  By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  I can\'t complain about that speed!  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure!  Anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor\n'

aS"\tGreat Access Point - after firmware upgrade\n\tI'm using this AP, along with a Netgear 802.11g PC Card to test streaming live/recorded TV to other parts of my house.  Seems like a capable product even if I didn't use the 108Mbps feature.\n\nHowever, be sure to update the firmware or the AP might not work correctly.  When I first received it, configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my Netgear and HP Centrino notebook.  Both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an IP address from my network's DNS server.  A firmware upgrade solved the problem and the AP now streams TV realibly from my living room to the kitchen.\n\nI noticed that there is are hordes of wireless APs around my house, I guess most neighbours are using some form of 802.11 wireless as well.  However, this D-Link AP is able to function correctly abeit all the other APs around (2 using the same channel as mine I've found).\n\n\nOverall, recommended if you want a good AP.  Just be sure to update the firmware\n"

aS"\tBest 5.8GHz I've tried though still not as good as 900 MHz DSS\n\tThe sound quality is pretty darn good, except that if you pace around while talking/listening, there are these annoying clicking/scratching sounds.  They are quite, and, if you stand still they go away.  I've had other phones that click/scratch while pacing around, and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking - at least this phone doesn't do that.  \n\nMy 900 MHz DSS Uniden didn't have these sounds (while pacing or otherwise), and still had greater range.  I don't know why the new technology can't measure up.  Still though, this is the best 5.8 I've tried.  (Yet I'd rather buy another 900MHz DSS if there were any on the market anymore.  All of today's 900MHz are analog instead of digital.)\n\nAnother annoying thing is that you can't recharge the phone with the belt clip attached, so the clip goes on and off (and on and off).  (Many (cell) phones have a charger that allows this.)\n\nThe plastic is a bit cheap.  Don't drop this phone.  My friend has one and it hasn't worked since it was dropped.\n\n(I haven't tried the bluetooth yet, and have yet to see how good the battery life is.\n"
p1057
aS"\tworks great with other handsets\n\tI got this base and added 6 TCX805 handsets to it.  The whole setup works great.  I got this base because it supports bluetooth through to my cell phone.  That features works well, there's a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that's trivial.  I will say this, you need to keep your cell phone within about 20' of this base.  I just take mine off, turn on Bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base.\n\nSo if you want the cell dialing feature and like the more traditional upright handset, get this base and expand it with other handsets.\n"
p1058
aS"\tGreat Headset for me\n\tThis is a great headset for my use.  It is very clear.  I use it for work, and I only make use it periodically throughout the day, making about 10 calls daily so I don't wear it all the time\n"
p1059
aS'\tExcellent LCD!\n\tResearched a lot before I bought this TV and for the money, this one was hands down the best 32" LCD.   Also, Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues.   \nI mainly use this TV for my XBOX 360.  You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same.   The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well.  I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all, after owning the tv for about 2 months now, I couldn\'t be happier.   To get around the poor speakers, I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  \nI\'ve also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable.  HD channels have a very good picture over the air.  Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable.  There\'s also a nice Antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the Over the Air Antenna.  \nThe only drawbacks to the TV are the 1 component input and the fact you can\'t use the PIP with the cable connected, only the antenna.\n'

aS"\tReally grew on me.\n\tI had a Zen Vision:M but I returned it because I decided I didn't need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and I wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player, so I decided to go with the Zen V since it's interface is almost identical to that of the Zen Vision M's(which I liked).\n\nThe first thing you will notice is the physical design.  Initially I wasn't that impressed, but it's really grown on me.  The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device, and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.\n\nThe music is organized your standard Artist-Album-Song interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion. Still, it's as simple as you can get I suppose.  The device officially supports album art although it seems to be very hit-or-miss in that regard in my experience. The screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight.\n\n The middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard, although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push.  A dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top.  \n\nThe player syncs with WMP11 via USB connection.  Syncing it is a snap although I was not impressed with the transfer speeds. Also, if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer, album art will not be attached to the music tracks.\n\nIf you are a newbie to buying MP3 players make note of the different sized models.  The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.  Most of my files are mid bit-rate WMAs and I can fit about 500 songs on the player, half as much as advertised.  \n\nSummary:\n\nPros:\nExcellent physical design\nEasy to use interface\nGood navigation\nGreat sound quality\n\nCons:\nOn-the-go playlist creation is flawed\nAlbum art support hit-or-miss\nSlow transfer speeds from WMP11\nAccesories rarely available in brick-and-mortar stores\n\nUltimately, I recommend the Zen V over the iPod nano mostly on the strength of it's vastly superior physical design.\n"

aS'\tPinnacle of 2.1 PC speakers, best for their price\n\tFor reference, I\'ve owned a set of Labtec APX-6420 2.1 speakers for about 6-7 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models, listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major "PC speaker" makers, I recall sampling Altec Lansing, Logitech, Klipsch, Bose, Creative, and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular "home" situations.\n\nI initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1\'s because of the fantastic reviews they\'ve gotten on Amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend\'s ProMedia 4.1\'s (which neither I nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\n\nI tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z-5500\'s which I own and love)! The bass especially sucks on their speakers.\n\nSo... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so, it had to be the FX6021\'s which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they\'re probably worth it. These speakers a very nice!\n\nThe sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno, though that sounds good too).\n\nSubwoofer is NOT "boomy" or "buzzy" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It\'s very deep, rich, and discrete. Doesn\'t shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain--yes, I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass: maybe you shouldn\'t have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective, but those reviews just don\'t sound right to me.\n\nPROs:\n* Tall, sleek, and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.\n* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.\n* Power button on control pod\n* This is important: NO BUZZING. Not while they\'re on, not while they off. 100% silent.\n\nCONs:\n* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in "notches"; these notches aren\'t always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.\n* Remote is a bit useless\n* While they look good and perform well, they feel a little cheap\n* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand, long cables are a PRO as well)\n\nAnd finally, don\'t be fooled by specs. Yes, other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification, but that really doesn\'t matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn\'t pay any attention to the specs, I bought them because they sound the best\n'

aS"\tworks pretty well with stereo hook-up\n\tMy sound improvement wasn't as dramatic as many people describe, likely because I already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers, but I did notice an improvement over the integrated system I have once I made some adjustments. If you listen to rock, pop, blues or jazz, this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier. It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3's, though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo, I'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound, but it might\n"

aS'\tWOW\n\tI wondered what kind of mouse I would get for $60.  I kept thinking, what could be so special about it.  Well, I don\'t know where to begin.  I like it so much, I\'m getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work.  I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I\'d never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed.  This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame.  It took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but I soon caught on.  I really didn\'t care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it.  That\'s not why I got it, although it does look pretty cool.  As for gaming, I really didn\'t notice much improvment in my skill but it REALLY does feel better in your hand.  The bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier.\n\nMy only negative comment towards it is how cheesy the driver and gui is for it as it looks "homemade".\n\nI would highly recommend this mouse for anyone who spends any time at all on a PC\n'
p1065
aS"\tRazor Diamondback it's not perfect but at 1600dpi who cares!\n\tI got the Razor Diamondback a few months back and have been very pleased with it's performance.  For gaming it's great, but I do not recommended it for everyday mousing around. \n\nThe resolution on the Diamondback was the selling point for me, and if that's something your interested in you will NOT be disappointed.  It's really super sensitive and has improved my accuracy quite a bit.  I do have a few gripes with it's design, but with 1600dpi that can be overlooked!  Oh, it looks cool when the lights are out the chameleon green paint is a trip.\n\nDesign problems that I have noticed... Buttons squeak, button placement is not optimal, it's kinda small for people with big hands, programmable buttons take to much force to operate which can cause erratic mouse movement. If you have a second mouse to do your work with this makes a great gaming specific mouse, highly recommended\n"

aS'\tGreat headphones, cheap construction.\n\tThe first week I had these, the left earpiece\'s plastic "rails" which hold the earpiece in its slot broke.  The parts that seem to need the most strength structurally are fasioned with cheap plastic.\n\nSound quality is great, with music playing and noise cancelling active, a normal conversation is barely audible in the background; great for crowded offices.  Battery life is good, I\'ve gotten 24+ hours using a NiMH rechargeable\n'

aS"\tVery impressive for the price\n\tI ordered these headphones from Amazon based primarily on user reviews of a number of noise cancelling headphones. I am quite pleased with my purchase. Though not stellar audiophile quality, the sound is pretty darn good, and with some minor EQ it's excellent. The noise cancelling effect seems to work very well: much better than I expected. Furthermore, the headphones are very comfortable and seem to be solidly constructed. I highly recommend them\n"

aS'\tGood Quality Sound for Portable Use\n\tThe quality of materials: zipper, hard case, strap and light\nweight are outstanding.

The player, radio... cannot be \nmore than 4" high, 2.5" wide and .75" thick; \nlarger and you may not be able to zip closed \nthe speaker case, which is necessary.\nMy items just do fit. So the Quality Sound \nand Materials make this a fine product, \nespecially for the money.\nOTHER PRODUCTS REVIEWS HAVE GREATLY HELPED ME \nDECIDE WHAT TO BUY, THIS IS WHY I DID THIS REVIEW. \nPLEASE DO THE SAME FOR OTHERS AS YOU BUY PRODUCTS.\n'

aS"\tPerfect Keyboard, Good Mouse\n\tI bought this package purely for the keyboard. I wanted a new one with wireless technology and I was driven to Bluetooth just because it is so reliable. I do not use the keyboard and mouse together, however.\n\nThe keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards I've ever used. I am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential. The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home, end, page up, page down, and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven't gotten used to but it's fine.\n\nI have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I've experienced no problems here, it's spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem, really, is it takes a while to register if you haven't use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however, there are no problems at all.\n\nI do not use the mouse with the keyboard. I decided to use it as a mouse with my iBook since it had built-in bluetooth. I had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly. I don't use the mouse very much, but the times I do use it I experience no problems.\n\nBoth the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice. I can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems.\n\nThe battery life on the keyboard is also very nice, esspecially since it has the built-in sleep feature. I have had to replace the batteries once since I got the unit in January of 06 (currently June of 06). I have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet, but I do not use it very much.\n\nOthers complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the BIOS or startup screens, but I haven't had any issues with that. It depends on how recent your motherboard is, and mine is relatively new so I had no problems.\n\nI highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse, or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop. Either way, you cannot go wrong with this package, it is extremely excellent\n"

aS'\tGood phone - short battery life\n\tOverall, a good phone. Low cost. Well built. Many features.  Speaker works OK for the price.  Features such as caller ID and the speaker phone are powered by batteries.  As stated by another reviewer a set of batteries only lasts a few months, even if you do not use the battery-powered speaker phone often.  This phone would be a great phone (for the price) if it did not use batteries, but was a plug-in model\n'

aS"\tGreat for the price\n\tBottom line up front:\n\nWorks very well, very low price, works much better with the \nincluded drivers than with the generic windows xp driver\n\nDetailed review:\n\nI bought this so I could use my new Treo 700w with my non-bluetooth-enabled laptop.  The price was my main motivation in buying it.\n\nInitially I just plugged it in and used the default windows xp drivers and it worked okay, however it didn't always work and i'd have to unplug/replug for my phone and the device to find and talk to each other.\n\nAfter getting tired of that, I decided to install the drivers that ship with the product.  I've had a much better experience since i did that.  I was afraid the software would be really clunky given the cheap price, but it's actually quite good and gives you a TON of options that the standard XP driver does not provide.\n\nIf you use a this with a laptop and you dock/undock it, you'll have much better luck if you stop the adapter prior to docking/undocking.  Otherwise, you'll probably end up having to unplug/replug it\n"

aS'\tLogitech MX500 optical mouse\n\tThis is a corded mouse; fits comfortably in your hand.  Moves smoothly across table surface; works well on a mousepad as well if you need wrist support.\n\nWorked out of the box (except for the application button) for the different buttons on the mouse.  The Internet buttons allow for a page forward/ back with your thumb.  There are also line up/down buttonw above and below the scroll wheel that allow for more control in scrolling.\n\nThe scroll wheel feel good, better than some other mice I have used.\n\nI opted to use the native Windows XP mouse driver, so the application button does not work, but the Windows taskbar is not much of a hardship :-); and I prefer not to clutter up my system with another set of marginal utility software\n'

aS'\tExcellent phone Tons of features\n\tI purchased this phone system as a gift. I set it up and used it extensively. The handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone. Many different ring tones to choose from, the antenna lights up when a call comes in. You can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you\'ll know when they\'re calling without picking up the handset.\n\nTalking caller ID is great too. No more rushing to find the phone only to discover it\'s a sales pitch or a call that could wait.\n\nI set this phone up on a voice over IP cable modem phone and the calls are loud and clear. \n\nThe phone is running next to an 802.11b/g wireless computer network and has NO interference at all. \n\nOne suggestion to make the batteries last longer: Do NOT leave the phone sitting in the charger all the time. This will basically be constantly charging the batteries and will wear them out MUCH faster. Instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays "recharge" on the screen. Then let it get a full charge. You\'ll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so\n'

aS"\tMusic Like Never Before\n\tI was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when I ran across these on a website. I was a little hesitant at first because I don't think I ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones. I finally decided to invest in these because I spend most of my free time listening to music. I received these the other day, and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don't let the breaking in period discourage you! After these become comfortable, you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time.\n\nI started with all my heavy bass tracks, and couldn't believe how they sounded with these headphones. I then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded. This is the first time in my life John Coltrane has given me goosebumps!\n\nIf you are debating on whether to spend this kind of money let me make it easy for you. If you are just a casual music listener, I would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones, you will save a lot of money. However if you are a passionate music lover and collector, these headphones will change your music completely. After getting comfortable with these, I would have paid much more than I actually did\n"

aS'\tFor extreme bassheads\n\tThis is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for "bassheads," featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don\'t think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\n\nOn the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I\'ve ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB\'s ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented "front and center," including techno bass (aka "car audio bass"), drum n\' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\n\nIt should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB\'s a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. \n\nIn terms of build, the EB\'s superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM\'s (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB\'s don\'t extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB\'s.\n\nOh, and some people think that the EB\'s look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB\'s stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.\n\nLike all of the UE IEM\'s in this series, the EB\'s are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM\'s, cord tangling.\n\nIt\'s unlikely that the EB\'s will prove satisfactory as your "everyday" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the EB\'s are well-designed and definitely fun\n'

aS"\tExcellent for Auto-Racing games\n\tThis is the 2nd Gamepad I've owned (My first PC was in 1993).  The 1st gamepad was the Gravis Gamepad (4-button + D-Pad).  I recently upraded and there is no GAME/MIDI port on the new system, plus I need more buttons for Need For Speed Most Wanted, etc.\n\nI love this controller.  I've had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results.  I've only used it in NFS games (I have them all).\n\nThe WiFi works flawlessly and I have a WiFi network in my house.  Installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins.\n\nThe rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software. This is totally understandable.  The feedback in NFS-MW is very slight but that's not the controllers fault, it's a matter of programming by EA Games.\n\nI like the weight of the controller.  It's not feather light, so with that motor and battery weight added, it feels more like a premium device (just like the 67$ with tax I paid for it - canadian dollars).  I didn't like how my gravis gamepad as so light, so this is a step up.\n\nThe analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel.  They are rubber gripped for non-slip action.  I am used to the D-Pad, so I have mine setup in NFS to use both as a directional control without having to press the MODE button to switch because you don't have time during a race to press a button before switching.\n\nIt works as well as my old gamepad, but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money.  If you in the USA, you'll be getting a much better deal.  It lists for 60$ cnd here but only 30$ US in the states.\n\nCONS:\n\nIt's not as comfortable to hold as I would like but its much better than my Gravis Gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI'm very satisfied overall and I knew I may have to get used to the way it feels when I hold this controller since changing from the old SNES style Gravis Gamepad.\n\n4/5 rating only because it could be easier to hold\n"

aS"\tBest phone I have used\n\tI work at a home office so I am on the phone lot.  I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion. In other words, I don't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don't use speaker phone features. Let's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn't care less about.\n\nThis phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and back-lit buttons all look very slick.\n\nThe screen is attractive. A big step up from back-lit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone.\n\nI like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute, adjust volume, and page through your caller history.\n\nThe belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around.\n\nI know many 5.8 GHz phones don't mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions (as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too). I don't know for sure if this phone falls into that category, but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing's for sure: this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee, static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.\n\nOne other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it's nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away, the best part is if you have a power failure. Your phone will keep truckin' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time.\n\nFinally, I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock. The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use, sitting it is dock, the phone's screen displays the time.\n\nSo far I've found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I've owned\n"

aS"\tThe Headphone to compare all others to.\n\tI have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of  and quot;over-the-head and quot; headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can't beat that price\n"

aS"\tA great audio compliment\n\tWith so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market, it was sort of struggle to decide.  Ultimately, I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand.  Plus, in my opinion, this is about the sleakest and best-looking unit out there (I went with black; I'm not an Apple-white drone).  The sound is very, very good for small to medium size spaces.  There are not a lot of features to the unit, which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.  Mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes.  Power cord is plenty long and I like the fact I can easily move the thing to a different room if I need music there\n"

aS'\tGreat quality, not-so-great price\n\tWell, the bose sounddock is a wonderful music dock.  Its VERY simple. just put your ipod on there and ROCK OUT TO THE BEAT. The bose quality is very obvious, and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it, which brings me to my next point. ITS TOO EXPENSIVE. my recomendation is to buy an FM transmitter and listend to your ipod on any Fm raido.  The only disadvantage of an Fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod, and its slightly easier(but thats what iPod is all about, isnt it...?)\n\nBasically, im saying buy it if you have a lot of mone\n'

aS'\tgreat little radio\n\tI\'m a jogger, and like to listen to All Things Considered while I run miles and miles. This radio is great because the light weight is unobtrusive. It has a convenient "lock" button to prevent accidentally changing the station with a bump. I previously had a similar size unit from Aiwa, this Sony has MUCH MUCH better reception\n'

aS'\tBeware Type-M\n\tThis card is the largest size that will allow clean video with FinePix cameras from 2004 or earlier.

aS"\tI didn't believe it, but it's true...\n\tI was devout in my belief that I could get similar photo output from my Canon S800 with less expensive paper.  I bought those big boxes of 100 sheets of Kodak's photo quality glossy from Costco.  My prints were blotchy.  Then I got my hands on some of Canon's Photo Paper Pro, and my pictures were magically crystal clear.  The difference is amazing.  I never would've thought paper would make this much difference.  I've since bought Canon's 15 sheet packs multiple times.  I now use the Kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who don't care much about the quality of the output, while I save the Canon Photo Paper Pro for prints we want to frame\n"

aS"\tgreat little speakers\n\tThose people giving these speakers low reviews because they don't have enough bass are idiots.  I don't know what people expect of these little speakers, but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do.  These are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels; from Paris to camping in Northern California.  I cannot imagine going everywhere without them.  They are not  equivalent to a $10k stereo system, but they are not meant to be.  All I need is my Zen touch or Zen micro and these speakers.  Do not listen to the other reviews, these speakers will make a decent stereo of your MP3 player.  Enjoy them anywhere\n"

aS'\tWorks Well Most of the Time\n\tI have used VoSKY Skype Call Center (USB07051C-01) for about a year now as my only home Skype In phone (paying $3.16 a month) after getting rid of Verizon (for which I was paying $50.00 a month).\n\nPROS\nIt works most of the time although sound quality is not as good as regular phone.\nEasy to set up.\n\nCONS\nOnce in a while the phone will keep on ringing even after you hang up and then you have to exit out of the Vosky software and start again.\nYou need a computer.\n\nIn summary good value for money and the best way to use Skype as your phone until phones that can be used without computer like Skype Wi-Fi phones Netgear and Belkin come down in cost and their bugs are worked out; or a phone adapter like this product comes out that plugs directly to the router\n'

aS"\tMakes using Skype that much easier\n\tAlthough I could go on and on about how Skype has changed my life forever, I will try to address the issue at hand, and that is the Polycom Communicator.  Basically I love the concept of the Polycom Communicator!  When I first started using Skype I used a USB headset that works great.  The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection, or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.  If I chose option a. envariably I would miss half the calls, if I chose option b. everyone would always comment that I sounded so desheveled when I tried to answer the call.  Well, now with the new Polycom communicator all I have to do is answer the call.\n\nAs far as the quality and performance of the Polycom communicator...that is the only reason I didn't give the item 4 stars.  It seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the Polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines.  It is really sporadic though, and I can't seem to reproduce it consistently.  Also, the driver for the Polycom Communicator has crashed on me a couple of times.\n\nSo despite the downfalls that I mentioned above, there is no way I could give up my Polycom Communicator now.  I simply love it, I just wish those other issues never happened\n"

aS'\tPerfect for your laptop\n\tI\'m a Creative fan so these are the first Logitech speakers I ever bought and I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive (and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no sub-woofer) I decided for this not-as-portable model.\nWell, these are perfect to keep on your desktop (though the ideal placement of any sub-woofer is on the floor close to a corner), as it has a small sized sub-woofer all controls in one the speakers.\n\nThese speakers sound really nice, slightly superior sound to Creative\'s corresponding model (SBS 350) but with less output power (Creative\'s SBS 350 sub-woofer is larger and more powerful)\n\nPros:\n\n- Headphone jack and POWER button in the left speaker\n- No "wired remote" (which adds more clutter to your desktop)\n- Nice design for the price\n- Even cheaper than Creative\'s SBS 350\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Small sub-woofer\n- No "wired remote" which means you have to keep one of the speakers close.\n- No bass control (which usually means too much bass if your audio source has no equalization control\n'

aS'\tFits Quest 2 perfectly..\n\tI have the Quest 2, but I\'ve heard that this also fits the Quest. I bought it because, while my Dell laptop backpack is well padded, I wanted to make sure that my Quest 2 GPS was protected "just in case". This case fits perfectly, literally like a glove. When I got it, I was sceptical; it looked to small, but I was wrong; the dimensions are perfect. And there is more than enough padding to protect the GPS from harm, yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket, which I sometimes have to (late day meetings where I leave my backpack at work). All in all, it\'s another great product from Garmin\n'

aS"\tThey withstand punishment year after year.\n\tI have been using these fans for the stalls in our horse barn for years. It keeps the flies away and cools down the whole barn. The barn is dusty and the fans collect a lot of dirt. I wash them down each year and they are like new. The fans I have now are on their third barn year. In a normal house I'm sure they would last forever. They are a little noisy, but the horses don't care\n"

aS'\tDoes the job\n\tI purchased this dashmount so I could swap the GPS between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount.  I don\'t know what the "feet" of the base is made of, but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket - it is heavy yet is very pliable.  This is useful since my dash (a 2004 F-250) has an uneven surface.  I can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it\'ll stay there.  Occasionally, on long or "bouncy" trips, it\'ll creep out of position a couple inches and I\'ll have to move it back.  I\'ve seen some comments complaining of that - but I don\'t see it as a problem since common sense says it won\'t stay perfectly still since it isn\'t bolted in place.  Overall this mount has worked very well.\n\nMy wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the GPS - I don\'t recommend she take the mount though - since the thing must way at least a couple pounds - too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion\n'

aS'\tDash Mount -- very helpful\n\tI got the dash mount because a friend recommended it.  I thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield.  I felt like I should remove it each time I parked somewhere.  Also, there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling. The dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to "mold" to fit the surface of the dash.  However, it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on.  That solved that problem.  Anyway, it is very easy to move it to the floorboard and cover it up when I stop, thus effectively hiding it from the temtation of a robber\n'

aS'\tThis is an awesome joystick!\n\tThis is my first HOTAS, but I did a good bit of research.  It is very easy to set up, and the SST Programming is very helpful setting the shift key.

aS'\tVery Nice Set...Almost too Nice...\n\tWe bought this drum set for our 2 year old who is obsessed with the concept of drumming  and  marching.  This is a first class set and as noted is almost too nice.  This is a huge step above the tupperware and pan lids our little guy used to use for his personal parades.  The drum is a bit heavy,large, cumbersonme for a two year old and of course is LOUD.  The cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality. Do recommend this purchase. It does come a bit steep at $30 but is a very nice looking and performing set.  If you little one gets hooked on drumming via the pots and pans, spoil him/her with this first-class set that they should be able to use well into their childhood\n'

The smaller-than-a-small-filet-mignon gps device talks via bluetooth to your 650, which attaches to your windshield via a well-engineered holster.  The charger charges 'em both, or not, as you see fit.  The instructions are clear and to the point.  The installation instructions are slightly out of date - you don't need a card reader to make it happen, after all - and the user experience is, in my case, outstanding.  If you've got a 650 and you ever drive somewhere unfamiliar, BUY IT\n"

aS'\tA Beautiful, Versatile Monitor!\n\tAfter having used CRTs roughly the size of small cars for my entire life, I finally jumped on the LCD-flatscreen bandwagon. This Acer 19" LCD makes me happy I did!\n\nMostly using my computer for gaming and movies the color, brightness, and size of the screen really matters to me. This monitor really nails all three of those areas. It provides vivid, crisp colors; it doesn\'t wash out the picture with super-brightness (what my old monitor did), nor is its display too dark to catch the action; and the 19" screen seems to have the perfect balance of immense screen size yet incredibly low desk size\n'

aS"\tExcellent paper, excellent price\n\tI bought this paper after my mom gave me a box of Epson 8.5x11 paper she didn't need.  I was really impressed by the quality of the pictures rendered on that paper by my printer.  When the paper ran out I looked for an economical replacement and found the price of most photo papers to be prohibitive - on the order of 40 cents per page.  Since you can only get 2 4x6 pics from a letter-sized sheet of paper, that comes to about 20 cents per print, not counting the cost of ink.  Finally I stumbled upon this paper - Epson S041727 - and the price per print was around 12 cents, which rivals the cheapest Internet photo printing services I've found.\n\nIf you print a lot of 4x6 pictures, this is a great value for a great product\n"

aS'\tWell Designed\n\tI bought this to illuminate the keyboard on my 12" Apple Powerbook when I work in the dark.  It works well, and shines impressively bright and wide.  I even use it to read by simply sitting it on its back on my lap as I read in bed and pointing the lamp at my book.  It\'s too bad the lamp\'s arm isn\'t telescopic or it\'d make for a perfectly good clip-on booklight right out of the box.\n\nThis device is well built, folds into a form that protects it from damage, even when thrown in a laptop case full of stuff that might crush something built less solidly.  And it has a nice retracting USB cable.  The retraction device for the cable, like most I\'ve seen on devices like this, can be a bit finnicky but with the right pulling technique works correctly about 90% of the time.\n\nUpdate, May, 2005.  The light died.  No idea why.  So, maybe it\'s not as good as I thought.  :\n'

aS"\tMy First MP3 Player~~Like it very much!\n\tLet's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me. \n\nI looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also.\n\nThe case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL\n"

aS'\tAwesome!\n\tI had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. \nI got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected! \nI really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. \nI also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. \nPeople are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips!\nI think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have!\n'

aS"\tIt does the job\n\tWell the most important thing about buying ink and toner for your printer is price, and Amazon.com has beaten every on-line price I have seen. As for the toner itself, Hewlett Packard toner is top. I buy this product for two  reasons, 1. It's what fits in my printer, and 2. I know when I buy the  C3906A, I am getting what I payed for, a quality cartrige that lasts. One  last note, twords the end of the cartrige life, a small line appears in the  content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one. simply  shake the cartrige, reorder, and by the time the new one arrives, the old  one is finished\n"

aS'\tWish I\'d bought this sooner!\n\tI\'m not much of a techie.  But, I do have lots of documents and pictures that I can\'t bear to lose should my computer decide to konk out one day.  \n\nI used to back up my most important files on CD: an overly complex and tedious process involving multiple CDs and lots of time.  But, with this 2GB flash drive backing up my important documents is just a matter of plugging the device in and selecting which files and folders to synchronize.  The files are copied over to the device quickly, and easily.\n\nThe 2 Gig storage capacity allows me to backup all of my most important photos and documents on one handy removeable drive.  \n \nScanDisk even includes a "Synch" software that simplifies the process of identifying and copying your important data.  (The software also helps you copy over your Outlook messages, folders, appointments, tasks, and other data that used to be difficult for me to find on my hard drive.)  \n\nAlso, I can imagine that the use of the Synch software with this little drive would made it very easy to keep the data on your work machine syched up with the data on your home machine.\n\nPhysically, the unit is small, sleek with a case that feels substantial.  The retractable connector functions smoothly and allows the case to protect the connector when not in use.  \n\nThis thing is great.  I only wish I\'d started using it sooner.\n'

aS"\tNot bad at all!\n\tI have some decent mics in my cabinet, as well as a nice preamp, A/D converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup.  I wasn't expecting as good or better quality than I can already get, but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have, but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin, but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high, and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to, but for $79, I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft N-Track Studio.  The ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating.  Way to go, Samson\n"

aS'\tBest of the bunch, and pretty good anyway\n\tThe 6500B was the last one I tried of three.  I\'ve had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again.  But the other choices had major drawbacks.  I really needed a two-line phone that wasn\'t 2.4Ghz.\n\nThe first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866.  It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too.  This phone uses phone company voice mail (no built-in ans mach) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter-tone so didn\'t know there were any new messages - arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. \n\nNext I tried the new Motorola MD7081.  I really wanted to like this phone. It\'s a 2-line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B.  I liked it\'s simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But, it\'s answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn\'t have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good.  But, if I got home, say, and listened to a message for my wife, the blinking stopped and no indication of "1 saved message" or anything.  So, I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We\'re so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it\'s not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an auto-line-selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non-busy outgoing line.  But, that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm.\n\nThe Panasonic, I am surprised to say, ended up being my favorite.  Hopefully it will be reliable.  I was always bothered by Panasonic\'s phones losing the date/time with any little power outage.  Happily, this phone sets its date/time from caller-id info even though the manual implies it wouldn\'t work quite that way.  With the right settings and phone company options (busy-forward), it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk.\n\nThe 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range.  It\'s much lighter than earlier caller-id handsets which I like.  I also like their shape of handset the best.  My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets - I would like 6 or 7.  Also, can\'t name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number\n'

aS"\tGood, simple, inexpensive plug-n-play mp3 player. Great for audiobooks and holding data!\n\tThis isn't my first mp3 player. I have a couple of the years and since my last one died I was looking for a quick, cheap replacement. I also needed a flash drive for work. Don't underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98. The sound quality is good, I can't tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to, but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use one-handed.\n\nAn unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks! If you turn off the player, it starts back up exactly where you left it, be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter! Its small without being too tiny, its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won't have a heart-attack. Its doesn't hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature, but if you need to carry more than an album or 2, or need extra features then you'll want more than this player anyway. \n\nThe best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3's and wma. It won't play AAC but if most of your music is this format you'll better off with an ipod.\n\nThis would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles. \n\nI'm giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what I need it to do without any hassle\n"

aS'\tHow many pictures will it store?\n\tHow many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  \n\nThe SanDisk SDSDB-128-A10 Secure Digital 128MB, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.\n\nI truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs\n'

aS'\tOn the Contract\n\tIf you buy this service plan, print out the contract (found at the top of this page) and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\n\nSome notes on the contract:\n1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, "You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You." I\'m uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will "replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer\'s warranty DO NOT APPLY." (Doesn\'t sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don\'t cover accidents and they don\'t cover "the elements or acts of God" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n\nSo, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN\'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don\'t hold me liable since I don\'t have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase "at our discretion" in the contract.\n\nAssuming they aren\'t jerks with their discretion and aren\'t too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn\'t get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n'

aS'\tConverts hiking to Auto usage\n\tI have had mine for a week. I had a non mapping garmin gps 12 for years, which was misplaced. I bought the navigation kit at the same time I ordered a 60 CS. It makes what I bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies. I had no problems loading software and maps, upload or download from/to my gps.\n\nI am impressed by the softwares ability to "recalculate" in navigation mode. If I ignore the suggested route, it continually adapts to suggest a new route based on where I am.\n\nI am sure that some portions of the database is not current as far as new roads etc. are concerned but I am impressed with the degree of information that is currently contained. I have gotten messages regarding keeping right for example (to avoid being caught in what becomes a left turn only lane), and knowledge of one-way streets etc.\n\nThe real test is yet to come to negotiate San Francisco\'s endless no left turns, one way streets, construction and limited freeway on ramps!!\n'

aS"\tA Good Wireless Mouse for a Notebook but consider the Bluetooth option V270.\n\tThe V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn't fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn't a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.\n"

So, I see it as a win/win product.  The only draw back is the weight and size. I just do not regret this purchase with the price an added bonus as wel\n'

aS'\tGreat way to hold and hear your 2G Nano\n\tFirst and foremost--I am not an audiophile, so I can\'t comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves.  They are fine for me and my listening habits--I find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine, although when I do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me.\n\nThat being said, what I wanted was a convenient way to carry my 2G Nano so I could listen and manipulate the controls with the iPod handy yet out of the way.  This lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and I would recommend it to anyone.\n\nSo why four stars?  Well, for a few reasons:\n\n--Only available in white.  I have a black 2G 8GB Nano.  I\'d have liked to match it.\n\n--No lock or release on the base that connects to the Nano.  While the connector does fit snug with the Nano and doesn\'t disconnect so easily from the Nano that I\'d fear it might fall off while walking about, I would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place.\n\nFor this reason I would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercise--but hanging loose around the neck really isn\'t the best place for the Nano then anyway.  The armband would be more appropriate.\n\n--NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano!  I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived, I could find nothing on the package that said "for 2G Nano", so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit!  Regardless, there should be a very clear "For 2G Nanos only!" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners\' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.\n\nAll in all, I am very happy with the lanyard.  It keeps the Nano handy while leaving my hands free, and that was what I was looking for\n'

aS'\tSonic Delight!  But... a Warning!\n\tThe Sennheiser HD600s have only one thing wrong with them: they\'ll change you from someone who enjoys good audio... into an audiophile! I\'ve been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top AV forums, but I\'ve always been satisfied with merely "decent" audio.  Until now.\n\nI\'d previously ripped all my CDs into the (previously quite impressive) Windows Media format at 192K bps, but that\'s now useless.  With the phenomenal ability of the Sennheiser HD600s to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music, listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline.  Here we go again... it\'s time to rip everything into lossless format.\n\nI cannot recommend these headphones more highly - they are simply extraordinary.  When your tastes become accustomed to this level of quality, though, life\'s going to get a lot more expensive, as you try to update everything to match your new level of sonic differentiation.\n\nStill, this is a bloody miracle.  My ears have finally been opened.  Wow\n'
p1182
aS"\tSennheiser HD-600\n\tHaving been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years, I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in, and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.\n\nEach time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600's, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP's. The difference in sound going 'lower' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. \n\nWhether you use Sennheiser's merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600's ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\n\nThe reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''Economy Class Beatles'' George Harrison's and Ringo Starr's albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600's reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600's are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to ''Take IT Away'' from 1982's Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \n\nIt gets much worse than 'Take It Away' on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.\n\nWhen you listen to your CD's, vinyl, DVD's in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you've spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney's JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600's, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. \n\nCan I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far, they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I'm trying to prove a point doesn't it.\n\nAlbums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD-600's. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70's and 80's when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs, that are all HD-600 friendly:\n\nIsao Tomita's The Firebird (1976)\nGeorge Harrison's eponymous album (1979)\nSteely Dan's Gaucho (1980)\nJoe Walsh's The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get (1973)\n10CC's The Original Soundtrack (1975)\nGodley  and  Creme's Consequences (1977)\nSupertramp's Crime of the Century (1974)\nXTC's Black Sea (1980)\nPeter Gabriel's 3rd album (1980)\nKate Bush's The Dreaming (1982)\nEarth Wind and Fire's All 'n' All (1977)\nLevel 42's The Pursuit of Accidents (1982)\nBilly Cobham's Spectrum (1972)\nFrank Zappa's One Size Fits All (1975)\nRingo Starr's Goodnight Vienna (1974)\n\nand a truly incredible sounding album from the 90's, Prince and The New Power Generation's ''Symbol'' album from 1992.\n\nAlbums NOT HD-600 friendly:\nTodd Rundgren's Hermit of Mink Hollow (1978)\nBlue Oyster Cult's Agents of Fortune (1976)\nPaul McCartney's Venus and Mars (1975 - and quite a few others)\nJohn Lennon's Imagine (1971 - and avoid 1970's Instant Karma like the plague, the piano track will hurt you . .  )\nYes's Fragile (often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping)\n\nand surprisingly enough, many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated CD reveal the errors of fixing something that ain't broken.  \n\n\nIf you have to save up for a pair, or do some heavy searching for HD-600's that are affordable, do so. In over 10 years I have never been disappointed by anything Sennheiser distributed, especially when I kept up with their pace.\n"

aS'\tNo MP3 support but very high quality device\n\tI was mislead with Amazon review which said it supports conversion to MP3 format with the software supplied, it does not. The help quite clearly states "You cannot convert a file into an MP3 file". It will convert to .wav then you can use a 3rd party program to go to MP3.\n\nIf it had MP3 support (at least conversion on the PC from the Sony proprietary format which is .msv) I would have given it 5 stars due to the good software supplied and the amazing sound quality possible. It you record in full quality mode (1.25 hours with built in 32meg memory) and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing. The Voice Up (so you hear each person in a conversation) works very well as do other nice features.\n\nBut it is let down with the software supplied not performing MP3 conversion. Going to .wav then .mp3 with another program is a pain and simply converting to .wav to get away from proprietary .msv takes up too much space.\n\nBut I would buy one again, as it is very easy to use, small, and very high quality. I just hope Sony would listen to consumers and support MP3\n'

aS'\tThis was just what I wanted\n\tBefore I bought this device, I was trying to enjoy the "Hearts of Space" website, "This American Life" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.

I did some research on the internet, read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.\n\nIt was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo, I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer, I simply unplug the USB.  It\'s very simple.\n\nI am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However, I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device, than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn\'t fancy), this does not cause diminished sound quality, so I\'m perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.\n\nIf you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo, check for two things.  First, your stereo has to have a set of two holes side-by-side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I\'m sorry I do not know the technical names for these things, but there\'s a picture of the red-and-white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer\'s "Product Description" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second, your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to "Auxiliary" input.  My stereo has this, but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside, be sure to check your player for these two things.\n\nOverall I am very satisfied and quite happy with the product\n'

aS"\tYou will need your own charger\n\tI bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works, it works beautifully. When it doesn't work, it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up, it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic, you have to swap the batteries. Do this and you will really like this mouse. \nAnother nice feature for this mouse is the range. You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way. The mouse makes a nice remote control\n"

aS"\tAlmost like prints from the photo shop\n\tThis is a great printer.  I have used it several times and it makes great pictures.  I had some pictures taken at a low resolution and the print still turned out looking great.  Tried this on a regular printer and the print didn't look near as great.  A great feature is proof sheet print of the pictures you have.  You can also add a border to your pictures which makes things nice for postcards.\n\nColors are great and vivid.  Also the prints look like that purchased from a photo shop.  I have not tried printing to non Epson paper so I can't say how prints would look.  I know that Epson printers look the best printed on Epson paper.\n"

aS'\tIt solved my problem\n\tAlthough the rear speakers need a power plug, this system solved my problem of being unable to run a signal wire to the back speakers from the front.

aS"\tExcellent Keyboard!\n\tI love this keyboard. \nAfter searching through just about every keyboard available, I was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price. I'm so glad that I chose this one.\nIt is excellent! The quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want. It's a great keyboard for gaming, office use, media or just ordinary, everyday use.\nThey keystrokes are effortless and near silent. The slide zoom feature is cool, but I don't use it much. It's better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though.\nI really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files, e-mail or web pages with immediate ease. The only thing I don't like about this keyboard is the sleep button. I NEVER use this and I can't see any way to reasign it. However, it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard.\nAside from all of that, how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price. And it was delivered the day after I ordered it.\nTo top it off, it feels sturdy and well made. I would reccomend this keyboard to anyone. It is a great all around keyboard with either USB or PS2 connectability\n"

aS"\tWow - buy one.\n\tI have been into MP3s since 1996 - I used winplay, and l3enc, and thought it was the most amazing thing ever.  I bought one of the first CD based MP3 players, and then a Nomad Jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk... next was the 10 gig model, and then I upgraded to the Nomad Zen 20gig with USB 2.0.  The Zen went with me everywhere - Africa, Europe, My living room.  \n\nAfter about 70,000 hours of use and abuse, it finally died.  \n\nI needed a replacement, so I looked at iPod, and Zune, but why would I stray from Creative Labs?  Besides, it's better in every way - better screen than the ipod, better interface than the Zune, and a better battery than either one.\n\nWhen I plugged it into my computer, I was blown away.  XP found the player, and without any drivers or proprietary (think iTunes) software, I was able to drop my non-DRM ;) mp3 files right onto the generous space available.  I was listening to my music in mere minutes without installing anything, or ever being forced to reboot my PC.  I transferred a couple of movies and I'm looking forward to my next flight\n"
p1195
aS"\tA little pricy, but it was worth it.\n\tThis is my first time ever buying a really expensive MP3 player.  I bought it three weeks ago.  If I hadn't seen the Creative Zen Vision:M, I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.  I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger, then I would've rated it a 5\n"

aS'\tA great Value\n\tBought this DVD player 4 days ago and have enjoyed it ever since.  It has many features and a good picture. You can\'t beat the large screen. I like the zoom feature especially. Another feature I like is that the battery fits flush with the dvd player in back so that you don\'t have a bulky protrusion when it\'s attached.The sound is not loud as others have said but I have yet to find a portable DVD player that has good sound.  You\'ll have to use external speakers or ear phones(included). Another thing I notice is that DVD-RW or DVD+/- R are not supported. They play but the menu system does not work. You have to access the file manually. That being said I cannot find this size dvd player anywhere else for less than $299.  The shipping was fast and free.  There is a stamp on the manual stating that the unit is sold "as-is" but the unit I got was brand new and not refurbished. So far so good.  I don\'t thonk you will be disappointed\n'

aS'\tQuality recorder is easy to use\n\tI bought this recorder to use as backup for real-time event video recording.  I have also used it concert settings.  The record quality is astounding, full range of dynamics, using both the stereo mini-plug input and the 1/4" inputs.  It is mostly being used now to plug into sound boards to record long event audio.  First thing I did was to upgrade to a 4GB Compactflash card.  The provided card is too limited.\n\nBattery life is adequate for hour plus recordings, and connection and downloading to PC is a breeze.  The WAV files are really high quality.\n\nIt all works as advertised.  The only minor glitch I have had, is that when you first try to start a recording, it gives a "media full" message, even tho the media is empty.  Then you select record again and it records just fine.  I went several iterations with Tech Support, who were very friendly and helpful, but the problem has not been resolved.  I also suspect the 3rd part flash card may be contributing to this glitch.  I would buy this recorder again\n'

aS"\tThis is great for just one system.\n\tI got this less robust remote because I only wanted to use it on one system. And I was able to set it up and program all the different buttons, and it all fits nicely in my hand. They have great customer support available on the weekends. The best part is everything goes on and off with one button! \n\nTHE DRAWBACKS: a couple of buttons you can't program or use for anything. And my goofey tv has 3 component modes and this thing is set up for 2, so getting it  to sink up right is tricky, and it's constantly getting out of sink.\n"

aS'\tThe little details\n\tOk, so I upgraded form a 30 inch LCD to a 50" Plasma screen, all the sales guys kept trying to get me to buy a power center.  I came home did some research and chose this one, if it didn\'t improve sound or picture at least i knew that the equipment was protected from power surges.  \n\nI hooked everything up last light and turns it one.  OMG!!!! amazing, my Yamaha receiver and Wharfdale Diamonds 8.2 no longer sounded muddy but insted bright and even toned, the kick from the sub was tight no sloppy and precise, it turned a good system into an eye opener.  The Sony progressive scan and LG plasma now are like looking at real people no a screen , the HD stiff is simply the best , digital cable it good and the dvd\'s are quite near HD.  All in all I would highly reccomend this to anyone.  \n\nThe blue light is quite bright but i placed a piece of blue painters tape over it and it is no longer a problem.  the voltage meter light is adjustable and not an issue. I now know the voltage in my home ranges between 123.5 to 121\n'

aS"\tGood quality, cool looking filter/protector for little more than a strip form-factor.\n\tNeeded better protection than my $10 surge protector for my HT setup now that I have a couple DVRs  and  a plasma.  Filtering would be a nice side benefit too.  Very little $$ more than the power-strip design units I was looking at ( and  now I see it dropped even lower!).\n\nPros: Build quality, fit  and  finish, plenty of outlets  and  diversity of outlets for me, nice form-factor compared to power-strip design, cool looking LEDs  and  meter.\n\nCons: Those cool looking LEDs cannot be dimmed  and  are too bright (esp the blue one!) if facing HT viewers.  I just blocked the LEDs w/a black card.  CABLE/SAT cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider (Cablevision)... Caused more artifacts on HD channels, so couldn't use the cable line filter.\n\nBottom line: Seems a great deal esp at the new even lower pricing @ Amazon\n"

I decided to buy one of my own after looked at several other makes and models all of which were more money. Plenty of connectivity along with base adapters to hold most Ipod models securely.

aS"\tInvent it! Iron-on transfers\n\tWhile thinking of ideas for my church's 75th anniversary celebration, I  decided to make T-shirts and sweatshirts using iron-on transfers and my ink  jet printer. I chose the  and quot;invent it! and quot; brand from Hammermill  papers because it was the most cost-effective (cheapest). I created the  design on my computer and tried it out on the transfer paper. The results  were outstanding for a do-it-yourself project. I followed the instructions  included with the transfers and it was a piece of cake. One thing that I  did find out - keep the transfers dry after they have been printed. One got  wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in  contact. This product also does a very good job in black and white, not  just in color. The shirts that I did, laundered according to the  instructions, came out of the wash lookin' good. I won't hesitate to use  this product again in the future. However, I am now having trouble buying  it locally, since my previous source no longer handles this product\n"

aS"\tAbsolutely Thrilled!\n\tWe purchased the YSP-1 in August as a companion to our Hitachi Ultravision wall-mounted television.  What a fabulous piece of audio equipment!\n\nWhen we began searching for a replacement for our Infiniti surround system, my husband and I had different concerns.  He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere).  When we found the YSP-1 we thought it was too good to be true.  One speaker instead of five?  Wall-mounted?  Doesn't take up any floor space?  We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves.  One had the YSP-1 set up in a room environment.  The other, on the salesroom floor.  In both set-ups it performed consistantly.  In both demonstrations however, my husband felt the low-end sound could use enhancement.  So, we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP-1 with our existing subwoofer.  Installation was fairly simple, provided you have the necessary tools.  The most important, and time-consuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television.  Now that it is installed and in use in our home, I feel the low-end sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the sub-woofer.  My husband though, prefers the earth-shaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound.  More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning.  Overall, we both got what we wanted.  Expert sound designation and sleek, minimalistic styling (with the added bonus of more floor and wall space).\n"

aS"\tperfect headphones for urban dwellers who use mass transit\n\tI chose these by reading other reviews on Amazon.  I am pleased with them and recommend them. Good sound, light weight.  The best feature is that they do NOT leak sound yet you can still hear loud noises around you.  This is perfect for an ipod-using NYC subway rider.   Don't want to annoy others by leaking sound, but you have to be able to hear if there is exterior noise, at least enough to know to turn down the sound and find out what's going on.\n\nOnly con - Once you lose or wear out the removable spongy pieces I'm not sure where you can get replacements\n"

aS"\tThe best option for the 'best' fit ......\n\tI tried all the rubber vinyl plugs that came with the E3C's, but they all had the shortcoming of not effectively sealing the ear canal making bass very poor, and they were uncomfortable.  The yellow foam plugs are easy to use and work just like the ear foams many people use in industrial applications.  They effectively seal the ear canal and are very comfortable.  Although they seem a bit expensive I've found that once they get dirty you can use water and a bit of dish detergent to clean them.  Just soak, squeeze, rinse and let them air dry and they are as good as new.  You can do this three or four times, then just toss them away.  \n\nHighly recommended\n"

aS'\tGreat System\n\tI previously had a 2.1 sound system for my computer, that were pretty good a few years ago when I bought them.  When I decided to replace them with these I was rather happy with my choice.  The sound is extremely clear and crisp, whether it be music or games, and I am very pleased with them.  The only downside to them is how many extra cords there are behind my desk, but you have to expect that with a 5.1 sound system\n'

aS'\tI think they are great\n\tThese are really great. Super noise cancelling. Affordable. They cover my ears completely without problem. At first, the headset was a bit tight, so I stretched the top headband upwards a little to relax or slightly loosen it. No more problem, while still having a snug fit. These headphones also fold up very compact, have two plug adapters and a nice durable sack for storage.\n\nIf you buy these, just make sure they fit well for your ears. If so, these are great; if not, try another type. Like all things that touch the body, it is best to try at a local store, before you buy it. \n\nThis is the lowest price I have seen for this product.\n'

aS"\tlife saver\n\tOn a recent trip, I was 23 hours in transit and couldn't have made it without this little device. It powered my movies and TV shows for at least 12 hours or so without a flicker. I was worried that the four AA batteries would make it heavy to carry but it didn't matter when the device was sitting on my tray table. Besides, it was comforting to know that AA batteries are ubiquitous throughout the world. By the way, I substituted the original batteries with Duracells on the advice of previous reviewers\n"
p1225
aS"\tGood\n\tI bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to Italy and I am very happy with it. I never had to change my batteries once and I listened to it all the time. Reading other people's reviews I threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great. The only complaint I have is the suction cups aren't that great. Several times my Ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun. \n\nOverall, I recommend this product. It is a little bulky, but if you're someone like me who cannot live without music, it's a great product to have if you aren't going to be able to charge your Ipod\n"
p1226
aS"\tPerforms just fine\n\tI have seen many reviews about problem with the volume control.  I experienced the same thing until I realized that I mistaken the up  and  down buttons with the +  and  - buttons.  The volume works just fine on my wife's old Sony receiver.  The remote is quite nice and it does everything the iPod control could do.  As stated in others' reviews, you can't read the screen from a distance, thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless.  However, it would be worse if the remote couldn't scroll through menus.\n\nIt is compatible with the latest video iPod.  I have the 60 gig iPod but I do notice a slight hiss coming out from the speakers.  I listen to classical music and the hiss bothers me.  I bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as I am in terms of sound quality.  Then again, I don't expect high fidelity quality from this small setup.  Since I have this little gadget for my wife, I bought the Squeezebox for myself from Slim Devices to stream music which sounds a lot better.\n\nIn summary, this dock does a good job and the design is not bad.  The construction is solid and I like the light on the remote.  If you are looking for great sound quality, I haven't encountered any dock that is better than this one, so this might be your best bet.  The Apple A/V cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and I see more value in this dock\n"

aS'\tawesome!!\n\tI\'m really happy with this purchase. I was worried that it would not work with Rhapsody (which is the media player I use the most), but it proved to work well with it. In fact, it works with all the media player I\'ve thrown at it, including Windows Media Player, MediaLife, RealPlayer, iTunes, Rhapsody, DivX Player, WinDVD, and PowerDVD. \n\nAll the buttons are functional (and I worship functionality - hence the 5 stars), although Firefox users have to deal with extra configuration steps to make the back and forward button work. No biggies, though, since setting up is really easy. Basically all you have to do is open the SetPoint software that was installed with the driver, point to the intended buttons that you want to program, and assign a corresponding keystroke to it. In this case, it\'s Alt+Right for forward button and Alt+Left for back button. Click "Apply" and you\'re good to go a-browsin\'!!\n\nBattery life so far is really good - it\'s been going on the same set of Duracell AA batteries since I got it 3 months ago, and still going strong. \n\nThe RF range is really good, although admittedly my room isn\'t big enough to really put its range to the test. Dorm-dweller users should be happy with the range, though. You could just lie on your bed and only lift one finger to control your music or movie.\n\nThis mouse is also great looking; not cheap-plasticky but actually sharp and slick. It does feel a bit odd to the grip when using as a remote control, but as a mouse it\'s really sturdy and ergonomic. \n\nI can\'t comment on installation since it\'s been a while since I first used it, but I guess no impression is good impression - if it was troublesome I\'m sure I\'d remember.\n\nI\'d second the other reviewer\'s gripe about how most cordless keyboards come with a mouse, and this fantastic mouse doesn\'t come with a cordless keyboard... But it\'s a great buy, all in all\n'

aS'\tApple 30" Cinema Display and PNY 6600GT\n\tI received it today, and it\'s a monster.  If you\'ve seen one in a store, it looks twice as big on your desk.  Until a few hours ago, I was running two 20" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT.  After doing online research about using the 30" display under Windows XP, I found that the "functional" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions, QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI, are going for $600+ on ebay, I was willing to give my old beater a try.  Besides, I didn\'t feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world, or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC (SB75G2).\n\nTo my great relief, the monitor worked on the card right away, even showing me the POST and Windows start-up screen (it did for the 20" displays, too).  But to my absolute delight, the card is actually running both the 30" and a 20" in 32-bit color.  The 20" looks absurdly small next to the 30", like I didn\'t water it enough or something.  The 30" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved!  Maybe I\'m just sitting too close.\n\nThe only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each other that I had to take the plastic housing off of the 20" plug to fit it below the 30".  I\'m not a gamer, so I can\'t say whether the card performs well for that.  It feels as zippy as with the 20" on regular windowing tasks.  I use Eclipse, Flash, Photoshop, etc., but no video editing or 3D stuff.\n\nThe screen had a slight warm cast that I didn\'t like.  Nvidia\'s control panel let me adjust it manually, and now my 30" and 20" look almost identical.  My biggest fear was of course dead pixels.  By the good grace of lucky ducks, this is the third panel I\'ve gotten from Apple with no dead pixels.  Brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges.  It\'s not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it.\n\nIn any case, I bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once, and it does a fine job at that.  I\'m using the 20" for browsing and, alas, a few panels that STILL don\'t fit.  Apple, where\'s 3840 x 2400??  I strip one star cuz it\'s crazy expensive.\n'

aS'\tGood for Madrid\n\tI ordered v8 as soon as it was advertised by Garmin but they shipped v7 instead.  Six weeks later I got the v8 update dvd.  My wife and kids had to make due with v7 while in Madrid.  She was pleased with the accuracy and said it enabled her to travel around with confidence.  However, she noted that Madrid was undergoing quite a bit of major road construction and she got stuck in multiple traffic jams on the major highways.  In the end, she would veer away from the major roads and let the unit re-calculate her route.\n'

aS"\tGood product within its limits\n\tIf you understand this product's limits before you buy it, you'll be happy.  It shows topographical contours, rivers and most streams for the entire United States.  In addition to that, it shows roads that were in existance 10-20 years ago.  These major roads are also named.\n\nThe limit is that newer roads don't show up.  It also doesn't support auto-routing, even if your GPS does.  Garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package isn't suited for it.\n\nThe product support could be better.  Neither the manual nor web site tell you how to load all 3 CDs on your computer so you don't have to swap CDs when transitioning between zones.  The company's web site doesn't give a good explanation of what the software can and can't do.\n\nYou'll be disappointed if your expectations aren't grounded in reality.  Garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available\n"

aS"\tMonster makes the difference!\n\tI just recently bought a Sony DVP-S560D model DVD player to replace my  older, more out of date player.

Then I purchased  S-Video cables from Monster Video and now the colors are more vibrant, the  picture is in higher-res, and I can see every little detail on the screen.  The picture quality that these S-Video cables produce are surpassed only by  component video cables, which cost many times more the price. If you are  considering buying these cables then just consider that for the price of  only one DVD, you can get better performance and picture quality\n"

aS"\tExcellent portable mouse\n\tI did a lot of research on Amazon.com before I finally decided on this mouse.  I wanted to replace my (extremely) small Kensington USB mouse with a retractable cable.  At home, I use a Wacom tablet.  Next month I am traveling abroad, so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington.  Wireless was key for portability.  I also wanted something rechargeable, and I didn't want the USB adapter sticking out.\n\nI received it today, and I'm on my first charge.  So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway).\n\n- I have large but skinny hands.  Mouse is small, but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers.  Of course convenience is not comparable to a full-size mouse, but if you want portability, this is about the right size.\n\n- I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4).  Excellent Bluetooth connection.  Also very good response, very little delay.  Only reservation is for the scroll wheel, which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling - this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands, because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position.  It is hard to explain, but not a big issue for me. \n\n- USB charger works well.  The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat, but becomes an otherwise full-sized mouse) - despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse.\n\n- As mentioned by others, installing the batteries is a challenge.  Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers.  Once I figured it out, not so hard. \n\nOverall, I don't seek perfection anyway, so this mouse does the job adequately for me.  I haven't tried any other Bluetooth mouse before, so I'm more or less in awe\n"

aS"\tSanDisk Is Reliable\n\tThis card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use.  \n\n512 MB is more than enough space for anyone with a 5 MB or less camera, assuming you transfer photos off your camera fairly regularly and are not shooting hundreds of photos at a time.  With the 1200x1600p setting I use on my camera most often, this card holds over 400 photos, and it will hold even more for those using a more email-friendly setting.  Do the math to figure out if 512 is the number for you, but I've had no problems with SanDisk products\n"

aS'\tVery easy to use and quick to acquire satellites\n\tI have to admit, I\'m a GPS junkie.  I\'ve had a variety of GPS units over the past decade and currently own 3 - the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving.\n\nI am greatly impressed with this unit.  It was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested, when a GPS unit is turned off and moved a significant distance, say 300+ miles, from where it last thought it was, it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the GPS satellites.  This can take a few minutes.) In any case, after the initial automatic recalibration, the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever I turned it on.\n\nThe user interface is very easy to use.  I\'ve used Hertz NeverLost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface.  I think Garmin\'s is better.\n\nOne highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for Points of Interest (POI), but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating.  This allows you to identify, say, hotels along your route while you are driving and then, using the telephone info provided by the unit, to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive - "let your fingers do the walking..."\n\nIf you don\'t tell the unit where to look, though, it can take quite a while to search for a Point of Interest.  I didn\'t know which city to specify and I did a search for "Eagle Rock Rec" (I was too lazy to spell out "Eagle Rock Recreation Center" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to.  I later realized that even though I didn\'t know the exact city the destination was in, I did know a city that was near the desired destination.  When I specified that information, the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.\n\nThe advanced user can also create your own POI lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340.  I have done this for all In-N-Out Burger and Krispy Kreme locations.  The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the built-in POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  If you are a Geocacher, you can do the same with geocaches, but you\'ll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.\n\nThe newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive, allowing signal acquisition indoors, but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine - especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately :-). I haven\'t tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet, so I might change my tune.  The comparable c5xx unit at this price point, the c530, lacks the c340\'s text-to-speech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).\n\nSince I already have a Garmin handheld GPS unit as well as Garmin\'s MapSource Topo mapping software, I used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my MapSource maps for the unit. I then loaded the topo maps for the entire Western US onto an SD card (between 300-500 MB) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen.  It worked!  So now I have the c340\'s excellent built-in maps and POIs for on-road trips *and* Topo Maps available to me for off-road adventures.\n\nOne thing you should do if you are in the US is enable the unit\'s WAAS capability (the default is for WAAS to be disabled).  Enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range.\n\nAlso, since this unit has a touch-screen, fingerprints on the screen are inevitable. You should *never* use an ammonia-based product (like most window cleaners) to clean electronic screens - it will cause them to fog.  Instead, use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes.  They are cheap and if you don\'t use them for cleaning your touch-screen they might come in handy for first-aid.\n\nI give this unit a highly positive rating.  I like it\n'

If you want to use netstumbler or pocketwarrior in windows or kismet and airsnort in linux, either go for the linksys wcf12 (prism based) or lucent orinoco based pcmcia card. if you're looking to run just 802.11b and check email, stream music, browse the web, etc, this card will be perfect plus it'll save you some battery power\n"

aS'\tA Top-Notch Universal DVD Player\n\tThere\'s no need to take anybody else\'s word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download, for free, the user\'s manual at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=DVPNS90V and LOC=3. I\'ve been running this Sony DVP-NS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now, and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One, for example, states that there is "no bass management," yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting "small" or "large" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user\'s manual), and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from -15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio, or you think SACD\'s are tops, is a matter of opinion, taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I, for one, prefer DVD-Audio, and I mention this for an important reason: Some product ads and the user\'s manual clearly warn that this unit "will NOT play DVD-Audio discs." Happy surprize: it most certainly will! For my DVD-A\'s that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks, the player simply ignores the primary DVD-A format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For "pure" DVD-A\'s (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks), it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above, the audio is full multi-channel surround, and not downmixed to 2-channel PCM, nor Prologic pseudo-surround. The only DVD-A function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVD-A\'s, and so displays only the "jacket image" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble-shooters that it\'s bound to please even the high-end audio-video geek-freaks. In short, you\'ll find this to be a superior universal player, provided you read the user\'s manual (all 84 pages of it!), follow it, and connect equally high-quality, compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features\n'

aS"\tGreat but quirky large-format linux printer\n\tI've had my Epson 1280 for over two years now and consider it money well spent. I run exclusively on Linux (currently Gentoo) and the Linux support for this printer (using CUPS) is superb. All modes, resolutions, etc. are supported. I use this printer a lot for engineering work printing B-size (tabloid) drawings and it works great for that.\n\nLike just about every review states, this printer slurps ink like Homer Simpson slurps beer. Because I don't print many color photos this is not a problem for me--if I was doing that I'd get the Niagara system other reviewers cite. I've researched the Niagara system and  it looks like a good deal for heavy users. \n\nMy main complaint with this printer--and the reason why it only gets four stars--is the ease with which the heads clog up. This printer wants to be used constantly. If you let it sit for a day or two it's almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you'll get streaks in the output. Then you have to either press the front-panel control or, in more extreme cases, run the head-unclogging utility (on Linux I use mtink) to force the printer to 'blow out' the plugged jets. When the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink. Do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into (a sponge-sandpaper-like thing) will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper. That's when you get out the Windex and paper towels and clean up the mess (google the web for details.) Because of this 'trait' I would not recommend this printer for casual users.\n\nStill, for B-sized printing and high-quality photos, and considering how well supported it is under Linux, there's not much else better out there\n"

aS"\tBig Work Horse, Colors Just Right\n\tHaving owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far, I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing, is a vey nice touch as well. However, it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings, one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer, having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen't have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it, the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I'm giving 5 stars on the Epson 128\n"

aS"\tQuality Cable\n\tI ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway.  Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore\n"

I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger, then I would've rated it a 5\n"

aS'\tDon\'t overlook this player\n\tEarlier this week I received the factory referbished Samsung HD841.  I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players, mainly my Philips 642, which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don\'t understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note, this model has the DVI output, If your TV has an HDMI port, you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First, this model has component, composite and S-video hook ups, as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also, this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great, at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again, The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV, but to be honest, it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player, at least on my tv which is a 23" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing, in fact, it does not have an index.  But, it the main thing is that the player is does perform well, and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it, not noted in the product discription, so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players, but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all, I will continue to explore this new player, but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane, the prices are good currently, quality has been good, and it is a Samsung.\nNote to the technosavy: I have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites, so I am using my DVI input for upconvert.  Also, the new Blue ray (HD 1080p) DVD players are out, so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this, you might want to wait and save till you can get the new DVD players.  \nNote 2: the factory referbished models come with a DVI cable, a 20-30 dollar value that many don\'t come with\n'

aS'\tQuality at a good price\n\tThis was one of the cheapest tv mounts and it had all the options the expensive ones had it will pull away from the wall as well as allow the screen to pivot up and down.It also compacts up close to the wall.\nI dont know what other features someone would want in a mount.\nIt is also very smooth when it moves and there is not any deflection or sloppiness in the construction, altough I only put a 14" lcd on it\n'
p1281
aS"\tI'd have given it 5 stars except for one irritating feature\n\tThere is a light that ALWAYS stays on and it is distracting, as others have noted. Otherwise, it is great. Good design, works well, no complaints. But that light...WHY did they design it with that?\n"
p1282
aS"\tVery pleased\n\tThis unit works very well and we are very pleased with it. Nice construction, good sound quality on both ends. We're concerned about battery life as in # of recharges before performance decreases, but no indication right now that is an issue. I would have give the product 5 stars if it had been cheaper. This class of device is overpriced in general. Amazon's price was very good, but overall still seems over priced. I would definately buy another from Amazon as these are 25% more at other places.\n"
p1283
aS"\tGood cables, but way overpriced.\n\tThis cable does improve the image quality but not by much. I was dissappointed to see very little difference between my standard PS2 stock cable and the moster cable I bought. This is not to say that the Monster cable is bad, but it just isn't worth the asking price. If you see on for under $20 then I recommend picking it up, but other than that, just avoid them because there isn't much better out there\n"

aS'\tWhat is this for?  High quality Audio and Video\n\tBREAKING NEWS: If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod, please look for the new iPod Universal dock, which has s-Video output for both photos and video.  It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa.\n\nIs this expensive?  The answer is probably yes.  This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500-$600), the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods.  However, for a couple of uses: high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hi-res TVs, it is a great alternative.\n\nThis dock basically serves three purposes:\n- The traditional synch  and  charge function available since the early days.\n- It helps you get "Line" output out of an iPod.  Line output is a cleaner, higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack.  It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater.\n- The super Video out for color iPods.  This function is something you cannot get without the dock.  So, if you like to show your pictures to your friends  and  family using a hi-res TV (Plasma, LCD or a Flat Screen) this is a great tool to use.  As an alternative, if you do not want to use s-Video and are OK with regular digital video out, a cheaper alternative is the "Apple iPod AV Cable" at $19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives.\n\nIn summary, buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi-res slide shows on your TV.  If you don\'t do it, it\'s just too expensive as a synch/charger, since anything you need is in the iPod box\n'

aS"\tWell built and roomy\n\tI bought this backpack for walking to work each day with my laptop and various other items I need to carry back and forth (umbrella, lunch, spare battery, paper, etc).  It's well designed and constructed and has fulfilled all my expectations.  Its size allows me to carry a hefty foldup umbrella which can lie horizontally.  I was concerned it size might make it intrusive or awkward, but it's not.\n\nMy only minor complaint is that the buckles on the shoulder straps slip gradually and need to be tightened every couple of days\n"

aS"\tGood Service!!!\n\tReceived it pretty quick, but it was SDSDQU-1024-E10M.  There isn't any difference just it comes from Europe instead of the U.S. That was pretty odd but otherwise it works\n"
p1289
aS"\tWorks for 10 days then quits\n\tMy experience, with several repetitions: The adapter, continuously plugged in, continuously on, works for about 10 days, then stops working and drops the connection. It won't restart. The only way to recover is to unplug it, plug in your spare (you do have a spare, of course), and let the Netgear WG111T cool off for a couple of days. Then you plug it in again, and it works for about 10 days...\n"

aS"\tNever leave home without it.\n\tI purchased my first Roadmate in August 2004.  Since then I have taken it to various places in North America.  It's gotten me out of some tight spaces.  I've never gotten lost while using it.\n\nI purchased the second one when the voice interface on the first failed.  I sent it in for repair.  (The extended warranty had just run out about 2 weeks earlier) The new RoadMate arrived in two days and has worked fine ever since.  The old Roadmate was returned to me repaired in about a week.\n\nI gave the first one to my wife and she has used it with success ever since.\n\nPros:  Easy to use. Amazing detail.\nCons:  Sometimes takes a long time to acquire satellites\n       Original mount is useless after about a month.  I got aftermarket\n       tripod for each unit and they seem to work fine. Software updates \n       are expensive.\n"

aS'\tIt\'s worth it.\n\tI have case logic CD wallets from 7+ years ago that are still in good shape...despite the abuse I put them through.  I bought this one only because of CD collection expansion. I find simply wiping off the outside cover with a wet sponge keeps it clean. The nylon covers really hold up over time. Remember- the "128 cd capacity" refers to CDs without their accompaning booklets. It\'s really 64 CDs with booklets.\n'

aS"\tThe Power of Charging\n\tThis charger is designed for every iPod EXCEPT the Shuffle.  The Shuffle connects via USB, this charger uses FireWire.\n\nEvery iPod charges while connected to a computer via FireWire or USB 2.0, but this charger allows you to charge your iPod in a wall outlet.  In addition to the charger you will need a connector cable.  You can use the one that came with your iPod or buy a second one.  Hook 'em up, plug it in the wall and get on with more important things while your iPod charges.\n\nFor international travelers, the plug pops off and you can purchase the correct plug for the country you will be visiting.  Great feature!\n\nI have an iPod Dock connected to my stereo and use an extra connection cable along with this plug to ensure that my iPod doesn't run of of juice durring parites and long playing sessions.  I highly recommend the Power Adapter to iPod users who want the flexability to use their iPod on the road or in conjunction with a stereo\n"

aS"\tGreat sound at affordable price\n\tI've been using SBL soundcards for about 3 years. I use it for recording live and with sound fonts.  This usb device is easy to set up and the sound quality is great!  One installation tip.  Initially after I connected it and installed the software, I was not getting any sound, although the software was installed successfully.  I rebooted, and everything was detected and has worked fine since.  So just remember to reboot after installation.\n"

aS"\tUnexpected Awesomeness\n\tI am a audiophile and am very picky when it comes to buying my toys. I bought these by accident when i was acually trying to buy the hd650's it was too late to cancell my order and since it was half the price i decided to try them out. I first hooked them up to my denon amp and listened to some cds and they sounded awesome. i could hear things in songs i have never heard before. I then hooked them up to my cheapy portable philips cd player just to see what it would sound like. to my surprise it sounded just as good as hooking them up to my denon amp. There was plenty of bass and highs and mids came out very good. the only draw back is that it is open and it bugs people that are sitting close to you. I am glad i got these instead of the 650's cause my friend owned the 650's and if you don't have a amp hooked up to it your out of luck\n"

aS"\tBrilliant!\n\tThis little doohickey is exactly what I needed to read my memory sticks.  Load the software, plug it into the USB port and you're off and running!  The MobileMate is SUPER SPEEDY!

aS"\tVery good value\n\tI'm very happy with this model. I use it mostly as a VCR replacement to record broadcast TV shows. You can't beat the price for this feature-set. I'll try to describe some aspects that aren't mentioned in the other reviews. The owner's manual can also be found online in PDF format.\n\nIt can schedule upto 16 programs. It does not support VCR+ or a TViO-style program guides. You can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus. It even sorts the main schedule listing and indicates which events are on the current disk. Every on-screen menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen.\n\nThe commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which isn't quite granular enough, but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well. The remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players. \n\nMy only complaint: The remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on right-hand side. When the unit is in our video cabinet, the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room. We can't shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and won't open if it's too close to the wall. Of course this probably means nothing to you.\n\nAt the highest quality setting (XP) it made a very good (near perfect I'd say) copy from a 8mm video camera using analog inputs. At that setting, only one hour of content fits on a DVD. The next lower setting (SP) which can hold two hours per disk, the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems. Most TV shows recorded in EP (8 hrs) are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times. This is especially pronounced on animated shows. The four-hour LP setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded TV. It also has a Flex-mode option I haven't tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality.  Probably would be good for recording a TV movie.\n\nIt's too bad other vendors haven't adopted the -RAM format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media, but it won't play on most other equipment. The other formats seem lame by comparison, but this unit can play and record on them. \n\nWatching one show while another is recording (or the same show that's recording, but from the beginning) is very easy to do. Most of the operations are very sensible and explained on-screen pretty well, but you should spend some time in the manual if you've never had a dvd recorder before. It can do a lot of stuff.\n\nOne interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using, the signal is sent through the s-video output.\n\nIt can't burn music CD's which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add. That and a battery backup (so I won't lose my schedule) and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star\n"

aS"\tMonster Connections\n\tI purchased the Monster Cable MP HTS 1000 without reading the reviews,(which I don't usually do) for the simple reason of where I purchased my hdtv, Samsung HLS-5687w they were trying to sell me but for a $150, which was too much.  I plugged in my equipment to the monster and at first there was no picture only sound.  I have directv and they have a connection which allows you to receive digital and analog signals through the same cable.  That connection needs to be placed after the monster in the connection loop.  After switching around the cables I had a picture again.  I can't really see an improvement in the picture quality (HD is beautiful) I bought the monster basically for the protection\n"

aS"\tHP 50G Review Comments\n\tThe 50G is the successor to the HP 49G. They both accept only a maximum of 1GB SecureDigital flash cards since they only have an approximate 1GB operating system file address space. Only about  0.9GB of the SecureDigital flash cards (a little more on the HP 49G than on the HP 50G) are accessible. The manuals only vaguely state that they recognice FAT16 and FAT32 SecureDigital flash cards. The HP 50G has a black case with a black metallic faceplate. The white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the HP 49G red (or tomato) and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate. The black HP 50G looks tastefully geared for serious users. They still have no display backlighting or a color display. The HP 50G keyboard feels a little more compliant than the HP 49G but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970's series of the HP hand held calculators\n"

aS'\tLinksys PAP2\n\tI am going to strictly comment on the Linksys PAP2. A lot of the reviews on here have been for the Vonage service. The Linksys PAP2 is NOT THE Vonage service, but one of many adapters you can use. \n\nI am extreamly satisfied with my Linksys PAP2. It is small, light weight, and perfect for those who need to travel. The voice quality is excellent and people say I do not sound like I am talking over VOIP. There is no line noise, static, popping, etc. \n\nI am giving this product 4 stars. Why? Because there is only ONE ethernet port. If you have a router, just connect the PAP2 to one of your available ethernet ports and you are good to go. If you do not have a router, consider getting another Vonage phone adapter with built in 4-port router. There are several.\n'
p1306
aS"\tVonage -- Wonderful Service\n\tI read the other reviews and don't understand where they are coming from UNLESS they are all by AT and T or BELL employees.  I've had Vonage for 3 years and have nothing but good things to say about it.  I have local numbers for Seattle, Salt Lake City, Boston and San Francisco so my friends can stay in touch. These numbers only cost me $4.99/each a month.  Customer service is excellent.  They stay right on the phone with you until everything works perfectly.  This is especially nice after they added 911 service\n"

aS"\tsimple physics\n\tI'm using Monster optical cable as well, but with different reasons behind. Anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from  magnetic field or EMF\n"
p1308
aS'\tAmazing clarity and bass\n\tSoundwise the Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1s were everything that they were supposed to be.  The bass is very powerful and can even be overpowering if not adjusted.  The sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection.  Setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case.\n\nSomething to note is the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is a little on the small size and thicker wires should be be purchased if you are picky about your sound.  The wires themselves are long enough and there shouldn\'t be any trouble reaching anywhere assuming you are putting these in a normal sized room.  One last thing to know is that there is no optical input for these speakers and only 1/8" plugs for hooking up the sound source.  If you want optical you\'re going to have to go elsewhere.\n\nPlease note that buying these speakers will not make up for having a mediocre sound card or poor music quality.  If you are using most types of on board sound or an ancient soundblaster card it is time to upgrade or else you are just throwing away your money.  Same goes for music quality, if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding, not the speakers.  If you can\'t spare the hard drive space for 192kbps its time to get a new hard drive.\n\nOverall these speakers are a great deal.  While the price tag does seem a bit steep it is well worth the money for anyone that is serious about their music or movies.  For those of you who like to game these speakers will treat you good, however in my past experience a good set of headphones is better than a full blown sound system.  Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast, don\'t bother spending the money.  These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality.  If you are more worried about loudness, do yourself a favor and buy some cheaper speakers, you won\'t even notice the difference\n'

aS'\tQuite a company for a college student\n\tThis backpack has been such a useful companion for me.  There are lots of space inside even for huge text books, and compartment is arranged just right to hold variety of stuff---CDs, DVDs, paperback books, pens, cell phones, water bottles, etc., etc.  There are numerous creative ways of storing stuff.  Indeed my whole life as a student can be inside at once.\n\nAs a notebook backpack, this would not provide the best protection.  Padding is fine, but depending on how much stuff you have a notebook inside could be squeezed a bit more than you desire.  Also, the clip to fix the cover flap onto the backpack almost is broken after a year of daily use for me.  I have had Dell 14" and 15" laptops with the backpack and fitting was just fine for securely hold it inside.  Wearing comfort is pretty good, and things are quite adjustable for your body.\n\nI would recommend this backpack if carrying more than a laptop, e.g., testbooks, is essential for you.\n\nP.S., I ended up using a warranty support to fix the buckle.  Targus\'s customer support is first rate---prompt, courteous, and reliable.  They actually replaced the backpack with a newer version of the same product.  Their service totally make them highly recommended\n'

aS"\tjust a little wobbly\n\tI had to 'fix' this ipod holder with a bicycle hand grip to stop it from shaking my ipod. I have a decent car and the roads are just ok but this thing shakes and shakes. I also put one of those beer coolers around the base of the foam hand grip and its now rock solid. Oh yeah and it holds the ipod just right too. I also put some of those velcro dots on the bottom for a little more security from my cup holder\n"

aS'\tLooks cool even with a white iPod.\n\tI hadn\'t seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod).\nThe holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It\'s very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them, but the standard one was enough for me.\n\nThe part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version, so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups.\n\nThe only "bad" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops), I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn\'t affect functionality so it doesn\'t make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn\'t hold iPods in their cases. So if you\'re like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok.\n\nI like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok, and this one is too if you\'re willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said, I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway.\nEdit: I bought it for $20, but now it\'s $15. One more good reason to get this one.\n\nI\'m not too sure, but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do, I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one. Maybe someone who gets their 5G iPod can confirm this, so don\'t buy this for your 5G iPod unless you\'re already sure or can try it before you buy it\n'

aS"\tBest FM Transmitter for iPod I've used\n\tI've used the iTrip by Belkin, the TunecastII by Belkin, and this Monster iCarPlay for getting my tunes to my car speakers.  This is the best design and works the best of the three.  I like that it can charge my iPod and that the transmitter itself is inline.  The signal seems to be decent enough, though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static.  This gets more pronounced the louder you make it.\n\nI think this is the safest for car use.  The iTrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the iPod.  So if you're taking a car trip (I live in NY but went to college in MI -- that's a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust, you really can't do it safely with the iTrip.  The Tunecast is a bit better, but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that I got for it didn't work).  Also, you can tune into any FM station with the up/down buttons, which is good, but you really only need the lower stations.  The iCarPlay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  Though I feel limited by the 8, I don't think going higher would help because there's more congestion.  I like the single button because there's no confusion whether you're going up or down and you can press the button, then easily tune the radio up a notch.  The other limitation I see is its iPod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the Tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can't use it without a car (or something else with that power source).  But considering I bought it to use in my car, it does what it should and does a decent job of it\n"

aS"\tiPod uses 30 GB hard drive; 2gb memory stick is flash memory\n\t2gb of flash memory will not be destroyed at high altitude or dropped short of shattering the memory stick.  A 30gb hard drive as in the iPod 30g (that my son has) is subject to air pressure, shock and temperature domain that a flash memory device will not be subject to.  Because the hard drive spins to lift the heads above the disk, moisture from condensation will cause the head to crash if, brought in from a cold car and turned on.  I do not know about the iPod but some larger devices have dew point detector that will not spin up unless the air in the device is at safe temp.\n\nTHAT's WHY..\n"

aS"\tBEST CABLE TO CONNECT YOUR DVD PLAYER !\n\tI purchased a Sony WEGA 27 inch tv. I took advantage of it's rear component input labeled video4.  I connected my Sony DVP360 Dvd player.  With dvd viewing, the movie Dinosaur, Bug's Life, Toy Story 1 and 2, and Vegas Vacation, the colors were very vibrant, details were dynamic, and the picture quality was very accurate in at least 480 lines of resolution. I have viewed these same movies on larger screen HDTV's such as the Pioneer Elite and was disappointed??? Glass picture tubes provide a more realistic picture. I can't imagine that I can do any better for my television than these cables.  I am completely happy with dvd movie watching on my Sony WEGA with these Monster component 3 cables\n"

aS"\tLinksys BEFCMU10 EtherFast Cable Modem\n\tThe product was easy to load onto my Windows based computer using Windows XP.  I connected everything as instructed and as soon as I plugged in the TV cable to the back of the modem, My internet explorer picked up the signal and put me at the log in page for new accounts of my cable provider.  \n\nThe modem comes with both a USB and 100T ethernet adapter port, so use whatever way works best for you.  I tried them both and they appear to work at the same speed.  I am guessing it all depends on the speeds your cable provide is delivering.\n\nAmazon had the best price on the product if you have the time to wait for their free shipping.  I ordered some stuff from them in the past and the free shipping seemed to take forever.\n\nYou may want to factor in paying the additional cost for shipping when buying this product if you need it right away. The price, even with the additional shipping charge is still a little less expensive than Best Buy.  The cost difference between buying it at a Best Buy store and Amazon online will not be much, and you'll have to wait a few days to have it in your hands, but you get to avoid the drive to the store.  I went this route, paid the extra shipping and waited for my package to arrive.  If time is not an issue, then use the free shipping method and you will discover that Amazons Price can't be beat, it is the lowest price anywhere.\n"

aS"\tGreat Cables\n\tI bought these for my dvd player.  They work wonderfully!  The old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but [didn't measure up}.  These monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies, especially the dialogue.  The old cables that I had made my movies sound a bit muffled.  But the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever.  For those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound, I would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or CDs\n"

The Verbatim discs seem to have fewer compatability problems than the other brands I've tried.  \n\nIf your home DVD player is not dual layer compatable, you may experience some problems.  It's normal for the movie to stop momentarily when it switches to the second layer.  For best results with movies, I burn these as slow as possible.  For data storage, they will burn at 8X no problem.  \n\nThese discs work as advertised.  If you're torn between Verbatim and another brand, I would opt for Verbatim discs.  They really do work the best\n"

aS'\tThe best USB drive out there\n\tThe SanDisk Cruzer TI is the most durable thumb drive on the market.  I had a 512MB Cruzer TI before this one.  I dropped it stepped on it and was just not too careful with it.  Through all that it never failed me.  I needed an upgrade and picked this one, because the 4GB was not available.  It move data fast and the new U3 stuff is very interesting.  I am not all that used to the U3 stuff yet, but I am sure I will start to use it to its fullest soon.

aS'\tMy last "jump drive"\n\tI had a small 512 Sandisk a while back, so when I saw a review for the Titanium 2GB Cruzer in a popular computer mag, I decided to upgrade from my Lexar 1GB.  So far, I\'m very impressed.  Just did a 1.26GB transfer that took 140 seconds.  I was a big leery of the included software, but was pleased to see that if I didn\'t care for it, it was easily removed.  I have not had an issue with either the software or the drive, and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract.  This is a very good drive, and contrary to the negative comments, I would encourage anyone looking for a fast, stylish, practical jump drive to seriously conside the Titanium Cruzer\n'

aS"\tBest $80 I ever spent on portable electronics\n\tI got one of these a few years ago.  It's been to several countries, on camping trips, bicycle trips, subways, etc etc and held together very well.  I pop this and the handspring into my pocket and off I go, not lugging around a huge laptop anymore.\n\nThe typing is comfortable, this is just like a laptop keyboard, and while I too have worried about the little popup part where you connect the handspring, it's taken a beating so far.  I'm buying another preemptively because I'll be so bummed when I do eventually manage to break the current one.\n\nThe hinge in the middle is annoying - you have to put the thing on a book or other flat surface to hold it in your lap.  I think that when the new one comes, I'll try to create some kind of deadbolt mechanism to hold the middle hinge when it's open and then it will be the single most perfect gadget ever\n"

aS"\tGreat all purpose remote\n\tI have long struggled to find the perfect remote.  The URC9910 isn't it, but its pretty good.  Its no match for my Harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls.  I have 2 URC9910s, both programmed identically for my main HT.  The cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house.  The kids can be using one URC9910 with the TV/HT and I can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the RF part of the second URC9910 remote.  For the price you can't beat it.  All buttons AFIK are progammable or mappable.  Setting it us is a pain and I had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my TV to do its thing so that is where it looses a star.  Otherwise its a great performer and with the price, I don't mind if my kids use it, whereas, they aren't allowed to use my Harmony 880.\n\nIf cost is no object, then there are better remotes.  For the price, I can't find one better\n"

Better yet, the cartridges are much cheaper than my Epson ones. Scanning is easy and good, too. I don\'t use fax, so can\'t rate that function.\n\nOverall, I am thrilled with this printer.

aS"\tCyber Acoustics Computer Speakers\n\tI got the newer model of these, with the blue light on the speakers . All I can say is that these speakers are worth the money. You get what you pay for. These speakers have pretty good highs in them, bass wise there decent. They hit alright, and sub decent. You pay more money, you get a better system you know. This system here isn't much money, so it isn't going to be the best. So there isn't no reason for the bad reviews. I think they work really good for the price their tagged at. So if your looking for a system with some good highs, and decent bass these are for you\n"

Mind you I had paid like $200 for Sear's sorry 3-5 year? warranty and it turned out they wouldn't have replaced it or probably fixed it even though my sister worked there.  I heard a sickening crash (like the picture tube/glass breaking).  It still works and only has a dent it the top left.  I think I got the remote a little wet years ago and it never worked again.  Not a big deal since I have a directv remote,but I forgot I even had PIP because of no remote.  From now on if I can afford it I will buy sony only.  I bought an xplode cd player 2 years ago with no problems except a dead remote that I never use\n"

aS"\tSony 36 and quot;\n\tThis TV weighs a ton, took three adult males to pick it up off of the floor and load it into an entertainment armoire. I have owned several Sony TVs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that I have had with a 27 and quot; Sony. Mainly compared this model with the corresponding Panasonic Tau, absolutely hated the Tau remote and am very familiar with the Sony. Note that the remote was not the deciding criteria, but it was a consideration. I have no real complaints about this TV, the menu system is nice and the picture very good. I do not normally use the built-in speakers so really can't comment about their sound. This TV has a 16:9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus, I tried it once using a DVD as source input and liked the widescreen format that the DVD player provides better than the 16:9 mode. The 27 and quot; Sony that I have has an auto-volume feature, this 36 and quot; does not and I do miss it. I would purchase this unit again. Note that there is a very similar Sony model that has upgraded sound, but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire\n"

aS'\tAn eyesaver\n\tThis monitor stand is worth every penny, and considering the price, that really isnt that many pennies.  What a monitor stand does is it raises the monitor to make it easier on your neck to view.  I have an IBM laptop and I place it on top of the stand.  With the stand, I probably have to look down at most about 10-15 degrees.  Before the stand, I would have to look down at about 35 degrees.  This does not seem like much, but if you spend alot of time staring at a computer screen, your neck will be sore.  Buy this stand and your neck will thank you.\n'

aS'\tLike a Glove\n\tThe case itself fits very snug around the IPOD, and even gives it a better look.  The only complaint that I have is that the plastic window that covers the dial pops open, and even falls off at times.  I still give the case a 4 star rating, because I am a soldier in Iraq, and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my IPOD clean.  If a product can keep something clean in Iraq, then I am guessing that it can keep things clean anywhere.\n'

aS'\tMy first review of a product!\n\tThese speakers were purchased for office use and occasionally for on the road.  They are a great look and compact.

I do recommend them.\n'

aS'\tHigh quality headset for internet telephone\n\tI purchased this headset for use with my Mac dG5 and Skype internet telephone.  The combination is killer.  I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only, but for me, the quality is far better than what I have with my phone, and it was really as easy as plug and play.  I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires; I wish that the headset was more sold.  On the otherhand, I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now.  And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller, which is important to me, especially as my hearing starts to deminish.  I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone.  IMO, this is too complementary.  For its price and features, a good buy and good sound quality, but IMO, this is not an audiophile headphone.\n'

aS'\tTuneBase Works Great\n\tAll 3 kids have a Tunebase.  It works great, easy to use.  It also charges the iPod while we travel\n'

aS'\tExcellent value\n\tI\'ve gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. They\'ve included Koss "The Plug," Sennheiser PX100, Koss UR29, Koss SportaPro and a few others. All had their strong and weak points. So far, this has been the closest I\'ve had to a good balance.\n\nFor my tastes (not necessarily anybody else\'s), strong bass is one of the most important things. The PX100 felt very weak in this area, despite what everybody else seemed to say -- weaker than my old Sony MDR-NC20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). I had problems keeping "The Plug" sealed in my ears, despite the "hold the outer ear while the Plug seats" advice. They\'re also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. The SportaPros had great bass, but leaked way too much sound. The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation, but were a little uncomfortable, warm, heavy and too bulky to use on the go. Going back a few years, I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass. Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD-420s.\n\nThe K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. The bass is among the strongest. When I listen to the 1812 Overture, the "cannon blasts" come through loud and clear, even at moderately low volumes, with no distortion at all. Isolation isn\'t as good as the UR29, but not too bad. Certainly a lot more portable, easy to stow in my bag at all times. The PX100s fold smaller, but they\'re a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume. Instead of 55-60% of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds, I now run at 35-40% comfortably. In terms of comfort, they\'re comfortable enough for hours of wearing, after a couple of slight modifications. If they press too hard on your hears, first extend the headband all the way, then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. After a few tries, it should be perfectly fitted to your head. Don\'t bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. Be patient. So it takes a couple of days of trial and error, but in the end, you get good-sounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. You\'d be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. You\'ll know if you\'ve unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. Here\'s an easy test: with a finger on each side, press the earcups harder onto your ears. If the bass doesn\'t get stronger as you press (the way it does with all open-air headphones), that\'s as good a seal as you need. I hated the little, square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. Other phones with similar headbands (like the Koss SportaPro/PortaPro) don\'t use these pads, so I don\'t think they\'re really necessary. Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband, and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads, especially after more than half an hour. In fact, without the pads, I barely feel the headband at all.\n\nOverall, I\'m satisified, especially at its low price point. I hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along. By the way, don\'t be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the US and Canada. Read the whole warranty sheet! A separate section on the sheet covers a limited warranty for these countries, so yes, it is covered\n'

aS'\tInexpensive, Great Performer, Outstanding Value\n\tI initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF-M37V because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It\'s audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session, I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59\'s tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).  For more on this model and others visit Xin Feng\'s website.  I highly recommend this model for cheap thrills!\n'

aS'\tNice radio\n\tA good basic AM/FM radio. Not digital tuning, but it works fine. Reasonably good reception\n'
p1376
aS"\tGreat picture quality\n\tI bought this item rather than the cheaper products advertised because I trust Toshiba and because the picture quality was better than average.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.  We have used it on several aiplane trips and my toddler is very entertained.  We haven't had any problems with the mechanics of the player.  We also bought a case (which I highly recommend) so that we have enough Baby Einstein to keep her happy to our destination.  Also, the battery has never run out, and charges quickly.  My only problem with it is that the volume doesn't go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner.  But, my daughter mostly looks at the pictures anyway, so it wasn't that big a deal for us.\n"

aS'\tFinally a cordless phone with good volume\n\tI do not have a hearing problem, but my previous cordless phones were inaudible even at high volume.. this phone fills the bill -- at least so far!  The only caveat: no speakerphone, which would be handy considering the amount of time most of us spend on hold.\n'
p1378
aS'\tLCD DVD\n\tThis car kit works very well. The screen is a bit larger than other DVD players of similar type. The only down side is that the battery only charges for about 2 hours (shorter than many movies). So, if you are going to use this in the car, you need to be able to charge it\n'
p1379
aS"\tA MUST for trip w/ small children\n\tWe bought this unit from Sam's Club right before a trip to Disney World. (8 hours in the car with a toddler--eek!)  However, it was/is perfect!  We still use it for trips around town when we're in massive traffic or our son is being really fussy.  The case that keeps the dvd player on the back of the seat needs a little work, but we figured out a way to make it work for us.  Also, the remote doesn't work well, but we don't really need to use it as a DVD usually lasts long enough between stops\n"

aS'\tNice little gadget!\n\tThese speakers are great for the common traveller and have great clean music. the only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it doesn;t fofill the height of volume I wished. It is pretty loud, but I like really loud. I do not own this but one of my friends does I hoe to get logi3 i station for my ippod it seems awsome according to the reviews\n'
p1382
aS'\tCheap and clever\n\tWhen we needed speaker systems for a batch of new workstations, price was the main consideration. The price for these units was well below budget.  Since our main application for them was for audio-enhanced CAT (Computer Assisted Training), High fidelity and volume were not issues.  They worked admirably for the purpose.\n\nThe use of a USB port for the power supply was a clever twist. One of my aggravating support woes is keeping speaker power adapters matched up with corresponding speakers.  I had been buying unpowered (unamplified) units with no manual volume control.  The USB trick gives me just what I want\n'

aS"\tCan't remember the last time I changed the batteries....\n\tI've purchased several Logitech mice(cordless optical)and I've been satisfied with all of them, except for the battery life.  I had to change the batteries in my previous mouse once a month.  This new Logitech mouse is terrific.  It's been several months and I have not had to change the batteries yet ... and I am not even using the on-off switch (I want to test the battery life without the switch first).  Battery issues aside, the mouse is smooth, light and accurate.  It was simple to install and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat\n"

aS"\tJabra BT150 Review\n\tI bought this headset and I must say it's a great buy. First off it's lightweight weighing in at about 16 grams. It's small which definately helps when your wearing it around. At times it's like you don't even feel liek your wearing anything. Exactly how a headset should be. I've place and recieved many calls with it already and having been using the the traditional wired headsets of the past this headset sound better and has no wires. The only problem I have found so far is that it takes some time getting used to the button placement and answering calls with the headset. Not to mention you only hear the standard ringtone rather than your custom ringtones. But that a small price to pay for such a great, inexpensive headset like this one\n"
p1386
aS'\tBetter than expected\n\tI was looking for comfy earphones to replace my Phillips one I got awhile back cos the rubber coating had fallen off and I stumbled on this one. I was a bit skeptical about the volume control thinking it would give out after a few times of sliding up and down but it works wonderfully and is so light and responsive to touch as well as being sturdy. \n\nI started out using the foam that came with it but that proved to be a bother and pretty much useless as the plastic earbuds are comfy enough. And they stay in your ears like glue. No more readjusting and I loved that.\n\nFor the price, this SO worth it.\n'

aS"\tNice Battery. Poor seller.\n\tLenmar Is great to work with, When Beach Audio will not do exchanges for faulty equipment. Beach Audio told me I would need to purchase another one then when they get the faulty one back they would refund my money for the second one that I had to purchase. POOR RETURN POLICY. So I just sent it to Lenmar under the warranty and they sent me a new one. Only took one week to get it. GO LENMAR.\nI've been able to watch on a 10in. Portable DVD Two (2hr) movies on just this battery with a little to time to spare. ***NICE BATTERY***\n"

aS"\tGreat surge protector, especially for transformers\n\tI really likethe design on this Protector, and bought 3.\n\nIt allows you to plug multiple transformers in, and still have room for regular plugs. Slipping plus in is a firm push, but not that tough. \n\nI also like the fact that it gives you a warning light if you get up around 12 amps.. Cool, but you have to keep in mind a 15 amp circuit shoulldn't have 12 amps to one plug..\n\nThe cord restraint system slides out to hold all the cords, then wedges backin to hold them in place. A bit hard to set up, and a zip tie could achieve the same thing, altough this is way easier if you change things\n"
p1389
aS'\tVery useful, but hard to get plugs in and out\n\tOverall, I like this surge protector and would buy it again. I bought it primarily because of the 11 outlets, six of which are spaced out to accommodate big brick-style transformer plugs. I did a lot of digging to find the surge protector that had the most outlets in this configuration, and this unit always came up.  It has worked just fine for the month or so I\'ve owned it. I particularly appreciate the angled plug, which allows you to use the second plug in a wall outlet without a problem.\n\nI only have two quibbles with the APC--the color and the stiffness caused by the plug-activated safety shutters.  Plugging and unplugging cords requires some force to overcome the safety shutters, which could be a problem if you are trying to get something plugged or unplugged while the unit is in an awkward position or hard-to-reach location.  On a much more minor note, the black unit and cord stand out quite a bit against light-colored walls and carpets, even when tucked behind a desk.\n\nI don\'t use the phone or coax plugs, so I don\'t know if my unit has the problem (or "feature") other reviewers have reported with Internet signal degradation\n'

aS"\tA good lapel mic\n\tI use this in my videography business, primarily for weddings.  So far I've never had a problem, and the mic has always given me a clear recording of voices from a lapel position.\n   I use it in conjunction with my iRiver-795, to record the sound directly, and it's worked like a dream... recommende\n"

aS"\tYou get what you pay for with these speakers.\n\tThese 2.0 speakers sound great (and not just for their size), are adjustable, small, and good looking. I'm about half deaf and every speakers with a separate woofer had too much bass when I turned the volume up so I could understand human speech. I'm happy I spent the money. These are real quality in my opinion\n"

aS"\tGreat headset\n\tI recently bought an altec lancing headset for $20 and it was the worst headset investment I've made. Horrible support for the ears and very uncomfortable to wear and they eventually broke within a week or two. So I bought this headset and I have been quite pleased with it. The mic output is extremely crisp. While talking with clients they said that it sounds like I'm talking on the telephone with them or better. They are very comfortable and rest on the top of your head unlike many headsets like my prior pair which have a support on the back of the neck which does nothing. All in all a good headset.\n"

aS"\tThe reviews are in...\n\tI've been using this CF card on my Nikon 4300 for a couple of months now.  It writes fast compared to my other CF (Canon stock, from another camera).  However, start up of the camera takes longer (because of the size), and as more pictures are stored, there is a noticeable degradation in speed in writing.  I've also used this on a Dell Axim, and it worked great!  No problem in formatting\n"

aS"\tGreat headphones for the money\n\tThere are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on-target relative to my experience with these headphones.  But here are my 2 cents:\nI got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDR-V2's had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don't do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).\nAs a last comment, I notice Amazon has these for about $65.  I paid $99 at a local store.  Buy from Amazon !  (no - I don't work for or invest in them ;-\n"
p1400
aS"\tGreat, uncolored sound\n\tI bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them, and I agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat, uncolored sound with tight, but not boomy, or overpowering bass. By the way, I've owned the Sony MDR-V600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these, but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications, but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion. These have been used by Musicians, studio engineers, and on air talent for 20 years now\n"
p1401
aS"\tGriffin iSqueez\n\tAlthough there are more expensive options, if you're just looking for something to keep your iPod from sliding all over in the car, the iSqueez is a great option.\n\nI use this with the Monster iCarPlay FM Transmitter/Charger, which uses the dock connector.  I can't get my iPod mini to fit all the way down in where it should because of this, but it still fits in there well enough to stay in place.\n\nI find that it holds the iPod at a great angle for viewing the screen from where you're sitting (though I'd recommend putting the passenger in charge of finding music)\n"

aS"\tGreat, except the skins\n\tI'm a section editor at a high school newspaper and I have used this drive every day both in that class and in all my others for over a year and it has never let me down. It's small, sleek and elegant and has a quick transfer rate.\n\nThe only issue is with the caps ans skins, which get annoyingly loose over time. I carry it around on a little pouch on my keys that I keep on my belt loop. When I pull it out of the pouch it will sometimes pull off the cap and skin. It's a minor annoyance for an otherwise great flash drive.\n\nI just went out and bought the 1GB version and I use them both\n"

aS"\tGreat sound quality and durability!\n\tI'm not entirely sure how other people are finding ways to damage their earphones, but I have used the same pair since the summer of 2000 (purchased from Amazon), and I have never had any difficulties besides losing the essential earpiece covers, which were easily replaced. When they are wound up in their little yellow case, the headphones' wires are well protected from stress unlike other models that don't offer such security.\n\nCompared to other headphones I have used, especially noise cancelling of both active and passive varieties, these phones have superior bass response, and all levels of sound seem reasonably clear.\n\nI have used these earphones with many different devices over five years: CD players, MP3 players (including iPods), Pocket PCs, desktops, and notebooks. They always sound great, EXCEPT - due to their greater sensitivity to sound, I often am able to detect the hiss caused by poorly designed audio hardware, which I otherwise wouldn't hear with over-ear phones. Pocket PCs especially seem prone to this, as their audio hardware is crammed so tightly in with noisy backlit screens and processors\n"
p1409
aS"\tExcellent unit\n\tUnit performs well, is reasonably fast, and has on-board security software that will allow the setting of a password.  If you choose this option, loading each time upon insertion is a little slower, and you must 'stop' the unit prior to removing it when operating under the password protection.  The few times I have forgotten I've not lost any data, but it scolds me for doing so upon the next use.\n"

aS"\tGood Buy\n\tI bought mine about a week ago and I haven't had any problems with it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it's a little hard to plug in  and  take out. But other then that I'm 100% pleased with it. It's not CD quality but it's very close. Good buy\n"
p1411
aS'\talot for the money\n\tThis review concerns the "v3" hardware and firmware v3.0_20 - I did not purchase from Amazon.\n\nFor the most part, everything works pretty well.  I have discovered a bug where the log is not cleared after a scheduled-email out, which leads to strange behavior for the log-emailing function.  I can always go into the web-interface to view or clear it with no problem.  Another thing to note regarding the log is that VPN (not pass-thru) has its own separate log area, which does not get emailed out.\n\nAs expected, Netgear support is mediocre.  Level 1 support can only handle very simple issues and Level 2 support is VERY slow.  I recommend you use the incident-submission area of the "My Netgear" website, so you can more easily track/respond to support incidents.\n\nFor those of you using the FR114p model, this is basically the same thing with 8-connection VPN service minus the printer port.\n\nI figure, after a few more firmware revisions, this will be a really good unit\n'

aS'\tIque Navigation kit\n\tThe navigation kit works well although you do need a mostly flat area to set it on. Our Toyota Highlander lacks enough room between the windsheild and the dash to set it up on top, but we placed it below the gear shift on the center console and it worked quite well. The Ique was able to hold signels with no problem. I think the suction base might be a better solution for cars with out a low flat dash area\n'

aS'\tGreat noise-canceling headphones.\n\tI have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year. I have been very happy with them, and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup. \n\nThe Good: They are not only noise-cancelling, but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear, blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source, in only dulls background noise, but I think that\'s the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio, nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noise-cancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace, put the buds in your ears, and use the power and volume controls on the noise-cancelling piece.\n\nThe Bad: Nothing is actually "bad" about them, but they\'re not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you\'re sweating, or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However, they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However, that doesn\'t make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping, it generally won\'t stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned, which detracts from the noise-cancelling effect. \n\nOther Thoughts: The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However, if the player is in a pants pocket, it could be a little close. Also, I often wear it when I\'m not using it, because you can forget it\'s there, and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk, and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up, I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring -- I began to get a slight buzz in one ear. However, I blame myself for that -- it was a mighty tug.\n\nI bought mine at Target, where they were labelled $24.99, on "clearance" from $49.99. A couple of months later they were back to $49.99. Once they dropped again to $34.99 (another "clearance" price), I bought a second pair as a backup. I\'m glad I did -- I\'m still using the second pair. Battery life is great. I don\'t know how many hours I get, but I can go at least a couple of weeks using my iPod for at least a couple of hours per day, listening to podcasts and audiobooks\n'

aS'\tNice Office Speakers\n\tAmazon has a nice price on the JBL Duet Speakers (July 2006 - 36.95) dealmac is a site I used and returned to amazon.\n\nI purchased these for my office desk where I wanted a crisp sound for low volume daily listening. Anything from Ambient, to Rock and Jazz. They produce sounds nicely, nice tight crisp. If these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers, as the 2-pieces alone do not produce any significant bass at all. Just the "hints" of bass in the music but no thud, if that\'s what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good.  These are perfect for offices and just daily music, sound is superb. Not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks. \n\nBuild quality is "ok". I got the white speakers and they are the nice "Mac" white plastic. The JBL logo on the speaker itself is awfully big. And the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky. One of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these (meant to not scratch your desk) did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on.  \n\nThe design is very modern and cool tho. They look nice on my desk.\n\nYou will need to keep these on for abit to let the speakers fully... break in. They sound awful right out of the box and after maybe one hour of keeping these on they will sound better.\n\nOn the low end of speakers out right now, these will probably sound the best and are most modern design, compared to the black boxes out there\n'

aS'\tSurprised what a difference this makes.  Much more pleasant working on laptop.\n\tI bought this laptop stand when I found out that my laptop could drive dual screens so I could have different items on the two screens and drag stuff between them.  So now I have the center of the screens at the same height, side-by-side.  It is really nice to have twice the screen real-estate.\n\nI figured that mostly I would put background stuff on the laptop screen (like email) and use my big hi-resolution screen for what I was activly working on.  But, now that the laptop screen is up at eye level, I tend to use it just as often as the big monitor!  It turns out that my dislike of the laptop screen had more to do with having to look down at it, even though I was not aware of that until I got it raised.\n'
p1421
aS"\tWorks great!\n\tOne of the least expensive ways out there to raise your computer screen to eye level. I am 6'3, so when I sit I am still pretty high in the air. With this stand I am able to sit with great posture and look straight ahead to my screen. I would definitely suggest getting one of these if you've ever thought about raising your monitor up off the desk\n"

aS'\tAll in all this is an excellent phone\n\tAs you may already know, this is an accessory handset which will only work if you have one of these Panasonic models: KX-TG2700/KX-TG2720, KX-TG2730/KX-TG2740. \n\nThe Panasonic KX-TGA271V, does not need (or use) a telephone jack. It simply plugs into any standard electrical socket and works off the base unit with one of the models mentioned above.\n\nThis phone was also very easy to register. (It had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered...) I simply had to press the "MUTE" button on my base unit and then press the "PLAY" button on the phone (the registration directions were even displayed on the LCD display on the phone!) Please know that I did find the Panasonic instaltion manual/registration directions to be a little confusing.\n\nSome features that are NOT mentioned in this description which ARE included are: finger grips/ergonomic sizing on the sides of the phone, the opportunity to play your answering machine messages off this phone (the base unit to the KX-TG2730 has a digital answering machine, and I suspect the other Panasonic models do as well) ---- THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY I PURCHASED THIS PHONE, YES THE KX-TGA271V WILL PLAY YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGES OFF THIS PHONE THROUGH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OF IT!!!, a separate "call waiting" dedicated button is also included.\n\nAlso, this phone will use any standard headset, it does NOT need a Panasonic branded headset. This was very important for me because I ofen use a headset and I do not want to purchase another one. I have since learned that ALL cordless phone headsets can be used on ANY type of cordless phone! \n\nPlease know that the batteries on this phone are not interchangeable with the KX-TG2730 system (that is the model that I have.) Also, the KX-TG2730 phone can\'t be charged in this charger, and vice versa. That is (likely) because the KX-TGA271V phone is slightly smaller and weighs less. \n\nThe face of the phone is white with a purple trim. The back of the phone is also purple on the bottom and white on the top half. The "white" in the phone is sort of a shiny metalic white, and the "purple" is not shiny at all. Some of the buttons are also slightly smaller than the buttons on the KX-TG2730 model. And the LCD screen is not flat, it is indented slightly, and bordered in silver. \n\nI purchased this phone from an Amazon.com merchant and am very pleased with it. I noticed that another Amazon.com merchant is selling the same phone that I purchased for less ($30.), however that merchant has HORRIFIC feedback and I was only too glad to pay a little extra for the confidence of knowing that I would receive a phone in a timely manner that would work! \n\nPanasonic makes very good phones. The only (big) problem is the battery life. The batteries often die after less than 90 minutes. I have solved this problem by purchasing a second set of batteries. However, this is still not a perfect solution. So, I had to purchase another set of cordless phones (Uniden.) I now keep two phones in each of the rooms that I had each of the Panasonic phones, and so far have not run in to any problems. I hope Panasonic will offer batteries with longer lives soon.\n\nAll in all this is an excellent phone. I hope the extra details that I provided will help a prospective buyer make the right decision. Amazon.com rarely provides specific details to these types of questions (does Amazon.com only employ braindead dimwits?) and the Panasonic Website does not offer this info\n'

aS'\tPerfect 17" Laptop case\n\tI recently bought an HP 17" widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling. This case is all that and more...on one side is a detachable cell phone case...the other side a HIDDEN drink holder. It has a pocket that it slides into if not needed- that came in handy in the airport.\n\nThis case looks extremely sturdy (well built!)and dirt just seems to wipe right off of it. It holds my 17" laptop, PDA, Cell phone, computer mouse, one-time-use cameras, Ipod, and all the wires and chargers for those electronics. I even fit two books, keys, a folder filled with directions and plane tickets, a notebook, and two dvd\'s in here. (all of that at the same time) Granted, all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport, so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form. The strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. The strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if I wanted, but it is not detachable (which means it isn\'t likely to fall off easily).\n\nThis bag is extremely well-designed. There is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage...it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats. Very well padded..I knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay! Of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding.\n\nBecause this bag does all that and more, it is large. It becomes larger the more you stuff it (obviously). However, I am 5\'1" and I carried it fine from North Carolina to New York. It looks great, if I needed to go to a meeting with my laptop I would gladly take it in this case. It looks professional enough.\n\nhappy buying!\nps. let me add that finding a decently priced case for a 17" laptop that has all the features this one does is nearly impossible. Also, in the stores I checked this was sold for about 30 dollars more than here on amazon!! If you have a smaller laptop, this case will work just fine too! It has an adjustable divider. You will just gain more room for other stuff. I look foward to long usage of this case.\n'

aS"\tThis is a one of a kind player. I love it.\n\tI've read the other reviews of this product and feel a need to defend this gadget. I've owned mine for about three years and I love it. I use it nightly. The application I find this perfect for is Audio Books stored on MP3. This of one of the only small, portable MP3 players that has it's own speakers. I go to bed listening to audio books and I don't want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around. However just slightly larger than a CD Walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip, where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines.\n\nThe big gripes I've seen repeated in the other reviews are:\n 1) Poor radio reception.\n 2) No Bass from the mini speakers.\n 3) Short Battery life.\n\n1) I never use this to listen to the radio, so I won't comment on it good or bad. But there are thousands of good and cheep radio's on the market so if you need a radio, go buy a radio.\n\n2) I'll agree with the poor bass reproduction in the speakers. Small cone's yield small bass. It's a physics thing. However when I travel and use this to play music in a hotel room, it's been good enough to satisfy the want of a little background music.\n\n3) Battery Life. I'm surprised by the times listed by other reviewers. I get about 30-35 hours of use when I'm on the road using the AA's. When at home or in a hotel, the AC adapter removes the concern about battery life completely. \n\nPerhaps this is because I primarily play MP3 disks which it spins up to read into it's buffer then spins down until it needs more data. \n\nAnyway I wanted to toss in my two cents, as this is a great gadget for audio book listeners, and I would hate to see someone miss out on it because some reviewers expected the performance of a boom box or home stereo out of a Walkman sized device.. It's my hope that we'll see more devices like this on the market and the price point to come down a bit. But bottom line, I've got my monies worth, and if anyone doesn't want theirs, I'd be glad to take it off their hands.\n"

aS'\tUnbelievably Durable\n\tI had bought one of these five years ago when I was in the States and am still happily using it at home. Unbelievably durable for a mouse pad heavily used for hours everyday for five full years. Fed up with giveaway mouse pads sliding with my hand movements, I was searching for something decent to use in the office and amazingly found the exact same item. It is a good example that how little things make a big difference\n'

aS'\tJust perfect\n\tI bought this Ipod 4G to replace my 2G one that got stolen and chose more memory as the 2G got filled up too quickly. Can say that this is probably the best size in terms of memory. Otherwise, as usual with Macs, very easy to use, even for low-tech people like myself, beautiful design, small and light, not too fragile, just great on the go\n'

aS'\tFlawed, but still the best case for the iPod 20 GB\n\tI researched cases upon receipt of my 20 GB iPod and deemed this the best.  This case consists of a thin plastic sleeve inside a separate clear, hard shell.  The hard case protects the iPod from scratches and minor falls while still allowing easy access to the controls and inputs.  It also does not obscure the screen.  An enclosed plastic belt clip attaches to the back of the unit.  \nThis case is not compatible with a Bose Sounddock as the user must remove the iPod from the case.  Also, Contour Design only enclosed one of the thin plastic sleeves.  I spent $5 at their website for 5 more sleeves and gave some to friends with the same case.  \nThe price seems high for a couple pieces of plastic but a case is essential and this is the best one for the 20 GB iPod.\n'

aS'\tWorks for me\n\tI\'ve had this controller for over a year now, and it still works great and reliably as ever.  After many months, the analog sticks occasionally drifted a little, but a quick jiggle and they\'d be back to center.  \n\nThe profiler software is excellent, allowing you to fully map the controller to your keyboard and even mouse.  This allows you to play any game with the controller, even ones which don\'t naturally support gamepads like Splinter Cell.  With the "shift" profile function, you can effectively double the number of buttons which I found great for playing a complicated flight sim like X-Wing Alliance, completely keyboard free, using only the gamepad.\n\nOnly downside: The D-pad is hard to control precisely.  It\'s difficult to press only Up, Down, Left or Right.  You almost always end up pressing a diagonal direction instead.  This made the D-pad more or less unusable for games like Street Fighter, but then the analog stick was a perfect alternative anyway\n'

aS'\tRazor-sharp image and good features\n\tFirst, I should say that I\'m surprised at how sharp and clear the image is.  The display card at CompUSA said this monitor has a 1000:1 contrast ratio, and I\'m not sure what that means, but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture.  The contrast ratio is higher than most other flat-panels I looked at, which have a contrast ratio of around 500:1 to 700:1 (including Samsung\'s own 20.1" non-widescreen model).  Everything is crystal-clear, which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies.  It is also good for gaming - Half-life 2 and Unreal Tournament 2004, for example, both look great.\n\nIts wide-screen resolution of 1680x1050 is more than decent for most tasks.  It also has a feature that lets you change the aspect ratio to 4:3 (which makes a square picture centered on the screen), so if you have any games or other applications that don\'t support widescreen modes, you can use 4:3 mode so that the picture doesn\'t look stretched and distorted.  Plus, the monitor has DVI, analog VGA, S-Video, and RCA inputs (which would allow you to plug in a DVD player if you want).  The monitor can also rotate 90 degrees, and it has built-in speakers and a headphone jack.\n\nBeing a flat-panel display, it is also lightweight and compact, which is ideal for areas where space is limited.  This is my first flat-panel display, and I was surprised at how lightweight it really is.\n\nAll of these features, especially the sharp image, make this a great monitor, and it is worth the money\n'

aS"\tA must have if you bought the car bracket\n\tThe den of horrors that is the Magellan car bracket requires you to have this power cord. If you don't then you will be fighting to change batteries and remount your GPS and that is no fun at all.\nI have used mine for over six months and it works without a hitch. A nice improvement would be a retractable cord facility so that you don't have excess cordage lying around your dashboard. Right now I loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again I never change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire getting caught up in the adjusting mechanism. Others may run into this problem. The alternative is a shorter wire but then it would make the power unit useless for some vehicles. A minor hitch but not earthshaking.\n"

aS"\tWorks out of the box\n\tPluged it in and good to go, I skipped the installation disk in fear of what nonsense is loaded on that... went to the admin screen, a little overwhelmed with ALL the features, it could be more stremlined, for a novice user they would be entirely lost, perhaps that is whats on the install disk (easier setup), but my experience self, got through just fine, enabled the maximum security features (more so then the easy setup button, which itself is good but does not suffice my network requirments).\n\nHeard lots of issues, was weary, but out of the box works great, no issues, no dropped connections. And for that reason, since it works I do NOT intend to flash the firmware to the latest, as the saying goes if it isnt boke don't fix it.\n\nBTW home network is a mix of print server, wired PC, wireless Apple powerbook, everything running smoothly\n"

aS'\tGreat Speaker System for the Price!\n\tI was surprised at the sound quality of this small speaker system.  I purchased it to use in my bedroom on my nightstand and am very pleased.

aS"\tAlmost perfect...if you don't mind lint\n\tThis case is a veritable dirt magnet.  It attracts more lint than I ever knew existed on my desk.  However, it protects very well.  One thing I was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen.  However, it doesn't even touch the ipod.  Also I worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel.  While it isn't quite as sensitive, it makes it more precise in my opinion, seeing as how I all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when I wanted in the S range without the case on.  This blue case even looks good on my black ipod, even though I was worried the color would appear muted.  It's still vibrant.  \n\nOne complaint that some have already brought up is the covered hold button.  Truthfully this doesn't bother me, because I have long enough fingernails to dig in and push the button.  But those without could have a great deal of difficulty.  Also, the hole for the headset isn't quite large enough, and sometimes my headphones will pop out (I'm not using the earbuds that came with the ipod, so I do not know how those would fare).  \n\nOverall, it's a great case that you won't lose your grip on.  It protects well, and you never have to take it off, even to plug it in.  I would recommend it, though it is a bit pricy.    \n\nIn a bit of an update, with this case on, my iPod survived a ferret attack, with only one little tiny puncture mark on the outside of the case.  I think this case is well worth the money.  My iPod could have been destroyed, but it's perfect\n"

aS'\tAbsolutely worth it\n\tPrinters have gotten inexpensive.  Let\'s face it; the game is, cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills.  I\'m fine with that.\n\nFor the $149 Amazon price, this machine actually *does* do everything I need it to:  a fax machine for those rare occasions I need to fax a physical piece of paper.  A great inkject that doesn\'t consumer *that* much ink.  It copies and scans.  I have used every function, am pleased with them all.\n\nSure, it feels a little flimsy; it is a small machine meant to do work that you are used to seeing a huge piece of hardware accommodate in a standard office.  However, it has held up well to some serious use in the past couple months, so that flimsiness isn\'t really even a complaint.  And I work from an office in my home three weeks out of each month, so I am more than glad I can reproduce all the functionality my "real" office provides me.\n\nAll in all, worth the money\n'

aS"\tDecent Phone - I'm Satisfied\n\tWe bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago.  One handset gave us problems from the start, but was promptly replaced when returned for service.  The system works fine in our 2-story, 2,300 sq. ft. home.  I did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house.  As a test I took the handset down the street about 100 yards away - it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street.  I like the features, including paging system, call transfer, and handset speakerphone.  Being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus.  I think the sound quality is very good, and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive.  I agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag.\nOverall I feel it works as advertised, and we'll be using it for a long time\n"

aS"\tGreat Phone\n\tI bought this phone over 6 months ago and absolutely love it!  It has great sound quality.  I love the features it has such as speakerphone, caller ID, and it's phone directory.  The only thing that is not great about this phone is that the base and the headset each have their own memory and you will need to enter people twice-into both directories.  Oher than that, this is a GREAT phone.  I have owned panasonic and GE cordless phones in the past and had problems.  I even bought and returned 2 phones before trying and keeping this phone.\n"

aS'\t4 games not T5 compatible. Others are fun...\n\tOn the plus side, it\'s a great value for the games that do work on the T5.  SimCity alone is probably worth the price.\n\nOn the down side, although Amazon claims it\'s compatible with the "Tungsten Series" that was probably written before the T5 came out.  Four of the games appear to act as "trial" versions, although it\'s impossible to enter the registration codes.  See (...) for an explanation.\n\nEven with only 4 working games past the trial period, it\'s a good  buy.  Just know you\'re not getting what\'s advertised if you have a T5\n'

The packaging didn't mention Nano so with a bit of trepidation I plugged it into the wall and my iPod and my Nano liked it!  Charging happened - it must have been made before the Nano came out.  As other reviewers have said, buy this one and avoid a HIGH price elsewhere\n"

aS"\tQuality Cable\n\tI ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway.  Originally, the DVI-D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal, but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVI-D cable, an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins, but with the advent of HDMI, nobody really makes them anymore\n"

Anyway I personally feel the only way it could be better was if there was a remote for it and it gets hella loud (considering its computer speakers) I don't even have to turn them all the way up to hear them when I'm in the shower so I am pretty much happy with them\n"

aS"\tGreat computer speakers for a Great price!\n\tI needed new computer speakers after my Cyber Acoustics died after only 3 months. SO i wasn't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast. I use a Mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers, but couldn't decide to go with either the Sound Sticks, Creatures, or these. Well since i am saving up for a new Laptop, i wanted to save as much money as possible. Plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they STILL work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance. Well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to Max and Sub base up to Max. (Yes i underestimated these speakers) When i turned a song in in iTunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair! I was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume, and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk! \n\nMoral one:  Do not underestimate speakers my good brands even with low wattage.\n\nI highley suggest these speakers for people who don't have much to spend or don't want to spend alot of money. If you want better quality i would go with Sound sticks or Creatures. But these look like they will serve me well\n"

aS"\tGreat multi-function with a little room for improvement\n\tThis is a great multi-function printer/scanner/copier/fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload.\n\nPrint quality is excellent, scanning quality is excellent, copying quality is excellent, faxing is faxing.\n\nThe control software is fine; not great, but it does the job.  The networking features, including built-in wireless, makes this printer a snap to integrate into your office / business using a wireless network.  \n\nSome concerns:  after heavy usage the top document feeder, used for scanning, faxing, or photocopying a stack of loose documents, begins to jam.  The rollers need to be cleaned to avoid this, and getting jammed paper out of the top document feeder is very difficult.   \n\nHowever, the fact that this piece of equipment even has a document feeder for this sort of functionality is pretty good.  \n\nThe fax log keeps a record of outgoing faxes and you can re-send them easily enough, but you can't re-print faxes received; the fax log merely logs their reception, but not the fax itself.\n\nOverall it's a good multi-function at a reasonable price with a lot of functionality built into it.  Would recommend to anyone who only has a light document load, with maybe the occasional large document scanning / copying requirement\n"

aS"\tWow!\n\tAs long as I own a pair of these headphones, I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again.  They sound PERFECT.  I cannot fathom a more balanced, natural sound.  These babies put you in the recording studio, or in the concert hall!  Bass is crisp, taut, and strong. You can feel it. Yet it is not overbearing or boomy. Midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist, and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy.\n\nThe only things to be aware of are the following:  First, you have to break them in.  They start sounding better after a few hours of use.  Second, they don't have an inline volume control, which I will dearly miss from my Koss KTXpro1s.  Finally, plenty of sound escapes.  So don't crank them too much in the library or at Grandma Edith's funeral.  \n\nOther than that, you have no excuse.  Put your iPod's lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong, and order these (or if you don't want to fork out $40, order the Koss KTX Pro titanium phones - which are almost as good as these, and definitely the best in the sub-$20 price range.)\n"

aS'\tGood sound, exellent noise insulation.\n\tGood sound for the price, and very durable. Discrete design. I prefer the "plug" design to other headphones. They don\'t fall out, and I can listen to music at low volume at home or in a plane, it makes almost no difference. Just be careful in the traffic ;-)\n\nThe  sound is good, especially for music where the bass is most important, but the treble is also good for pop and rock. The middle range is a bit dry for e.g. classical music, but still good enough for an mp3-player. \n\nI have two pairs.\n'

It can be slightly uncomfortable to put them in the first time, but you quickly get used to it, especially when sound is playing. In addition, the package includes three sets of differently sized earpieces including the default mid-sized piece shown.\n'

I plan to take it to an Apple store and try to get a replacement.\n\nJust a bit frustrating when you plopped down the $250 and the new toy already appears to be defective.

It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it. It loads from Itunes very easily and I have had no problems with it not playing certain files, (and I would reencode them if there was a problem.) Apple, don't let me down\n"

aS'\tClassic from the golden age of High-Fidelity Adiophilia\n\tThe KOSS Pro-4AA\'s were not made for iPod/MP3 headphone users.  TO begin with, they reveal the low fidelity of MP3 files (compared with LP\'s or CD\'s).  Also, they require a 1/4"-to-3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment.\n\nThese Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the "Watergate" hearings from 1973/1974, and notice that the Senators  and  attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones.  Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately, their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners, since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n1) Weight (about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary studio-reference headphones)\n2) Tight headband - as noted, the fit is fatiguing if your \'hat size\' is greater than 7 1/2.\n3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it\'s actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount).\n\nPOSITIVES:\n1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones, the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro-4AA\'s is almost impossible to beat.\n2) VALUE. As noted above, for the price you pay, these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced.\n3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years.  They were dropped and knocked around, and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone, fusing a coil.\n4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well.\n\nThe sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range. These sound great at low and high volumes.\n\nThe biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro-4AA\'s for audio mixing, other studio applications, and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen.  Size matters: they are heavy, and bulky so they\'re not easily concealed; and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs, these require additional hardware.  If you just want \'jogging/exercise music\', then these will not work well. If you want hi-fidelity at a bargain price, the Pro-4AA\'s are still the best choice around.\n'

aS"\tCool Mouse...with a minor gripe\n\tBought this mouse over 3 months ago, and its still going strong. The batteries last forever (I've never replaced them yet). My only problem is that at times, I will turn off the mouse by attaching the receiver to the bottom, but it won't seem to turn off! I reset the mouse and then attach the receiver again, and this always does the trick. Other than that, very ergonomic, extremely smooth and precise.\n\nI like the solid feel of a slightly weighty mouse, and with the batteries, this mouse feels just right. If only it weren't for the mouse not turning off sometimes, I'd give it a 5\n"

aS"\tAwesome wireless mouse\n\tI previously had purchased a different brand of wireless mouse, I can't\nrecall the brand, but it was awful (battery contacts wouldn't stay in contact\nand it was hard to use).  I was using my laptop at my brother's house and he\nlent me his Logitech V200.  It was AWESOME! Just plug in and use!\n\nI went home that nite and looked it up here and saw that others had had \nsimilar experiences, so I bought one.  I've had it for about a month now\nand love it.  The scroll wheel being able to lean left  and  right for sideways\nscrolling is a nifty feature.\n\nI recommend this product highly\n"

aS'\tCritical Al\n\tI have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well.\nIt lives up to its claims. The "face tracking" feature is not always fast and accurate, but generaly works (in good light).\nThis camera does require a significant amount of light to give good results, but then again what camera doesn\'t.\nImage quality is about as good as you will get from this type of device\n'

Later that day I found them on Amazon at almost 1/2 the price!\n\nAlso, when it comes to OEM inks, I discovered that they seem to last almost 3 times as long as the generic and refilled versions.\n'

aS"\tCobra GPS\n\tI have used GPS units from Cobra, Garmin, and Lowrance.  I consider this Cobra unit to be one of the best.  I started with the Cobra but it was stolen after a month.  Then I bought the Lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the Cobra. I returned the Lowrance and bought the Garmin 340.\n\nAdvantages of the Cobra is that it has a large screen and a solid mount (despite its size).  The interface isn't quite as intuitive as Garmin but once you learn it it is actually better.  The traffic service is also nice (costs more with the Garmin).  The Cobra is the most capable of the GPS units I mentioned but overall I am happier with the Garmin because of it's smaller size and lower price\n"
p1483
aS'\tCobra 4500\n\tThe unit operates as good as any other GPS system available, plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches.  I am very impressed with the GPS, but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed.  The unit falls off the window and from the dash, plus the power cord comes out too easily.  The unit deserves a five star rating, but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided.\n'

aS"\tGreat headphone for good price.\n\tI've owned this headphone for about a year now, and I've got to say, after going through multiple headphones, this beats all others I've tried. If this one ever broke (I doubt that'll happen anytime soon), I'll surely buy another one again!\n\nPros:\n\n- Comfortable to wear. The ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Even if you wear glasses, you won't feel uncomfortable.\n\n- Clear treble, middle, and bass. You can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly. Even with completely flat EQ setting, the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more). As with any headphones, take time to 'break it in' to have it function the best it can (it means, to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time non-stop, about 24 or 32 hours).\n\n- Sturdy wires. This headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studio-level headphones in this regard. The wire is very thick and long. Also, it's single wire format.\n\nCons:\n\n- Ear padding is perhaps, too soft. This means it won't fully cover your ear area, and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although, at first few weeks, the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out, look into getting in-ear canal type headphones instead.\n\n- As some others have pointed out, tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. So be cautious of your movements.\n\n- You might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. But this affects all closed headphones, so it's not a huge negative point.\n\n- The headphone is quite big and on a small head, you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head. The size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head.\n\nThat's all I've got to say, and overall, this headset is definitely worth your money\n"

aS"\tTakes a lickin and keeps on tickin\n\tI think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable.  Mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where I can get an open computer.  I have W2K at home with USB 1 and XP Pro at work with USB 2.  Never had any type of compatibility issue.  This 128 MB size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion.  I plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon.\n\nThe amazing this is that I have just removed my USB drive from a clean pair of pants that went through the wash and dry cycle.  And this was the second time.  I can't believe it still works.\n\nMaybe I'll have to start using that ridiculus cord and wear it around my neck.\n\nThrough away your zip and floppy disks and get one of these things.  Just make sure you back it up often\n"

aS"\tPeople complain too much\n\tHey, don't listen to those other schmucks. So maybe there are a few of these that are exceptable, but the rest just complain too much. I love this thing! I got it for Christmas, and now for $20, you can't beat that. I use a standard charger for it in my car, so I never have to worry about batteries. It seems that the best way to get it to sound the best, is work with your mp3 player or whatever your using (equalizer). I have also used it on my portable DVD player in the car and it sounds awesome! For the price, I highly recommend this product\n"

aS'\tSolid keyboard and mouse\n\tI\'ve used the keyboard/mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all I would wish. Of course, any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup, but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish.\n\nThe only drawback, and it is minor, is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK is on. I have to look over at the wireless receiver for this. Additionally, it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit. Yes, it would draw down batteries more quickly, but as an option it would be user selected.\n\nAll in all, a good wireless keyboard/mouse combination, and one I am quite glad I purchased.\n\nLife is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body. \nBut rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming,\n\n"WOW, Lord! What a ride!"\n'

aS"\tAbsolute necessity!\n\tI was unsure at first if this product would work with my iPod nano, but after checking out Griffin's website, I decided to go ahead and order it.  It works great!  I like to play Solitaire and read text files on my nano, so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if I didn't use the screen so much.  TuneJuice means I don't ever have to worry about that again.  I just keep a couple of 9V batteries with me, and I can keep listening, playing, reading or whatever on my nano as long as I want.  Love it.\n-------\nI posted the above review on May 22, 2006 after having had the TuneJuice for almost 3 weeks.  Two of those weeks were spent on vacation and this little gadget got a *lot* of use.  \n\nNow, about 5 months after first receiving the TuneJuice, I'm about to order my second one - to replace the first one.  I still love it, and did get a *lot* of use out of it, but snapping 9V batteries on and off so many times caused the wires leading from inside the battery compartment to the 'snaps' that connect to the battery itself to break off. Despite that, I feel like I got my money's worth and I'm buying another one\n"

aS'\tThis players meets all my needs\n\tI have been using my Sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures. I have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently.\n-use MTP music files because they use less file space.\n-adjust the file size on pictures to use less memory.\n-use the Speck toughskin case to protect display window (extra).\n-use the AC Sandisk USB charger instead of the computer USB port(extra).\nI do not use the raio or the video settings because of no interest, and the large amount of memory the video consummes.\nThis player does fine using the earphones or hooked up to a audio center.\n\nI think that the 2MG card will be on my list of upgrades.\n\nThe only upgrade I am made was to buy a better set of earphones. I did not like the pair supplied with the unit. My earphones have a volume control on the output cord which makes it much easier to control.\n\nI am not sorry about buying this item from Amazon.\n'
p1492
aS"\tIt's not perfect, but it's very good\n\tPros: Easy to use, last for days without charging (depending on the use, of course... but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging, and it lasted the trip), enough memory space, has radio, works as a recorder, small\nCons: Stopped working, froze twice since i bought it 3 month ago. When it's on, tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song, the player just skips and plays the next song on the list. \n\nBut overall i'm happy with my MP3. I'd recommend it\n"

aS'\tIt IS better!\n\tI didn\'t want to spend the money on this either, but it IS better.  I really don\'t know why, but it IS. No question about it.  PERFECT picture and sound!  I have a Yamaha RX-V2700 receiver which has HDMI hookups.  I tried a HDMI cable that came with my DirecTV box (from my Toshiba HD DVD player) and it was seriously lacking. This hookup is MUCH better!  I have a Monster Cable HDMI hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my Sony 46" flat panel as well (more $ but....).  I\'m finally satisfied.  I\'m watching (and listening to) "Batman Begins" (In True HD sound) on HD DVD and it is superb!!!!  This is just awesome!  The stuff of fantasy.  You only have to buy this/these cables once, so why not buy the BEST?!  I highly recommend this move.\n'

aS'\tBest remote I\'ve ever owned\n\tThis remote will do everything you need or want. Simple to use and great customer service. I had a couple of "glitches" (buttons that didn\'t work quite right) when I first programmed the device, but the Harmony support team helped me through those areas. The changes needed are now permanently in my data area on the Harmony web site so if I ever need to, all I have to do is reload the info.\n\nLike another reviewer, I also have a TiVO (2 actually) and the only button that wouldn\'t work on my Harmony 680 was the "clear" button. Customer service fixed that in a jiffy, too.\n\nI have owned several multiple device remotes over the years and never had one so good that I could really put away all my other remotes. I now only use one - the Harmony 680. Fantastic device! I\'d give it 6 stars if I could\n'

aS"\tVery high priced but works good.\n\tIt also seems like the product goes a long way and will last a long time. I've used it four times already on two different laptop screens and the first opened bottle (out of two that come with it) still looks almost full. If the price was a little more consumer friendly I'd give it five stars. I mean come on. When you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name 50-pack of CD-R's for less than $14, the profit margin on something like this is probably 200% or more\n"

aS'\tVery Helpful\n\tI found this keyboard to be very helpful.  I am a graduate student and spend a lot of my time typing papers.  While my laptop can be used to type, when you type for hours at a time it gets very uncomfortable.  This keyboard is a great size and has a nice feel for long days spent typing.  The bluetooth is also reliable and allows me to get some distance from the computer if I would like without stopping the connection.  I would suggest getting a mouse to accompany it.  Overall, a very useful and reliable product that makes my life much easier\n'

aS'\tWireless on the Desktop\n\tI just recently move from dial-up to DSL. Going DSL was not enough; I did not want to have cables running though the house so I started looking into going wireless. To make a long story short, after a little investigation I decided to make the leap into wireless technology. I purchased the WAP55AG router and the adapter cards, WMP55AG and WPC55AG.\n\nOnce the WAP55AG router was installed and set up, the installation of the WMP55AG PCI Adapter on each of the desktops were simple.\n\nI had no difficulty setting up the hardware and software and with a few hours, I was on the net through the router. One desktop is running XP professional and the other desktops are running XP Home edition. \n\nThe LinkSys Web site has all the documentation you need for installation and setup. There is a "Knowledge Base" page that covers a lot of the products and answers to a lot of questions about various products and configurations; I found it to be very helpful.\n\nPulled from LinkSys Web Site:\n----------------------------------------\nThe Linksys Dual-Band Wireless A+G PCI Adapter installs in most desktops and lets you put your computer almost anywhere in the building, without the cost and hassle of running network cables. Now you don\'t have to drill holes in your walls and climb through the attic or cellar to get connected to the network. Once you\'re connected, you can keep in touch with your e-mail; access the Internet, use instant messaging to chat with friends, and share files and other resources such as printers and network storage with other computers on the network. \n\nThe Dual-Band Wireless A+G PCI Adapter connects you with Wireless-A (802.11a) and Wireless-G (draft 802.11g) networks at an incredible 54Mbps! And for added versatility, it can also interoperate with all the 11Mbps Wireless-B (802.11b) products found in homes, businesses, and public wireless hotspots around the country. And whichever mode you choose, your wireless communications are protected by up to 152-bit encryption, so your data stays secure. \n\nFeatures of the product:\n--------------------------------\nOne adapter connects to either 2.4 GHz (802.11b or draft 802.11g) or 5 GHz (802.11a) networks\nAdvanced security features with up to 152-Bit WEP encryption\nDetailed monitoring and performance utility\nIEEE 802.11a, 802.11b and draft 802.11g compliant\n \nSystem Requirements (Minimum):\n---------------------------------------------\n200MHz of Faster Processor\n64MB RAM\nAvailable PCI Slot\nCD-ROM Drive\nWindows 98SE, Me, 2000 or X\n'

p1504
aS'\tGood product\n\tThese are very comfortable to wear, and the sound is great.  I use them out jogging, and they stay put, without any pressure on the ear.  The tight fit blocks out any outside noise, so be careful around traffic, as you cannot hear cars.  I would highly recommend these to anyone\n'
p1505
aS'\tGood Sound Quality, but...\n\tI bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable, not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B- good/not great\n'

aS"\tLogitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel\n\tThe Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel was purchased in Sept. 2006. I have had this for two months at the time this review is being written.\n\nI bought this to replace the corded version of the same item. The cordless works as well as the corded one. The trackball doesn't has quite as smooth a roll to it as the corded one did, but the difference is minimal. I wonder if this may be because it is new and the other one had had years of use.\n\nI find the shape of the Logitech Trackman to fit the hand very naturally. It is also much less strenuous on the wrist than a normal mouse, which is why I use it.\n\nI replaced the corded one so that we could easily move the mouse to different locations for use. This is for home use with multiple users, with different mouse location preferences. I took the corded one to use at work, where it still performs flawlessly 8+ hours a day.\n\nI also have a Logitech cordless keyboard.\n\nThere are two places where both these items could be improved:\n- Each one of these items needs it own receiver. It would save some of my limited home desk space if these could be combined into one unit.\n- I initially had the receivers out of sight behing an LCD monitor. I found that it was necessary to move them away from the monitor to get them to work reliably. This is a documented requirement in the owners manual, but that necessity takes away from the convenience of the wireless. The receivers, as stated earlier, take up space I would rather not spare\n"

aS'\tOn the Contract\n\tIf you buy this service plan, print out the contract and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\n\nSome notes on the contract:\n1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\n2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\n3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\n4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, "You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You." I\'m uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\n5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will "replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer\'s warranty DO NOT APPLY." (Doesn\'t sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\n6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don\'t cover accidents and they don\'t cover "the elements or acts of God" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\n\nSo, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN\'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don\'t hold me liable since I don\'t have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase "at our discretion" in the contract.\n\nAssuming they aren\'t jerks with their discretion and aren\'t too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn\'t get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\n'

aS"\tDoes Everything You'd Need In A Disaster\n\tI was hesitant to get this, since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception.  Now that I bought it, I'm very glad I have it.  It does all the things you might want in a disaster, inluding a flashlight, red flashing light (especially if your car breaks down at night), a siren (if you're trapped in a building), AC, battery, and crank power, and multiple radio bands.  While some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations, in a disaster, you only need a few stations, as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news.  Between the AM, FM, TV, and NOAA bands, my radio will received a huge number of stations--many more than would ever be needed in a disaster.  (I didn't try the cellphone charging function.)  It comes in a carrying case.\nOnly minor criticisms:  The case seems like an afterthought:  it doesn't hold the AC adapter; the knobs tend to turn the radio on when putting it in the case, and the knobs could get broken off if the case is hit (not that protective). However, it comes in a strong box which is perhaps better storage for everything.\nOverall, this is all you should need for light, siren, and broadcast information from multiple power sources in a disaster\n"

aS'\tGreat Value\n\tI just recieved my HDMI cable and am very impressed. The price is just what it should be about $5 and makes me wonder how somebody would spend over $100 for this cable at a store. The service was excellent and the cable arrived in 4 days! I highly recommend this cable. I just plugged it into my cable box and the other end into the TV and WOW what a great picture all around. The color is just so much more vivid using HDMI compared to component 3 wire connectors. Get this cable for your system and stay away from those high priced others\n'

aS'\tExpanded Memory for Motorola RAZR V3m for Verizon\n\tThe SanDisk 1GB Micro SD Card arrived quickly with intact sturdy packaging.  I installed it in my Motorala RAZR V3m as expanded memory for my music library.  Be sure to remove the RAZR battery to clear the access slot for the Micro SD.  The V3m recognized the expanded memory without any problems.  I used Motorola Phone Tools to transfer my entire music library.  The program converts the mp3 file formats before transfer. The entire music library...a full 1GB...transferred reasonably quickly.  The V3m is slow to access "My Music" using menu function #3 under "Get Tunes  and  Tones".  Function #6 "Manage Music" accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well.  The new corded Motorola SYN1301B stereo earbuds work well in this configuration.  Sound quality is surprisingly good, but the large diameter earbuds are flat...not tapered... and do not seat very well in the ear canal.  The SanDisk 1GB MicroSD Card provides great value at a very reasonable price for full optimization of the V3m as cell phone with "MP3" player\n'

aS"\tSaved me from a ticket!!\n\tOkay so it was about 8:45 at night. I was coming on to a 1/2 mile long bridge that goes over a lake where I live. I was doing 60mph, the speed limit is 40. As I start to approach the bridge I start getting a small K-Band warning. I instantly slow down to the speed limit. As I start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so I slow down even more to 35 mph. Then it gets to full K-Band. I look to my left where there is a service parking area, and in the pitch dark I see the reflectors of the one and only Crown Vic Police Car. As I pass the police car, I start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead.  \n\nIf I didn't have this detector he would have gotten me doing 20 over the limit.

aS"\tDriving worry free\n\tThis is my second Escort Passport 8500 X50. The first one is in another car. It saved me many times for getting caught though I'm not maniac driver. The detection range is very good, it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car. I love the blue color and it only costs $30 more than red. The only problem that I have experienced on my first one is sometimes I got laser false warning signals, especially on raining day with defog is on. I heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes X50 Pop and Laser false warning signals, and my first X50 is in my turbo charged car. I'm not sure if Pop alerts were false but since it won't help much, I have it turned off. Overall, it's very good detector, you will get payback if you own one.\n"

aS"\tMine works great\n\tI got mine to work in about 30 min following S Huffs directions below (followed exactly).  There was only one thing not mentioned that I had to do to get it to work.  Once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable WEP and put in the key and passphrase, I had to turn WEP back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender.  Basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5, this is what worked for me at any rate.\nI've had it for about 4 months now and it has worked as advertised.  I gave it 4 stars because set up was still kind of a pain.\n\nFrom S Huff: The tips that Anthony Taylor left helped me get it working... but I still had some issues. I've added onto his tips from his review below \n\n1-Disable WEP on your Router or AP \n2-Hold the auto-configuration button for 30 seconds(if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue) and unplug while still holding button. Plug back in after 10-15 secs. \n3-open your Internet explorer browser and type 192.168.1.240 (default ip of expander), a window will pop up. leave the user name blank and put admin as a password (this is default password). \n4-make sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your Router or AP,change password on the expander if desired  and  save settings. (all settings should be correct due to auto configuration) \n5-Enable WEP on the expander, once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or AP in step 6 -- aka same passphrase), save settings again. \n5.5 - As soon as you enable WEP on your expander - you will loose your connection to it as it's now setup for WEP and your router isn't - keep this in mind - drove me nuts. \n6-Go to your Router or Ap settings and enable WEP. \n7 - UNPLUG your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in -- Bang you're DONE. Enjoy\n"

I also like the feature of the intercom feature.  My daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she isn't on the phone, I can contact her to talk to her.  \n \nMy daughter also likes the mute feature where she can put somebody on hold if she is on the phone to ask me a question so that person on the other end doesn't hear her.\n\nThe phone has many other features but those are 2 usefule ones I like along with the caller ID\n"

aS'\tConference... in style\n\tI needed a simple solution for my office. I wanted to be able to use the phone, but not get tied down by the handset, or the headset. Here was my solution, Since the TS105B has the 2.5mm port for a headset, I purchased a Jabra A210 Bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office. So far... WOW!!! its worked out great. The phone is also good by itself, plus it was inexpensive through AMAZON. For anyone interested in going the route I took... you will not be disappointed. \n\nOh yes... you are limited to about 25 ft, or in my case as I work in a hospital where there are alot of other signals and lead lined walls... 15ft with max length at about 20 before you begin to hear static. \n\nThe phone was a great buy, as was the Jabra A210 adapter.\n'

aS'\tRainbow effect\n\tI have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing "Bourne Supremecy" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.\nAs far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon\'s price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product\n'

aS"\tCellphone Interference!\n\tThere is a little story before this:\n\nI bought a pair of Sony MDR-XD100's (they are full cup headphones) because I lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player (Sony HD5). I took them out of the package and found that, even at full volume on the player, it cannot drive the headphones sufficently. I went to a few electronics stores then found the KOSS EQ50.\n\nOn with the review:\n\nYes, there is a slight hiss, but I find it alright. The biggest gripe I have is that whenever someone within about 2-3 ft (IE, on a bus or subway) uses a cellphone, this devices picks it up. You can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers. I do most of my listening at home so this won't bo too much of an issue.\n\nIt also does a great job of amplifying the signal, it works very well, I can now listen to my XD100's properly (and they are very good!). I haven't used the EQ much but what I can say is that it is very, very sensitive. Raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference. At a half, my headphones start to distort.\n\nIf your looking for a nice little EQ and/or preamp this is the product for you. It has its drawbacks though, mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course, the hiss but it isn't too loud  and  I can live with it.\n\nI reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer\n"

aS"\tA bargain, if you trust customer applied ECO's\n\tI picked up 4 pairs of these on Amazon, and have applied the CA and Nylon tape fix to the first pair (took about 10 minutes to do, let it cure overnight).  Headphones look ok, with just the right amount of Geekhood proudly announced afterwards (reminiscent of the last generation of Geeks with the tape on the glasses).  Sound is very good (better than most earbuds), they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated Logitech transiever, and range is outstanding.  My only beef is how long I have to hold down the power switch to turn them on, and so far I have not successfully established a connections with my Treo 650.  1 star held back because of need of customer applied ECO, and they are only partially functional with the Nano (can't use the advance track feature of the headphones)\n"

aS'\tExcellent HDTV\n\tPurchase/Service:\n\nFor $2,200 at Amazon, this was a great purchase since it would have cost over $2,700 at a retail store (including tax and shipping).  Eagle arrived 10 days earlier than the Amazon estimate, unloaded the TV right to the TV stand, and after hooking it up and making sure the controls worked and the picture / sound worked, I signed for it.  And, Eagle asked if I wanted the packaging carted away.\n\nVery pleased with the service part so far.....\n\nMy Set-up:\n\nS6187 61" HDTV\nSony AV and 5.1 surround (this is not a digital unit.....I wasn\'t sure it would work but there are three options to hook-up a home theater: 1) Basic connection; 2) Optical; 3) HDMI)\nSony DVD\nMotorola HD-CATV box (We use Comcast)\nSony VCR\n\nExperience:\n\nAs far as the tv, the HD channels look sharp and clear, however the non HD channels aren\'t as sharp as my 36" Sony CRT TV (there are several settings on the Samsung for 16:9, 4:3 and wide format; setting to 4:3 or wide for non HD channels improves the picture quality a little).  But it doesn\'t effect the enjoyment since I purchased this for the HD, and it blows me away.\n\nThe TV controls are simple to use, and the on screen menu\'s are easy to navigate.  \n\nThe sound out of the TV is not adequate for surround sound, but I hooked up a 5.1 reciever and it makes HD come to life.\n\nI like the fact that you can connect components to an AV and/or the TV, so there is room for 3 additional components with my set-up.  \n\nI also hooked up my laptop (there is 2 connections for the video and audio on the back of the TV).  After changing the video settings on the Laptop (the mannual does a nice job for XP users), it was incredible!   \n\nThe camcorder hooks up to the side of the TV, so there is no need to move the unit away from the wall.  It was a simple set-up, and again, the picture quality just blew me away!!!\n\nI highly recommend this TV to anyome looking for a 50" plus TV\n'

aS"\tNot perfect, but the best iPod case I have found\n\tIt is remarkable that, even though there are hundreds of iPod cases in existence, none of them are near-perfect.  I tried four different cases, both hard plastic and silicone variants, and the iskin case comes the closest, protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use.\n\nThe case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone.  The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve, which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen.  In addition, there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case, and this provides the screen protection.  Due to the double-seam in the silicone, the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod, so you don't have to worry about it scratching.\n\nThe case even has a flap that covers the dock connector, preventing dust from entering, yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case.\n\nThe most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel, but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling.  Actually, I think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel.\n\nThe only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with it--I would not trust it at all, so I took it off.  It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use, and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well, but as I said above, I have yet to find a perfect ipod case.  Like most silicone cases, this one does also attract lint in your pockets, etc., but it is not as bad as other cases.\n\nUnfortunately, even though this is a great case, it is not readily available.  I couldn't find it in any store, and Amazon only sells it through Marketplace sellers.  I ordered from Applelinks, and they delivered it to me in four days.  Whatever you do, don't order from the iSkin company directly.  I have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases.  They should re-dedicate themselves to manufacturing these great iskins and let others worry about selling them\n"

aS"\tDecent GPS but now in DISCONTINUED status\n\tWe bought this about a month ago from Amazon.  The product itself seems fine - we used it on a vacation drive from NJ to Myrtle Beach and back.  At times, it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route).  However, you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it doesn't always recommend the best or shortest route.  Also, it was missing certain stores, restaurants, etc. that had been around for awhile.\n\nWe liked that it is a PDA though.  My husband drives limos so he wanted a mapping device for help but we hope to load some games into it.  This way, when he has to wait around, he will have something to do.  \n\nCONS: \n- You should be tech-savvy to get one of these set up\n- Match sure you get patches as unit will lock up\n- Manufacturer has DISCONTINUED this model.  They still offer some support but be warned that this is a DISCONTINUED model.\n- Since it became DISCONTINUED, it dropped in price about $60 two weeks after I bought it which annoys me somewhat\n- Will be spending extra to get bigger memory card\n- Came with EXPIRED Outlook coupon - why bother including this?\n\nPROS\n- Nice display and controls\n- Came with mount and dock (some don't - you have to buy extra)\n- We had no trouble with the suction cup mount (had to pry it off the window with a knife one time) but agree that most placement seems to block driver view through windshield\n- Also a PD\n"

aS"\tGreat Sound Quality - Smokin' Video\n\tNot much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture. You wouldn't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing. I have shown it to an I-Pod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the I-Pod.\nThe unit is not perfect, it does freeze occasionally, but the re-set function has always unlocked it. The video sometimes converts in a jerky fashion also. But the conversion software was able to handle very large files. I suspect a little tweaking might fix the conversions.\nSound quality is great. Combine this with Sennheiser CX300-B Earbuds and you'll love it.\nThis is my forth MP3 type player amd the extra money over the lower end players definately yields a better product. The previous player, Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3, quit working the week the warranty ran out.\nThumbs up on this one\n"

Also the 2 times I called Garmin with questions I was able to talk to someone who is in the USA as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some.

aS"\tOut of the box, this thing rocks!\n\tOk.. here's the deal.  I've been an avid Magellan user for the past 3 years.  I love my Magellan.  I've never liked the Garmins because of their clumsy interface (the buttons placed above the display NEVER made sense to me) and how the menu structure was built.  \n\nHowever.... We're planning a 2000 mile road trip from Utah up to the Oregon coast.  We needed something with expandable memory so we could upload more than one state map at a time.  My wife bought me the Magellan eXplorist 600 for Fathers Day.  I forced myself to use it for two days (and believe me, it was torture).  I could go on and on about why I sent it back.  \nWhat I ordered as a replacement was the GPSMap 60Cx.  Now keep in mind that I felt like someone who had turned to the dark side.  \nI couldn't be happier with my decision.  \n\nWhile I agree with most of the other reviews about the lack of base maps, and the expense of additional ones, this unit ROCKS!  It acquires satellites within seconds.  It has expandable memory.  It has a color screen.  It manages Geocaches.  It auto-routes.  It stores 1000 waypoints.  It has SiRF Technology.  It is a USB interface.  It has a belt clip.  It changes display contrast at night (automatically).  It slices...

When it's on, tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song, the player just skips and plays the next song on the list. \n\nBut overall i'm happy with my MP3.

I was ready to return the printer as I thought it was defective until I found out what the problems were.\n\n1) When the cartridges dry out, it will tell you that the cartridges are incompatible. This was confusing as I did have the correct cartridges in the printer. A "replace cartridge" message would have been less ambiguous.\n\n2) The printer has so far appeared "dead" once. When I went to turn it on, it would not do so. The solution is on HP\'s website - you must remove the rear door and do a hard reset. I did this and the printer worked fine again.\n\nThe printer does not come with a USB cable, but those can be easily bought for $14-20.\n'

aS'\tlike an electronic glove...\n\tI\'m a skeptic. No, I mean I\'m REALLY a skeptic... especially in today\'s marketplace (because nothing is built like it used to be). I don\'t buy anything without checking it out first, and even then, I expect that it\'s probably going to fail me when I do. Yeah, wonderful view there, huh?\n\nWell, needless to say, I was pleasantly (and quite happily) surprised when this device didn\'t fail me out of the box. I\'ve been using my speedpad for almost a year now, and I have to say that it has been by far more solid, responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be. I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now, that\'s how well this gamepad has worked for me.\n\nHere are the ins and outs:\n\n1) Solid construction. As others have stated, this device feels very solid and is just generally "sturdy as hell". This, alone, surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all!)... so I\'m glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department.\n\n2) Software. Do yourself a favor, when you get this device home, don\'t bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead, go directly to Belkin\'s website first-thing, download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what\'s on the CD, but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you\'ll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.\n\nI\'ve had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that\'s generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly, and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin\'s programmers on writing the software suite for this, they did a good job.\n\n4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product, basically, what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just "excercising" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad, and I\'ve never had it happen since. \n\n5) Other buttons. \n* The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance, and I don\'t use it much at all because it\'s hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). \n* The orange button above the d-pad also isn\'t that easy to press, though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage, it\'s not impossible to press this button (in fact, I use it as my default "map" button in most of the games I play). It\'s perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.\n* I haven\'t experienced any problems hitting the \'space\' button below the d-pad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can\'t simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key, I have to actually lift my thumb off the d-pad to do it - and that\'s not much of a complaint at all, really.\n\nThe d-pad itself is a godsend! I\'m a true console gamer, having used nothing but d-pads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). D-pad is all I know, really. In fact, the one thing that\'s kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I\'ve never, ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual d-pad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. \n\nAs I said at the top of this review, I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven\'t and that I really needed - a controller interface that\'s actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I\'m using it most of the time, allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I\'m playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place, isn\'t it? \n\nThe Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend it to anyone who\'s looking for the type of benefits I\'ve listed. And, for that matter, I\'m recommending it right now in fact...\n'

aS'\tSony earbuds are great\n\tThe sound of these earbuds are great..and they are a value for the price.\n\nHowever the "in the ear" design causes them to catch sweat, and they won\'t last when you sweat into them alot. After 9-12 months of wearing them in the GYM they will stop working. I have gone through 3 pairs in the last 2 years\n'

aS"\tSTABLE, FAST, and QUIET\n\tI work in a computer lab where we constantly re-image devices (using Norton Ghost).  I have 3 laptops and 1 DELL GX620 desktop and all of them have Gigabit connection.  When I connected those 4 to this switch and run the imaging process simultaneous, I get the same performance (0 differences) as I run 1 laptop to the GX620.  This testing was done with Cat5 cables that I pick randomly from my lab.  I can't wait to add more devices and using Cat6 cables to get my work done faster\n"

aS"\tAntenna works OK, Garmin needs a better antenna plug\n\tThe antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the GPS units internal antenna. This easily solved the issue of poor reception when the GPS is inside of a car; however, the best accuracy I am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs. the 9 feet using the GPS's internal antenna when in an open area.  Garmin's external antenna connector plug does not attach very firmly and can disconnect easily when the units are moved around (on my GPS).  I feel the antenna was worth purchasing\n"

aS'\tMagnetic or Suction Mount Antenna\n\tI use the Suctions Mount Antenna because I remove from sight whenever I leave my car which is idea for my purposes.  The antenna does greatly improve the reception and maintain a satilite lock.  The only draw back is keeping it attached to windshield in cold weather untill the car warms up\n'

aS'\tfine, but not what i expected...\n\tthis unit has a/v in.  my thought was that one could play video games on it, or view images from a camcorder/digital camera.  however, all video sent to it gets distorted to fit the wide screen.  so it does not allow me to do all i wanted.  it is also a bit on the loud side.  if your getting this for the car i suggest the coby 7050 unit.  i got one of those also, and it works much better for the kids being a tablet form factor. it also does not make much noise\n'

aS"\tGood companion with D-Link Router DI-704\n\tThis is a great swicth with low price.  I use it together with D-Link DI-704 4-port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 PC, two servers, one PowerMac and a laptop connected to cable modem ISP. Connecting via the swicth for internet sharing doesn't show any noticeable slow-response as compared to connecting via the router directly.  It works well by itself as we as with D-Link DI-704\n"

aS'\tThe isolation is great\n\tIf you\'re looking for isolation from ambient noise, these are great. I use them as In Ear Monitors for my onstage use (rock band), and if I use the foam inserts, I can stand right in front of the horn section and not get my head knocked off. \n\nI\'ve read some people complain that the bass response is not quite what they expected, but frankly it doesn\'t bother me a bit.\n\nThe only thing that\'s awkward is removing them when they\'re fully inserted for a while. They\'re rather small, and getting hold of them can be a bit tricky. I\'m using small bits of tape for "pull tabs", and it seems to work pretty well.\n\nOverall, I\'m impressed with this product since it\'s affordable and does exactly what it\'s advertised to do\n'

aS'\tSimple Review...\n\tI just use the keyboard like a business user. I don\'t use the media stuff. I really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works. I like that it\'s not huge and doesn\'t have all those extra ridiculous buttons that I never use. The rechargeable mouse is handy as well. Prior to this, I had two Microsoft wireless combos in a row, and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me. I don\'t know if it\'s because it\'s Logitech or it\'s bluetooth, but the keyboard/mouse are as responsive as were they wired (after they "wake up").\n'

aS"\tExcellent quality and design\n\tThis backpack is ideal for carrying my huge science textbooks as well as keeping my MacBook safe. Its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything I need. As a chronically disorganized person, the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings. The strap is nicely padded and it's elastic, so shocks are well absorbed.\n\nA nice touch is a zippered 'cavity' at the top, which is an ideal place to store a laptop charger. \n\nThe build quality seems excellent so far - it looks to be a very durable product. I've always had good luck with Wenger products in the past. \n\nThe best part about this backpack is that it doesn't scream 'There's a computer in here!'.\n"

aS'\tVersatile Backback, good protection, excellent capacity\n\tGreat all around backpack for lugging laptop and books to school.  It has a fairly large capacity but it also has tension straps so you can compact it.  One of the best features is the open compartment which is perfect for gym shoes or clothes\n'

aS"\tNo complaints\n\tThis is definitely a comfortable mouse if you don't have big hands. It is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely, even if you are left-handed. The extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward, backward, and switch between programs. The button in the middle though (the one that lets you switch programs) is out of the way. It takes just a bit more effort to use, meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button. I actually hardly ever use that button. I can't live without the forward/backward buttons though. I find myself man-handling other mice thinking they too have those neat, little buttons. The mouse has a really good response to movement as well. I've used it for gaming as well, though I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I really recommend this mouse. I can't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one\n"

aS'\tGreat bang for your buck!\n\tThis is an excellent product. If you drive a delivery vehicle or are in route sales this product is for you.  I am in route sales and use my laptop every minute of the day. I have an extensive territory and found it difficult to find certain places. The Garmin GPS 18 plugs right into the USB port and is powered by the computer so no need for additional attachments.  I\'ll admit "NROUTE" took a little getting used to (for example it has a list of all the streets and names of places so if it isnt on the list you\'re not going to find it) but once you figure out how it works its easy as pie.  Instead of spelling Hoover Street you just type Hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations.  A great buy for only 100 bucks! If you use a laptop in your vehicle and are in need of GPS, dont spend $500 on a 2 inch screen unit when you can get an awesome GPS sensor for only $100\n'

aS"\tExcellent three in one for its price range\n\tObviously, there are far better printers on the market.  But if you're looking for a quality 3-in-one in the $100 to $150 range, this one seems to be at the top of the pack.\n\nThere are nicer printers out there in this price range.  However, you will be severely penalized when it comes to purchasing ink.  Hewlett-Packard printers tend to be the most friendly when it comes to buying refilled cartridges or refilling your own cartridges.\n\nIt prints fast, it prints well, and I enjoy the double-sided printing feature.  This printer has been consistently rated by users as being accurate in its color prints, although I've done little color printing myself.\n\nThe scans are not the greatest as they leave small artifacts at regular intervals when you zoom in in Photoshop.  The artifact is a vertical line which bisects the picture and offsets each side by a few pixels.  They're not really noticeable to the naked eye and you won't see them unless you're editing the picture and have blown it up considerably.  Still, it's probably not the best for archiving your photos. (I expect there's a bur on the plastic gear that rolls down the rack  and  pinion)\n\nHowever, flaws are to be expected in this price range and the listed flaws of this printer are nominal.  \n\nGiven my research two months ago, and performance I've encountered after purchasing this printer, and the ease with which I was able to refill the ink cartridges; I'd say this is the best printer you can buy for $100,(as of Nov 2006) if you don't want to be extorted into paying exorbitant ink prices, for say, an Epson\n"

aS"\tPerfect for the frequent traveler\n\tNote:  This is a review of the Targus PA225U Retractable Phone  and  Ethernet Cord (Plastic Casing).  It's the rectangular model, not the oval shaped one.\n\nI'm on the road 50-75% of the time for work and have used this on almost every trip.  I initially bought it because I forgot my regular network cord while traveling and needed to buy something quickly.  I like to be able to move around in the hotel room and use this cord along with a cheap little plastic cable joiner to connect it to the hotel internet connection so I can sit on the couch or bed while connected to the internet.  I've experimented with a travel wireless router but keep coming back to the wired connection when the wireless connection has problems.  I've used it for over a year and have never had any problems with the retraction\n"

If I leave my laptop somewhere I hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad.  This is really small and compact! Perfect for traveling too.  I've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem...it still recoils well\n"

aS"\tDoes its job well\n\tI've had this for at least 8 months now. We've used it with xD, sD, Memory Stick Pro, Pro Duo(with the adapter) and a few misc. cards that friends' cameras may be using.\n\nI've never had a problem getting cards in or out, nor any problems with reading the data on them. \n\nMy only possible complaint is that the cap for the usb connector doesn't stay on as well as I'd like or have a place to store it while the device is in use. Short of that, I can't place a single complaint about the unit. It has been a well spent $20\n"
