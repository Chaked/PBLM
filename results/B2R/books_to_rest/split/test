aS'\tBiased, inaccurate, and misleading\n\tIf you want a biased and misleading account of the Arab war against Israel, this ought to satisfy you.\n\nShlaim tells us that Jabotinsky, in discussing Zionism explained that "if the cause is just, justice must triumph."\n\nI think Jabotinsky made a very good point here.  You see, human beings will, if given the chance, tend to buy land in the places they wish to live in.  The ones who can make best use of the land and wish to do so will be the high bidders for the land.  If injustice consists of stealing that land from them and justice consists of letting them buy the land and keep it (which they will wish to do if they are offered only low prices for it), then it is easy to see what the triumph of justice would mean here.  In particular, it would mean a prosperous Israel and a triumph for Zionism.\n\nShlaim appears to have missed all this.  To him, Zionism is unjust.  And to him, the triumph of terror and theft is both forthcoming and desirable.  He tells us that a new independent Levantine Arab state "is inevitable."  I disagree.  It may be likely.  But it would serve no purpose.  It would not help Jews, Arabs, or others.  Its only purpose would be to damage Israel.  The people of such a state do not as yet have an independent language, religion, culture, cuisine, or foreign policy.  So I think there is still hope that sanity may prevail here.\n\nShlaim also tells us that this new Arab state will be "weak, demilitarized, and territorially divided."  Is it just possible that this, if true, provides even more reasons why neither side might want to create it at all?   And could that make the appearance of this state even less inevitable?  Or at least less desirable?  \n\nAnd the author also explains that both sides in the Arab-Israeli conflict will have to make "painful compromises," and that Jerusalem will have to be "the subject of hard bargaining." \n\nReally?\n\nIs having peace and prosperity with reasonable borders a painful compromise?  For either side?  Of course not.  Shlaim is kidding us if he expects us to believe that war, poverty, and destruction are somehow less painful.\n\nHad Shlaim been writing about France and Germany, we\'d have seen at once that the whole viewpoint is nonsense.  He\'d have been telling us that the German National Socialists needed an independent state in France, either to replace all of France or part of it.  He would have laughingly dismissed French claims on the basis of the entire idea of France being unjust!  He\'d have sternly explained that a German National Socialist state in France was both desirable and inevitable.  And he would have discussed the necessary "painful compromises" for both sides and the "hard bargaining" about Paris.\n\nThere are plenty of reasonable books about the Arab war against Israel.  This isn\'t one of them\n\t'

aS'\tSilly book\n\tThis book is just plain stupid. If it works for people and helps them lose weight I realize they will be estatic. However, it is not healthy. Each of our meals should be balanced. These people are promoting unbalanced eating. The reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs! If one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups, including complex carbs in small amounts, we would not only lose weight in a safe manner, but we would heal our bodies from the inside out. This diet won\'t heal us, it is a fad. If anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism, lose weight and even heal disease, try reading "The Schwarzbein Principle" by Diana Schwarzbein, MD. That is a great book on how to heal diabetes, hypoglycemia, and many other things. It also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight, but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place. This book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss, not getting healthy.\n\t'

aS'\tThe Roots of Management Science\n\tThis was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author\'s task management system.  This was the beginning of the "scientific management" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.  The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.  He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.  Still, a reader shouldn\'t plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.  The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers\n\t'

Are honest business practices being pushed to the side? By normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing Martha/Mdiddy\'s crimes, are we loosing our morality?

aS'\tSadly disappointed\n\t"The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen\'s Fool" are two of the best books I\'ve ever read--and I\'ve read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin\'s Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it\'s channeled from another source, and times when it\'s harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I\'m not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I\'m going back to Trollope\n\t'

aS'\tNo stars over Yosemite\n\tI listened to this as an audiobook.  This is the worst book I\'ve ever listened to from Audible.  The worst.  The narration is just too, too cutesy sweet and the writing is junior high quality at best. Unfortunately, I keep hearing Emperor Franz Josef in Amadeus saying, "It has, well, too many notes."  Barr describes everything  (including clothes, hair, shoes, etc) with multiple metaphors, a plethora of adjectives, and, well, too many notes.  I kept yelling at the author to just shut up and tell the story.\n\nI tried three times to listen to it and just wanted to scream after 10 minutes.  I\'ve heard this woman read other books and quite liked them, but her voice and this story just don\'t add up to anything other than ear pain and a case of diabetes.\n\nWhere\'s Michael Connelly when you need him\n\t'

aS'\tMissed the mark\n\tI am a Nevada Barr fan and was unfortunately disappointed with "High Country."  The story takes place in a restaurant (boring). The characters were dull and I kept getting them confused. Anna\'s constant thinking of how old she feels is tiresome. I also missed Anna\'s sister, Molly, who is only mentioned a few times in the book. \n\nSorry, but I really can\'t recommend this book as a good read. If you want to get a feel for a real Anna Pigeon adventure, pick up "Track of the Cat" or "Liberty Falling.\n\t'

aS"\tThis book is Bedlam!\n\tThe back cover to this book was intriguing, and captured me immediately. The writing, however, was so plodding, so inconsistent, and so non-sequential that it was painful to get through to the end. This is aside from the fact that this man appears to be socially inept and unable to manage his affairs from day to day.  I can't believe that this book made it past the editors.  In one paragraph Jon Katz tells how Rose is the only dog for the job of helping him capture his runaway herd of sheet, and in the next he says that Rose is too young to herd sheep.  In one paragraph he can't live without his wife, she gives his very existence meaning, and throughout the book he describes how he lives apart from her in order to...what was it again?  Oh, right, herd sheep!  At one point the dog he loves the most is also the one he can't connect to and finally gives away.  And then can't stop visiting, even though everyone knows how confusing that would be to a dog. And why is he wondering why the world looks at grown men funny when they hang around too much with teenage boys - there's a reason, Jon!\n\nIf you care at all about literarure, stay away from this book\n\t"

aS'\tMandelbrot repeatedly claims standard models...\n\t...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better. Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they\'re written on Mandelbrot wouldn\'t have to write books like this because he\'d be cleaning out everyone else\'s wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it\'s true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn\'t know anything that countless other traders don\'t already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.\n\nBut I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot \'on tour\' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as "my work shows that..." or "I demonstrated that..." even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people\'s work he\'ll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his \'Everest\' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn\'t even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.\n\nOne time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can\'t be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing!\n\nI think it\'s also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it\'s not completely valueless. But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless. I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn\'t mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces. It just means I know how to fool the eye\n\t'

aS"\tAnother not -so- helpful rant\n\tIt is sad that this is what passes for political commentary now.  Coulter's work demonstrates exactly the potential danger for degrading society and disdain for thinking that people like Ms. Coulter piously/hypocritically rail against.  She will happily take the same formula to the bank time and again.  Why must political discussion turn to childish name calling in order to convince self-selected audiences of something they already want to believe.   Pitiful rants here.  If you are in it for fun or don't care that you are getting a skewed, sensationalist opinion, maybe you should read a few paragraphs of this in the book store.  But for something better, why not go for an intelligent book that takes an even handed, analytical approach, rather than buy into the opinions of a new breed of political analyst (on both right and left) that race to produce the most extreme charactures of any political philosophy they do not happen to agree with.\n\t"

aS'\tCrops, Crops and More Crops\n\tI had to read Jared Diamond\'s Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK\n\t'

aS"\tShockingly overrated!\n\tOur book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews\n\t"

aS"\tJust plain dumb\n\tI am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book.  I guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans, but I just don't see what was great, or even good, about this story.\n\nTwo teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people.  They are caught, they confess, and the Grandmother of one of the killers hires Spenser to prove the boy's innocense.  We are given the impression a great mystery, with possible red herrings, is about to entertain us.  Alas, it is not to be.  The kids did it, plain and simple.  Why they did it is so stupid.  The story reads as though a sixth grader has written it.  The plot is lame, and even as lame as it is, it isn't executed well at all.\n\nThe characters are boring and 2 dimensional.  The banter which takes place between the main character and others, while it seems to be trying to be witty, is just dumb and unbelievable.  I just can't say enough about how stupid this story is.  There are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping, intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one.  This is the first novel I have read by this author and will most definitely be my last\n\t"

aS"\tWhite Males Only\n\tBefore purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers'; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills, he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul's life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.  \n\nIf you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.\n\t"

aS'\tReal dogs need real care Not  quot;dummies quot; info\n\tThis book is so full of misinformation that I shudder to think (since it is in the  quot;dummies quot; series), that this may be the only information that many people will read before they embark upon a very serious commitment with a dog. \n\n It is poorly researched, full of dogma and nonsense. \n\n If you have to read a  quot;quick book quot; find one written by an expert - a veterinarian, or anyone with a track record in animals. Instant info can be found on bulletin discussion boards, magazines etc\n\t'

aS'\tDefinitely not Alcott\'s "Little Women"\n\tI started reading this book expecting to like it - it\'s historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn\'t feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book. \n\nFor one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I\'ve read other works from the time period she\'s supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus. \n\nAlso, I haven\'t read her other book so i didn\'t enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I\'m not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original. \n\nThe first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren\'t bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she\'d just speed things along at the beginning.\n\nHowever, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks\' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott\'s book. \n\nIn the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott\'s book isn\'t very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee\'s character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now!\n\t'

aS"\tDisappointing with a capital  quot;D quot;\n\tI'm in a good mood today, and feeling generous -- hence the two stars. Secrest learned that Rodgers could be a rotten person, that he drank and was a womanizer. She then proceeds to beat us over the head with it at great length. I didn't count the words, but it seemed like she spent more time on that then she did on Rodgers and Hammerstein -- not to mention the post-Hammerstein years. We learn nothing about how these shows came about and what happened to them beyond the most cursory; it's if her research there was limited to the notes on the cast albums. I've kept most of my theater books, except for this one. It went to the used book store\n\t"

aS'\tAs authentic as a daytime soap opera\n\tI\'d heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I\'d take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book.\nJames Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man\'s "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It\'s poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn\'t exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey\'s account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can\'t improve on that.\nSuffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result.\nI was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I\'m not laughing.\n\t'

aS'\tThanks but no thanks\n\tWhile I enjoy adventure stories for the casual reading they are and have read all of Cussler\'s, I was disturbed by a lot of the assumptions in this and other of his recent books.  This is transparently hawkish; an ultra-conservative defense of the questionable actions of the very furthest right of the political spectrum.  (One could even suspect it was commissioned or at least underwritten by these elements.)  It reflects the current culture that decrees all means justify the end - as long it benefits the right people.  Cussler\'s recent books portray that it\'s OKAY for Americans to go into other countries - with which we are not at war - and kill its citizens for some secret government agenda.  That it\'s OKAY for our US government to hire out "black ops" in secret because it\'s against our laws to do so openly.  Through the years, I\'ve tolerated Cussler\'s blatant sexism, juvenile writing style, improbable exploits of cartoonish heroes.  However, he has veered into political territory that offends me but even more, terrifies me that it may be the truest part of his stories\n\t'

aS"\tIs it true?\n\tMy mother in-law was actually responsible for Billy Milligan while he was in the Athens State hospital in Ohio.  I've had a chance to read this book, and although very good, what my mother-in-law tells me is much, much different. \n\nShe cared for him during his entire stay there.  She said that he had more psychology and parapsychology books in his room than she could have ever imagined.  She also said that his IQ was off the charts.  She believes (and she has a doctorate in psychology) he only has FOUR distinct personalities.  Raven being one of them.  Billy had the abilitiy and knowledge to manipulate his condition, making it appear much more severe. \n\nOf course, she can't write anything about this, because Billy's publicist made everyone caring for him sign a waiver saying they wouldn't.  Yes... Billy Milligan has a publicist. \n\nHe also was a millionaire (because he exploited his disease) and drove a corvette on the weekends they let him go home.... yep... they let Billy Milligan have weekends.\n\nThis book is a very good interpretaion on what could possibly been going on in Billy's head.

aS'\tBias Was Off-Putting\n\tDr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures.  However, I was appalled by her bias against Western cultural heritage and Christianity.  Her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women.  As a Catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded, compassionate religious sisters, I felt offended by her slur against nuns.  I am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing, but I would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research.\n\t'

There is no plot ! 2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner, the 1st mystery (Car Girls) get solved mid-way throught the book and I bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read... By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women's Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. And it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. Not much to save this book, it's even badly written.

aS"\tHate to burst the bubble....\n\tI purchased this book to gain a better insight about Aspergers.  Instead, it left me with many unanswered questions.  The book is the equivalent to a boring, monotonous `Dear Diary' that gets stuck in one era: His college years and his interest in music.  (This is understandable as the author is terrified of life outside of college,   music is all he knows.)  Yet I craved more details, I wanted to know more about Mr. Shores' childhood, his parents, the stims, and the chaos...DETAILS!\n\nIt felt as if the author was trying to prove how intelligent he is, boasting of his accomplishments and how he's almost neurotypical.  His failures were blamed on other people out to get him for unknown reasons.  Lets say it for what it is: A man who looks kind of disheveled and a bit `odd' (Unabomber) gets a job in a financial institution, he rides his bike in, hangs out in the shadows getting dressed, doesn't socialize - and no one wants him around.  It's BECAUSE HE'S WEIRD!  Yet the author blames his co-workers.\n\nI'm sorry but the reality is, the author probably can't see and understand that he IS different because he has Aspergers!   I mean, most typical people can spot someone that is odd/weird/different a mile away.  They avoid them not because they're being hurtful, they just can't relate to that person. \n\nI wished he had focused in much greater detail about his feelings, emotions and behaviors when he was younger-to gain a better understanding of what shaped him into the person he is now.  The book was written as if he fast-forwarded through his entire youth and got stuck on `pause' when he got to college.  While this is obsessively interesting to him, it was tiring reading page after page of redundant accounts of his college days.\n\nThere is no depth to the book, it was shallowly written and there is not enough elaboration to make me understand, (or want to for that part) what makes Stephen Shore the person he is.  While this may be due in part to his disorder, it left so much to be desired. \n\nI'm sorry to anyone who takes offense to this review, as this is not my intention.  I applaud Mr. Shores accomplishments and the hurtles he's overcome.  He must be MUCH more dimensional than the book conveys.   I wanted to know more about HIM and not what he's done in his life.\n\nI'd suggest a better read would be one of Temple Grandin's books.  I got a true feeling of who she is and an understanding of how she got there and how autism fits in.  She goes into details about what she was thinking as a girl, teenager and adult.  Her pranks, her temper, the metaphors and their importance..everything.\n\nI bought this book based on reviews, and I felt it necessary to give mine.\n\t"

aS'\tMuddled\n\tI usually enjoy Ms. Maron\'s Deborah Knott books very much. The characters are well drawn and give deep insight into Southern life. This one, however, is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional. The first murder doesn\'t seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just "there". The second one involving Dwight\'s son (who is a very poorly developed child character) and his ex wife is not very interesting. \n\nI devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this. Probably not, though-I foresee several storylines involving husband/stepmother/stepchild conflicts.

aS'\tThe ugliest chronicle of a true legend of our time.\n\tThe very title for the book - "I Con" - despite its cleverness, should reveal the lack of any objectivity, or class for that matter, from the authors, Jeffrey S. Young   William L. Simon.\nI could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts, poor research, colored by a palpable disdain for [arguably the most interesting legend of our time] Steve Jobs. \nWhat is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards Steve Jobs, seems \'personal\'; which, in a democratic sense, may be alright i guess, [but only] UNTIL facts begin to wear thin, and the research seems doctored, leaving the rants sounding hollow, unsavory and shrill.\nAnd the facts aren\'t well-strung together either!\n\nFrom the very opening description in the book, which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a "reformed" Steve Jobs, to Apple in 1997 (as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred), to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations, and quite often blatant slanders about Jobs, the book appears to be a collation of \'hate diaries\' maintained by two wannabe authors, whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-Steve sentiment among its readers!\n\nIf you happen to be one of those people, who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering [especially Steve Jobs], then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy\n\t'

aS'\treading this is akin to banging your head against a wall\n\tThe premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache. \n\nI have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I\'m not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that \'Kingdome Come\' was much better than \'First Horseman.\' Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum\n\t'

aS'\tNothing New\n\tWright presents no new information about Al-Qaeda, leaves out plenty of information about Al-Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "the road to 9/11."  Understanding Qutb\'s radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al-Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy.  What cannot be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss.  The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake.  The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism.  After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan, both Qutb and Strauss\' followers believed they were the cause of it.  Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "friend and enemy" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "state of exemption."  If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11, ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11.  See the BBC documentary, "The Power of Nightmares" or "From Secularism to Jihad: Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book.  If you prefer to stick with fiction about "the road to 9/11," check out Patrick S. Johnston\'s novel "Mission Accomplished.\n\t'

aS"\tRecycling Personified\n\tIf you've read one Gary Null book, you've read them all.  He is no doubt highly knowledgeable and dedicated to his subject, but when I buy two books with different titles by Gary Null and find they are the same, I'm pretty annoyed.  His early books were taken directly from Herbert Sheldon's Natural Hygience material, which I assume must not have been copyrighted, and I felt ripped off then, in the 70's as I did recently when Amazon was good enough to give me a refund for one of the books.\n\t"

aS"\tIf you like books about unicorns, read this\n\tI'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as  quot;national character quot;? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the  quot;inside view quot;--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian  quot;character quot; is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you\n\t"

aS'\tGood, but has a few errors\n\tIt has the potential to be a great book if the author had taken some time to actually look into each breed. The "Canadian Eskimo Dog" is now referred to as the Canadian Inuit Dog out of respect for the Inuit people. He has the dog\'s height wrong, and the weight range is much too high. This leads me to conclude that if there were that many errors on one dog breed, who\'s to say that it\'s not wrong on other breeds too? \nI was quite disgusted and mad to see the "designer dogs" put as purebred dogs. Labradoodles, Bichon/Yorkies, Cockerpoos, and Bull Boxers are NOT purebred dogs. They are mixes given a fancy name and sold for staggering amounts of money. \nThe first few chapters on the history of the dog is quite fascinating though, and the pictures are nice. If you need an all-in-one book and don\'t mind many errors, this is a great book for you. If you\'re like me, go down the road of buying a better dog encyclopedia and different books on different subjects rather than this faulty all-in-one\n\t'

aS"\tNot what I expected\n\tI like looking at old pictures and old letters, but I thought when I bought the book that I would actually be looking in the history of someone's life with pictures to go with it but that was not the case.  It is just a random bunch of pictures and a random bunch of letters put together in a book.  The pictures aren't necessarily the pictures of the people who wrote the letters, so you know nothing of the authors, no explanation of the times they lived in or the place they lived in or anything.  In other words, no story behind it whatsoever.  Just a disappointing collection\n\t"

aS"\tP L E A S E . . . buy something else\n\tMany reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.\n\nMost of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.\n\nFor most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.\n\nThis is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.\n\nI love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.\n\nThat, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart.\n\t"

aS'\tNot all great quotes...\n\tI wanted to like this book.  It\'s a great size for carrying around to dip into.  However, I\'d say about a third, or maybe more, I haven\'t counted, are anonymous. Here\'s an example: "Life is filled with possibilities" p31.  Now I don\'t know about you, but I\'d hardly class that as great stuff from great minds. Then I read "Decide what is worthwhile and follow through with it" and I\'m beginning to yawn. When I came to "Above all, life should be fun" and "Always keep a window open in your mind for new ideas" and I\'m just about ready to throw the book into the garbage.  Also, the format of the book is terrible.  Someone decided to put every quote into a little frame, so you get four quotes on a page.  \n\nStill, for the price, it\'s not that bad.  No, on second thoughts it\'s pretty dire.  There\'s just too many pathetic jingles in here for me, which only motivate me to demand a refund!  If I were you, I\'d save my money and put it towards something else - "The Book of Positive Quotations" has 7000 quotes and I wouldn\'t be without my copy\n\t'

aS'\tChristian fundamentalism dramatized\n\tEven the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer. \n\nThe story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions. \n\nIn the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.  \n\nInstead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham\'s biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham\'s "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell\'s Moral Majority.\n\nThey are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.\n\nThe U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism\'s growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.\n\nI see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.\n\nThomas J. Hickey\n\t'

aS'\tOuch!  Worse than Most Paperback Romances\n\tThis book proves once again, that you don\'t necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you\'ve had too much dialoge, there\'s paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.

aS'\tHoly Moly\n\tThis is the book Dan Brown\'s bestseller "The Da Vinci Code" is based on. Indeed, Michael Baigent et.al. have even sued Brown in court, charging him with plagiarizing their book. The ideas behind "The Da Vinci Code" have been exposed as completely bogus by many real historians. Obviously, this exposure affects "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" as well. \n\nThis book is methodologically flawed. It claims that Jesus survived the crucifixion and sired children with Mary Magdalene. But if this happened, there should be ancient documents telling us about it. There are essentialy only three ancient views of Jesus: the Christian, the Judeo-Christian and the Gnostic. None of them includes the notion that Jesus married and had children with Mary Magdalene. It simply isn\'t serious to reject the ancient documents in favor of modern texts of questionable value, as Michael Baigent does. Of course, a conspiracy theorist might claim that the ancient documentation is lacking due to a massive cover-up. But such an argument, compelling as it may sound, is worthless to the historian, who must work with the real evidence, meager as it may be. A claim that can neither be proven or disproven is of little help. Besides, how many sects or cults have managed to keep their esoteric secrets? Very few indeed. There is always a defector or infiltrator somewhere. The idea that the biggest secret of all times was revealed by a confused French right-wing extremist only 40 years ago is very hard to take seriously. Indeed, the fact that not even heretical groups like the Gnostiscs claimed that Jesus had sired children, is good evidence against the claim. The Gnostics, after all, made all kinds of peculiar statements. But not this one. Why? \n\nWhy are books like "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" and "The Da Vinci Code" so popular? Perhaps they say what many people want to hear. That in itself is somewhat damning, I think. For how many people want to hear the truth?\n\t'

There are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci-fi novel, rather than a book marketed for children and young teens.

The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design.

Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.\n\nIt's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.

aS'\tWhat Crash?\n\tThis book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms, bubbles, and busts.\n\nPrechter should have left it at that.  Instead, he offers up predictions.  Big mistake.  This guy bases his forecasts on Fibonacci numbers and so-called Elliott "wave counts."   He labels all market patterns so that they fit the preordained Elliott Wave 5-up, 3-down pattern.  If you see more or fewer waves than he does in any given market move, you just don\'t understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market.  He\'s imposing his theory on the market, but surprisingly enough, the market doesn\'t care.  It does whatever it wants, in however many waves it wants, and Bob has been very frustrated at the market\'s aberrant behavior lately.  He got lucky early in his career, but it seems he\'s been fairly consistently getting the market wrong since missing the \'87 crash.  \n\nAny superstitution can "seem" to work if you only look at its happenstance apparent accuracies and disregard its abundant failures.  Keep looking for certain numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and you\'ll find what you\'re looking for.  Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts, and you\'ll find those too.  The market doesn\'t care about any of those things, though.  It\'s nothing more than an aggregation of billlions of individual choices, which are influenced by an infinite number of factors none of us can ever understand fully.  University studies of various investing methods have found that Elliott Wave, like most, is no better than random stock selection. \n\nIf Prechter had chosen the random method, he and his followers would at least have a good chance of keeping pace with the market.  Unfortunately, he has been getting everything from the Dow, to oil (he thought it was going to $10), to gold (he didn\'t think it could break $400), to deflation (the "deflation" scare ended shortly after this book came out) WRONG in the past couple of years.  He apparently STILL believes that the Dow will go to 400 (not 4,000 but FOUR HUNDRED) because his charts tell him it should (they\'ve been telling him that since about 1990, actually).  Prechter doesn\'t understand demographics or economics or markets or the monetary system, all of which render "Dow 400" among the goofiest of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a giant asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population (I don\'t think Prechter is counting on that).\n\nOur debt-heavy economy may have a significant crisis soon, perhaps by the end of the decade.  It will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates.  But it\'s not happening now and it\'s not happening in the way this author has been prematurely forecasting for over a decade.\n\nThis book came out near the bottom of the 2000-2002 stock bear market, just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a new bull market.  How typical.  While promoting the book, Prechter said it was "definite" that stocks would "crash"\nin 2003.  He said that 2003 would be "the best year yet" for bears (short sellers).  Late into 2003, when it was clear that the market had proven him wrong, Prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004, the Dow would "certainly" fall below 5,000.  Wrong again!  Since his Fibonacci turn dates and Elliott wave counts fail to portend the future, maybe next he\'ll tell us he\'s found the secret code to the stock market from the text count of Nostradamus\' writings.\n\nBob Prechter couldn\'t call the market if it was listed in the Yellow Pages.  This guy couldn\'t time the market if you gave him a stopwatch.  He\'s throwing out guesses and misleading people by describing them as "definite" and "certain."  He\'s either a liar or a true believer in his own irrational superstitions.  In either case, he\'s not credible.\n\nHere\'s all you really need to know: Buy dividend stocks.  Buy short-term bonds.  Buy gold.  Hang on to them.  Do that and you\'ll do better than you will trying to follow the prognostications of market gurus.  Plus, you\'ll have a lot more time to devote to family, fun, and productive activities\n\t'

aS'\tLittle by Little !\n\tI ordered this book and read most of it in the hope that I would learn something about Familiars . In the interval between ordering and receiving my sixth sense made me begin to have doubts about Ms Little . Had she flown about the battlements of an old castle in the form of an Owl? Had she entertained A Hyrax or a Feral Cat as a house guest ? Had she ever had a pet Bat living behind a picture in the living room ? Was she acquainted with the properties of Henbane and twylight sleep and did she number Hecate among her close friends?

aS'\tA Disciplined Mind Without the "Disciplines"\n\tProf. Gardner\'s book is disappointing. He tries to be all things to all people saying both that he believes in basic competencies but wants to put inquiry first. Also, his language is inflated, and lacking in philosopical specificity. For example, he believes in building up the inner world of "mental representations" [unexplained term] yet insists on "performances of understanding" [another unexplained term]. \n\nAlso, he has respect for the individual learner and individual differences, yet he is concerned about the "position" or "situation" or social class dynamics in which the learning takes place. Thus, he fails to do justice either to the individual or to class, race, or gender.  The role of leadership in learning is wholly ignored; and responsibility is not explored.  In short, it is extremely difficult to pin down Prof. Gardner. It would be kind to say he is eclectic. I hope it\'s just not fuzzy thinking.\n\nHowever, we can discern that he has a romantic obsession with beauty, truth, and goodness. Imagine -- the Holocaust is reduced to being an illustration of what goodness is or is not! His treatment of these ideas is superficial and banal. I don\'t like to be so judgmental, but his writing about them does not deserve a detailed analysis.\n\nWhen attacking E.D. Hirsch whom he calls the main speaker for "cultural literacy," he sets up a straw man. He says that Hirsch\'s school of thought has an underlying belief in the Lockeian "tabula rasa." Yet, I find nothing in Hirsch\'s writings to indicate that he believes in a tabula rasa. \n\nFurther, is Prof. Gardner really less elitist than Hirsch as some have claimed? I have found that the Harvard elite spend their entire lives trying to achieve and learn everything, and be on top. Their lives are marked by ambition to the Nth degree; yet, he debunks time-honored and experience-honored content areas that traditionally have defined literacy at its best. Thus, I find a certain inherent dishonesty in Gardner\'s presentation.  \n\nBelieve me, friends, I have taught students who have many ideals, Greek ideals and other ideals, but know very little, nor do they aspire to learn. If they have those ideals, and if they are facile and glib, will they be the leaders of tomorrow who are embraced by Prof. Gardner?\n\nI find a tendency on Prof. Gardner\'s part to oversimplify certain issues like the Holocaust, and to overcomplicate certain others like the nature of intelligence. \n\nThe world is not waiting for the concept of intelligence to be re-written.  Am I oversimplifying when I think that there is something very awkward about saying that there is no fundamental difference in intelligence between Einstein and the custodian of my school? Is this awkwardness because I am an elitist putting down the custodian?  Is it because of lack of intelligence that I am still in the grip of a univocal definition of intelligence? I don\'t think so. Rather, we all know we are dependent on each other, and that everybody has some unique aptitudes or gifts they can express and be respected for, but trying to elevate this understanding to a higher level of truth or intellectual significance seems to me to be illegitimate. \n\nLastly, his writing style is a bit too fond of adjectives, and the book reads as a whole like It Takes A Village by Mrs. Clinton. The Disciplined Mind has a mellifluous style that presents itself as being highly sophisticated and, at the same time, as down-to-earth, with balanced common sense. Yet, ultimately, the book is boring.  As one Amazon reviewer states, Prof. Gardner is full of himself.  \n\nIn this book, there is no straightforward discussion or emphasis placed on knowledge, justice, Judeo-Christian values, persistence, responsibility, or character development...words which I find essential for a true philosophy of education.\n\t'

aS"\tYawn. More stereotypical female masochists.\n\tI bought this book because it was listed with Ellen Miller's Like Being Killed, a brilliant and complex book about a woman's love affair with heroin, her best friend Susie, and her best friend's duplicitous HIV positive boyfriend. The protagonist herself was brilliant and complex. So naturally, I expected the same thing out of Swimming Sweet Arrow. Man, was I disappointed. This was yet another trashy tale about a pathetic woman's masochistic sex life, pathetic obsession with brutal men, and pathetic quest for attention. Her entire life is a meta-existence: rather than desiring, she desires to be desired. Rather than enjoying, she enjoys being enjoyed. The male characters and the female characters are written by someone who has never met a male or female who didn't exhibit the most common stereotypes; in her world, all men are sensation-craving brutes, and all women are attention-craving doormats. The men want drugs, fun, and sex, and the women whine and cry and enjoy nothing--not the drugs, not the sex, just being a victim due to the attention it provides. This book made me really miserable to be perceived as part of this gender.\n\t"

And that's after perhaps 12 months of formal Mandarin study and a similar amount of Cantonese.\n\nDon't buy it. It's embarrassing to Christians that this sort of thing gets passed around as scholarship. If they'd wrapped it up with a plot around it, it'd make a great work of fiction\n\t"

aS'\tA Formal Analytical Review\n\t"OF PARADISE AND POWER" - BY ROBERT KAGAN\n\n"Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus" - apart from simply raising a few eyebrows, this line by Robert Kagan author of "Of Paradise And Power", has not only caught the attention of many but managed to stir up a wave of discussions among the politicians and elites concerned with cross-Atlantic relations. Kagan\'s thought provoking book became extremely popular and received international acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship, not to mention its catchy and striking phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book. Kagan introduces multiple chapters in his book, in order to deconstruct the key underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe. In the chapter "The Power Gap", Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards military and wars. He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously; they helped the US emerge as a super power. He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - "Psychologies of Power and Weakness". Kagan explains how lack of power can not only affect psychologies and ideologies, but change perspectives as well. He claims Europe\'s paucity of military power compels it to not only tolerate threats but ignore them all together and at the same time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by economic and soft non-violent methods. This chapter culminates into "Hyperpussiance", a chapter in which Kagan discusses intricate details of Kosovo and Bosnia, highlighting Europe\'s failure and America\'s effectiveness in handling the situation. He finally presents his central argument in the chapters "The Post Modern Paradise" and "The World America Made" where Kagan states, "Europe\'s evolution into its present state occurred under the mantle of the U.S. security guarantee and could not have occurred without it." Casting doubts on Europe\'s intentions, Kagan centers his argument on the growing self-centered policies of Europe and questions the validity of cohesive terms such as `west\' in his chapter "Is It Still `The West\'"? \nFinally, it seems Kagan provides a solution to this insolvable problem of the US-\nEurope divide in his concluding chapter, "Adjusting to Hegemony", by simply stating one line - "the task for both Europeans and Americans is to readjust to the new reality of American hegemony". This extremely small book, as compared to the issue it addresses needs further analysis and some close examining. There are many issues to be addressed in Kagan\'s brief analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with certain claims, reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and sensitive topic is handled. While there is a tone of underlying bias (in contrast to the general opinion of a well-balanced view that the author holds), Kagan manages to miss out some crucial facts and figures, not to mention present stark paradoxes, and the essay lacks sufficient citings.  \n\n    To start with, let me point out the contradictions in Kagan\'s arguments, the presence of which highly undermines his claims, leaving the reader in a dilemma unconvinced of either argument. Kagan claims, "Europe\'s relative weakness has understandably produced a powerful European interest in building a world where military strength and hard power matter less than economic and soft power...rules of behavior" (pg.37). He goes on to say, - "Since Europeans lack the capacity to undertake unilateral military actions, either individually or collectively as `Europe,\' it is natural that they should oppose allowing others to do that they cannot do themselves."(pg.38) in contrast to "...Europe today has the wealth and technological capability to make itself more of a world power in military terms if Europe wanted to become that kind of world power" (pg.53-54). Kagan contradicts his own views, stating many times that Europe is militarily weak, nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the same time, puts forth an argument of Europe\'s capabilities of increasing its defense spending and military might to match the US. \n    In the chapter, Psychologies of Power and Weakness, Kagan\'s one claim contradicts another which is made in the next chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely tangential. He first explains Europe\'s greater tolerance for threats is due to its weakness and the fearful past, which it has suffered from. He then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the same one with a rifle having different interpretations of the word `threat\' when confronting a bear (pg.31). But again Kagan himself feels Europe can become a military power as and when it wishes to, when he says "They could easily spend twice as much as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it necessary to do so" (pg.54). So this forces me to ask a question, would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune? So isn\'t it quite possible that Europeans feel safe, not because they "...enjoy the `free ride\' they have gotten under the American security umbrella over the past six decades" (pg.54), but rather because there was and is no real threat at all?\n\n    With the use of phrases such as "The Axis of Evil" and "Rouge States" (pg.30), which Kagan uses to describe Iraq and Iran, not to mention his references to `Weapons of Mass Destruction\' (which he uses as a pretext to the war in Iraq), which still seem to be elusive for some reason, he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his own creation. While Kagan maintains that Iraq was a threat and the US perceived it as one while Europe did not, he might want to explain as to why, in 1997, he (Kagan was the Director of the Project for the New American Century) signed a document which justifies American occupation of the Middle-East, irrespective of threats from Iraq or Iran. \n"The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein...\nFrom an American perspective, the value of such bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene. Over the long term, Iran may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has. And even should U.S.-Iranian relations improve; retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an essential element in U.S. security strategy given the longstanding American interests in the region."(pg.17 - Rebuilding America\'s Defenses - *1) \nThis forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to `cherry picking\' of evidence or he suffers from selective amnesia.\n    Some of his reasoning, analysis and analogies seem to be too naive. When explaining military action, one cannot justify it by saying, "When you have a hammer, all problems start to look like nails". The author speaks about the nation\'s (US\'s) willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so. Without discussing a need or providing concrete reasons for the use of aggression, the author seems to be content in justifying use of force, simply because one has it. One important aspect Kagan leaves out in his analysis are the political and economical aspects of the ongoing US-Europe feud. While I have discussed some economical aspects later in the review, one must note that Kagan does not mention the Kyoto Protocol (apart from Clinton\'s negotiation of it (pg.45)). The US withdrawal from the Protocol had created serious problems and divisions between the two giants (www.climnet.org - *2). While there were many other issues that further fanned the growing fire, disagreements over the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty for example, which Kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet, needed to be addressed if one is discussing transatlantic relations (www.bbcnews.com - *3, 4)\n\n    For a book which covers issues from the pre World War II decade (occasionally going back to ancient philosophy) to the present issues, 72 citations, from which many are simply extended explanations (for examples, see supra notes- 19, 20, 22), seem to be alarmingly low, especially with the absence of some important ones and not to mention, certain citations which wrongly allude to historical facts. Kagan mentions, "As `some\' Europeans put it, the real division of labor consisted of the United States making the dinner and the Europeans doing the dishes" (pg.23), yet he does not refer to any source for this cynical statement. He says, "The vast majority of Europeans always believed that the threat (if any) posed by Saddam was more tolerable than the risk of removing him" along with other alleging statements like, "The rehabilitation and reintegration of Saddam Hussein\'s Iraq is precisely what they(Europe) sought" (pg.44) , and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs. Strangely, he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note.20, pg.30, "for that matter, this is also the view commonly found in American textbooks". One might not generally expect to see such puerile purporting evidence in a scholarly analysis of transatlantic relations. Kagan at times jumps back to Athenian times and has injected strong philosophies in his essay. He mentions a number of times how Americans see the world from a Hobbesian perspective while Europeans are followers of Kantinian policies. Kagan seems to have overlooked the fact, that though Hobbes had described the state of nature as that of "all against all", the only reason Hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth. Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes (Hobbes theory itself was flawed as later philosophers termed it as `Hobbes Dilemma\') to justify American aggression, but no where in Hobbes\' theory is aggression justified by the sovereign (Leviathan - Ch.17). \n\n    There are some conclusions Kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an American idealist living in a world where politics is as pure as religion. He concludes that while the US was providing "free security" to Europe after the Cold War, "...America\'s great power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting other nations..." (pg.34) has given Europe the opportunity to build up economically. Kagan further asserts his point when he says, "Given America\'s willingness to spend so much money protecting them, Europeans would rather spend their own money on social welfare programs, long vacations and shorter workweeks" (pg.54). These are inaccurate presentations of facts, which are more of subjective, bias ideologies. I would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the conspicuous fallacy of these two statements. First, America\'s interest in Europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the Cold War. One must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the Soviet advance was purely for selfish motives, rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the watchful eye of the communist empire (Kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says, "With the check of the Soviet power removed, the United States was free to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose..."(pg26)). Second, when Kagan acknowledges that Europe which has a "$9 trillion " economy is in a comfortable position to support its welfare programs along with increased military spending; attributing the fact that Europe spends more on welfare, as he calls them "free-riders", results in a faulty analysis.\n\nWhen I had mentioned earlier that Kagan chose to omit and ignore certain facts, the example of the Balkans, which the author has cited many times in his book would seem most relevant. Kosovo is one of the primary issues he discusses to bring forth US benevolence and European incapacity. "American involvement in Kosovo or Bosnia was not based on calculations of a narrow American `national interest\'...While Americans had a compelling moral interest in stopping genocide and ethnic cleansing,... the US had no `national interest\' at stake in the Balkans"(pg.50), this is how Kagan sees it. Indeed stopping genocide was a concern, but was it the only concern? While Milosevic had very much agreed to station NATO troops in Kosovo to stop the conflicts, none seem to have been interested in his offer; they rather wanted complete access and control to all of Yugoslavia. The Rambouillet Accord, to which the Contact Group added an Appendix B on the last day of the conference held at Paris, one must note was the primary reason for rejecting NATO troops, as it demanded Yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty. Yet, he does not mention of Milosevic agreeing to station NATO troops in Kosovo (http://wsws.org *5). \n    Some thing missing from Kagan\'s entire book are the words "Latin America" and "Africa". As seen above, Kagan believes America was spending its money protecting Europe and Europe alone from all the threats around the world, before and after the Cold War. But what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does Kagan mention about any American intervention in Latin America (official or not), Africa or the Far East for that matter. Those who are well aware of the world around them, will be aware of America\'s support for dictators and other corrupt regimes throughout Latin America and the far East, Indonesia for example, which were for self serving purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the Latin American and African countries were a threat to Europe, hence the interventions and no mention of them? (A complete timeline by Steven Kangas can be found on multiple sites *6, 7, 8) \n\n    There is one severe `defect\', as I put it, which undermines the entire argument of this book. Kagan\'s tunneled vision approach, which refers to the word `power\' only in terms of military strength and capabilities, ultimately results in a false dichotomy, which is the stumbling stone for his thesis. Kagan believes the world and in particular, Europe, is left with two options, that either they follow the US or be a tacit audience. The reason he reaches this conclusion as I previously put it, is due to his convergent view. "Rather than viewing the US as a Gulliver tied down by Lilliputian threads", says Kagan, "American leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all, that Europe is not really capable of constraining the US". He reinforces this claim throughout his book (see pg- 33, 37-40, 59, 62, etc). The author\'s abysmal ignorance about hard-hitting, highly valid and relevant facts has rendered severe blows to the validity of his claims. Kagan has committed serious errors here, by ignoring Europe\'s strength, not military but political and economical indeed. With a population of 456,953,258 (the CIA Fact Book *9) and still growing, the EU, leave aside Europe, cannot be simply overlooked or brushed aside as a dead competitor or a bygone culture. Europe is economically strong enough to trouble the US as and when it wants to, the recent problems over the genetically altered meat, banana dispute, steel industry debacle, Airbus-Boeing clash and many more, have all proved that Europe\'s economic strength is much of a concern for the US.  While I must point out a rank deletion, I believe this is `the\' single factor which is capable for arguing against all of Kagan\'s thesis and arguments, and that is the American Economy. Not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of American economy (2001), even though problems did exist when he wrote this book. He seems to be blissfully ignorant and persists that America can sustain its exorbitant defense spending, "...the US can sustain its current military spending levels and its current global dominance far into the future". Strangely, the growing inflation rate, rising unemployment, stagflation, trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession, were I believe dismissed as myths by the author (for statistics see - www.bbcnews.com; http://wsws.org *10, 11). Also, Kagan\'s final solution suggest that, "The obvious answer is that Europe should.... and build up its military, even if only marginally", leaves me with a conundrum. Is Kagan implicating that Europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a new arms race, this time Cold War II? Kagan must understand he is writing this book for international publics and not simply those, whose ideologies are in tandem with his. Hence, I doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here, as we all know, there is no stopping to this evil if it once starts.\n\nWhile I have already discussed the effects of trade and economics (which Kagan ignores) on the US-Europe relation, there is something I must point out before I end this review. Kagan, rather conveniently digresses of the topic, which is transatlantic relationships, to justifying US hegemony in a neo-conservative fashion. While most Americans themselves would probably not agree with Kagan\'s ideology (as the public opinion and faith plummets - see polls from various news sources *12), leave aside Europeans or rest of the world, Kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it. This was a rather disappointing conclusion to his book, where he thinks the only solution to the ever widening divide is "Adjusting to Hegemony". When Kagan says how many (statistics seem to abandon him) Americans believe that by advancing their interest, they advance the interest of humanity, he sounds exuberantly jingoistic and to drive the point home, he quotes Benjamin Franklin as saying - "America\'s cause is the cause of all mankind" and again I must bring to the author\'s notice, the recipient of these remarks is an international audience, which is diverse, has its own culture and heritage, religious beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are inferior to any other.  An author of his stature must realize that it is transatlantic relationships and not a primary grade bully that is being discussed. While he seems to take pride in saying that America has a "go it alone" attitude (pg.39, 99), it does not abide by the UN Security Council (pg.40, 99), takes action unilaterally irrespective of international laws (pg.45, 61, 99), is justified in adopting `double standards\' (pg.62, 99), he fails to fathom the gravity of the current day (or rather the day when he wrote this book) situation and the growing unpopularity of American foreign policy around the world. While he sees Europe as an obstacle in the path of America\'s imperialistic goals, a neutral observer would be more than justified in pointing out that may be it is the US that hinders progress and efforts of the EU to establish a world which respects international laws, human rights, collective public opinion and most of all - peace. He fails to give an impartial, if not a complete solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying, "...a little common understanding can still go a long way". While many have nothing but words of praise, as a one line summary by Francis Fukuyama calls it - "Brilliant" (a co-architect and signatory of the Rebuilding America\'s Defense Project) and according to Dr. Henry Kissinger, [against whom innumerable charges of human right violations have been levied, who ironically, Kagan terms as a "quintessential realist". See - http://en.wikipedia.org(for cases) *13; http://www.thenation.com(for list of crimes) *14] the book is a "seminal treatise" which would "shape the (US-Europe relation) discussion for years to come"; I do not particularly endorse it it. As I have already put forth immense supportive data to show why the book lacks a concrete argument, sane reasoning or supportive evidence, though its lucid prose, easy comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a good read, it barely digs deep into the problem or the solution, apart from scratching the surface, `the military surface\'. Indeed the book did create waves in the political arena, which was probably due to its impeccable timing, but I cast serious doubts on the claims that it would be "discussed for years to come".\n\n\n\n*1   - http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf\n*2   - http://www.climnet.org/news/march2001.html\n*3   - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1383385.stm\n*4   - http://212.58.226.30/1/hi/business/2052405.stm\n*5   - http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/apr1999/yugo-a14.shtml\n*6   - http://www.atrocities.net/ \n*7   - home.att.net/~Resurgence/CIAtimeline.html \n*8   - www.serendipity.li/cia/cia_time.htm\t\n*9   - http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee.html\n*10 - http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/dec2000/us-d30.shtml\n*11 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1263211.stm\n*12 - http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php\n*13 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger\n*14 - http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3 pid=17\n\t'

aS'\tHighly Literate Sophomorism\n\tThis is a well written but ultimately sophomoric disquisition on the concept that if you don\'t have faith in the supernatural, you have no reason for hope. \n\nAccording to this book, the rational world is such an unpleasant place that, if you are not religious as Schaeffer defines religious, "[t]he only way of escape lies in a nonrational fantasy world of experience, drugs, absurdity, pornography, an elusive "final experience," madness... ."\n\nPiffle! \n\nThroughout history, a great many people found life to be good without resorting to either madness or Schaeffer\'s brand of religion. And indeed, religion and rationality need not be foes, as frequently demonstrated by scientists and science writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Stephen Jay Gould. Reduces our choices to "religion or madness" is just silly.\n\nSchaeffer in this book champions not religion or spirituality, but authoritarianism with a clerical face. His fans won\'t like that characterization, but my job as a reviewer is to tell you what\'s in the book; if you seek comfort in authoritarian religion, this book\'s skillful wordcraft makes it is a good place to start\n\t'

aS'\tAwkward writing makes a bad story even worse.\n\tMiddle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe.  When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status.  (But at least she\'s still got the money!)\n\nActually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it\'s hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they\'re impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazer\'s insistence on using Gracie\'s name as much as possible.  For example:\n\n"Gracie thought about it; they\'d never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning.  Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife" (p 38).\n\nI lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up.  It\'s very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published.\n\nDefinitely not worth your time\n\t'

aS'\tNot a good book for a beginning geology student\n\tI had to read this book for an Intro to Geology course, and although I find geology to be fascinating, I had a very difficult time following this book.  The author uses a lot of technical vocabulary and is rather repetitious.  Although I understood what McPhee was talking about most of the time, I think it would have made a better film documentary than a book.  The author constantly went off on tangents and the overal organization of the book did not appeal to me at all. . .it would be more readable if written as a field journal because I could not even figure out when one day turned into another.

I wouldn\'t dare tell someone with AIDS or a refuge or whomever that their only enemy is their own fears, and even for others such overpersonalization doesn\'t work.

aS"\tIncredibly boring\n\tI'm a Conan Doyle fan and found The Alienist to be a pretty good read, so I made the unfortunate mistake of buying this book in softcover without taking a gander inside. Carr seems to think he can ride his reputation for 316 pages without putting much thought into whether anyone along for the trip will get some enjoyment out of it. The dialogue is flat, the plot uncompelling and Carr relies on the near-endless use of exclamation points to inject some excitement!!! into this tale, which left me skipping pages at a time as it neared its conclusion because I couldn't bear to read the mangled sentences. This book has no climax -- just, thankfully, an ending. Spend your money on something worth reading.\n\t"

aS"\tNot quite what it seems\n\tNansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the Moon family. Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin's excesses in advance of her marriage. The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. Though I don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about. It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit\n\t"

aS"\tdoes too much and too little\n\tby focusing primarily on the history of the swimsuit Pollard's book does not address the larger issue of modesty in public dress as effectively as he might. And while the history of fashion sheds light on fashion, (i.e. swimsuits have observably become skimpier over a century) Pollard can offer no explanation except the caving in of Christian virtue. This is basically saying Christians have lost a culture war without explaining why. \n\nWhile the initial exposition on what the parameters of Christian modesty mean Pollard provides no application for what a suitable example of Christian modesty would be. Furthermore, when push comes to shove he refers to the Westminster Larger Catechism for application rather than sticking to the biblical principles he espoused. Some of his cases are self-defeating. On one hand he notes that garments in biblical periods could be sleeveless and then states that the inexorable decline of swimwear in the west into sluttiness really began when sleeveless swimwear appeared in the mid-19th century.  Props for giving the topic serious consideration but as an exegetical study it is still wanting.\n\nOn the other hand, it's cheap so if you're not persuaded the research has been effective it won't cost you much\n\t"

aS'\tBetter guides available\n\tWhen I traveled in Japan with a friend, this was the book we brought with us.  Within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in Tokyo looking for a better one.  There are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country, and the advice to get a JR pass was invaluable.  \n\nHowever, the book has a very negative, immature view of Japan as a country and travel in general.  It seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade.  Did I pay $1200 for plane tickets to go drink with Americans?  The authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites, ancient and modern, that borders on the anti-intellectual.  The cultural notes are dated, inaccurate, and shallow.  After a while, we began to think, "If Lonely Planet doesn\'t recommend it, it\'s probably interesting."  The maps, as many have mentioned, are almost useless.  Ironically for a series which fetishizes getting off the beaten path, it\'s practically useless once you get out of the main tourist areas. \n\nThere are much better guides available.  This entry has sworn me off the LP series for life.\n\t'

If Kay Scarpetta was a fortune teller, this book may have been alright...\n  What I mean by that is, in at least 2-3 separate occassions in this book, Kay says "I had a feeling I knew exactly what [so in so was going to say/do to me..."\n  Really Kay? Out of absolutely nowhere, you just believe that the unusual way Marino has been acting is due to the fact that you are going to be prosecuted by a special grand jury for homicide even though NOTHING led up to your supposed "revelation."

aS'\tWeak Link in a Great Series\n\tI read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5\'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can\'t believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read\n\t'

aS'\tGood Start - No Finish\n\tThe author had all the elements for a good mystery/suspense except for one thing, the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery.\n\nI find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as Bag of Bones and The Stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner. Fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict. A body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body. We learn the man was from Colorado but very little else.\n\nIf the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened. I would recommend a Mary Higgins Clark mystery in place of this boo\n\t'

That would be far more accurate.     For a textbook, the author freelances just a tad bit too much, a lot of what is in here is presented as fact but is mostly opinion in disguise.    The author fails in presenting a clear and unbiased view of the Middle East and instead allows his personal politics to get in the way.       \n\n    My professor dumped this book as the course textbook 1/4 of the way through the semester due to the never-ending left-leaning political commentary.    This is no serious review of the Middle East, just a socialist-based fantasy on how THINGS SHOULD BE.   The author himself proclaims that accuracy isn\'t always important, its the idea that matters.\n\n      This book is a joke, I looked for something serious, unbiased to aid me in learning more about the Middle East but this book doesn\'t present anything new and its political leanings are just to the left of Stalin.\n\n\n     If you want to learn what an extreme left liberal thinks of the Middle East, buy this book, otherwise stick to encyclopedias and hopefully, less biased college textbooks.\n\t'

aS"\tNo match for a great city.\n\tIf you're going to write about the city that is Paris, you'd better be up to the task.  Gopnik may have the writing and observation skills that would have served this assignment well, but this collection of essays generally falls flat.  For someone who resided in the City of Light for 5 whole years, Gopnik gives us a surprisingly myopic picture constrained by his own self-absorption.  Those who are interested in Paris and its natives will be sorely disappointed in the smug chronicles of a New Yorker who regards himself and his son to be the most interesting elements of this city.  I have zero interest in My-Toddler-Does-Paris stories and Gopnik's relentless insertion of his look-how-cute-my-kid-is accounts should have been saved for a family re-union instead of wasting precious space that could have been used for more interesting topics.  \n\nFor a better book on Paris cuisine and culture, check out the collection of Gourmet essays from the last 60 years titled 'Remembrance of Things Paris'.  It provides a wider variety of perspectives and a more expansive and interesting view of Paris -- and it's blessedly free of all that baby's-scrapbook stuff.\n\t"

aS'\tSee the WONDERFUL (very different) 1937 movie instead ...\n\tSadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We\'re Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O\'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it\'s best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.  \n\n\tFor example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can\'t we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, \'u\'d scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin\' ain\'t reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we\'ll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain\'t it?"\n\n\tI got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce\'s "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book. \n\n\tSo why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!

aS'\tLOST fans, don\'t bother.  Choose "Watership Down" or other\n\tFans of the ABC-TV show "LOST" will probably be buying "Our Mutual Friend" in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the "last book [I] ever [read]".  Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.\n\nWhat a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, \'padded\'.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages. \n\nDickens\' work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of \'The Old Curiosity Shop\', "I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing."  \'OMF\' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence. \n\nEven worse is the ending.  Some endings just can\'t help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.\n\nAll of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for "The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens\' oeuvre or are required to read "Our Mutual Friend", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens\' far superior works:  \'David Copperfield\', \'Oliver Twist\', \'Pickwick Papers\'.  \n\nIf you are looking for \'LOST\' reading material, I would refer you to \'Watership Down\' (Excellent), \'The Stand\' (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), \'The Dark Tower\' series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to \'Our Mutual Friend\' possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like \'Locke, Rousseau and Hume\'.\n\nNamaste and Good Luck,\nAKA Redemption Isle on TheFuselage.co\n\t'

I bought this book because in 2 months I am going to drive my rear engined 993 on a F1 circuit.  I have no circuit experience, and cannot get any coaching or any circuit experience in the country I live in.  Since this is a rear engined car which I have little experience with I was particularly wanting some tips particular to rear engined cars.  There is nothing in the whole book which is particular to driving Porsches or rear engined cars.  The only reason I will not throw this book out is because it has some interesting 1960\'s and early 19970\'s Porsche racing pictures (poor quality black and white though).  Also to be fair there are some good racing stories. He is undoubtedly a very impressive driver having been successful at the highest levels in rallying and sports prototype endurance racing.  A better title would be "My Porsche Racing History".  If you want a book on fast driving I would highly recommend Ross Bentley\'s "Speed Secrets" in place of this book\n\t'

The central character herself was unbelievable and I found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights.It seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip,cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky.

I wouldn't go so far as the previous reviewer and dismiss it as  quot;hopeless quot;, but it's certainly superficial: Postman seems to rely on secondary sources about Enlightenment thought, rather than any deep reading of Enlightenment texts.  The idea of  quot;building a bridge to the 18th century quot; seems more like a marketing device, a fresh way of presenting some of Postman's familiar themes, than a serious proposition (He even includes a summary of his  quot;disappearance of childhood quot; argument in an appendix).  It's a shame, really, because the Enlightenment has been getting too much undeservedly bad press for far too long, and Postman is correct when he points out that we owe much of what's good and admirable about contemporary society to Enlightened thinking.  For a much more substantial survey and defence of Enlightenment thought and culture, read Roy Porter's _The Creation of the Modern World: The British Enlightenment_\n\t"

aS'\tInteresting Thesis, but overlooking some important points\n\tMr. Friedman\'s book begins with an interesting thesis, defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth.  The idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that Friedman often well supports with historical facts.  However, the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis, or if he just felt the need to write a book.  Furthermore, for every chapter in the book, there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that, with a little thorough thought or research, don\'t make sense or can easily be disproven.  With these things being the case, I find Friedman\'s argument a little hard to buy.  The entire book seems to build up to the final chapter, which Friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth; this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely, however, because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book (ie. the importance of education) do not add or support his final policy recommendations.  His policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question "What should the government do to promote economic growth?"  They don\'t push the argument forward or indicate anything that hasn\'t already been suggested in the past, nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies.\n\t'

aS'\tHardcore Jargon on Intersectional Group\n\tFor decades, African-American studies scholars have left issues facing non-heterosexuals to the side.  For years, "queer" scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side.  This anthology tries to address that void.  It goes a long way in proving that black, gay academics can be just a rigorous and hardcore as white gay ones or straight black ones.  The anthology has representative numbers of men and women.  In some ways, it\'s a Who\'s Who of Black Gay Academia, including works from Cathy Cohen, Dwight McBride, and Jewelle Gomez.\n\nStill, there is much about this book that frustrated me.  A few years ago, a study was done of black LGBTs and most respondents said they hated the term "queer," yet the academics here champion it.  Really, if "queer" is supposed to represent the four groups equally, then this book was quite lacking in its coverage of bisexuals and the transgendered.  This is surprising given famous black bisexual writers such as Alice Walker, Stuart Hall, and June Jordan.  Often "people of color" is used when only blacks are brought up; Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans barely come up in this book at all.\n\nJames Baldwin is brought up often here.  I understand that.  His writings were rigorous and often dealt with racial and sexual issues simultaneously.  Still, I kept thinking about how bell hooks once wrote that Toni Morrison gets a lot of attention when publishers won\'t print the works of black women that are equally as sophisticated.  James Baldwin deserves his crown in black, gay letters, but I\'m concerned about him being the only one to get to wear a crown.  Several books have been printed about the many non-hetero members of the Harlem Renaissance, yet that group hardly comes up here.  James is getting a bit played out and the authors here are not helping change that tendency.\n\nFinally, I had beef with many of the essays.  Charles Nero has great points but his essay is really two works glued together.  Can anyone really say the whiteness of New Orleans\' "gay ghetto" is due to "Chasing Amy" or "Six Feet Under"?  One author could have written quickly about how he supported a gay, feminine student when that student was condemned by a masculine, heterosexual one.  Instead, he went on and on in unnecessary jargon and babble.  Kara Keeling\'s essay was 90% theory and 10% a discussion of Dunye\'s "Watermelon Woman."  Why bother to bring up the film if you\'re barely going to discuss it?\n\nI wasn\'t really feelin\' this text, but that\'s not to say it didn\'t have great aims\n\t'

aS'\tGood research or ...\n\tThe Case for Marriage makes arguments supportive of Pres. Bush\'s policies on marriage. However, Howard Kurtz of The Washington Post (1/26/5) reports that Maggie Gallagher was paid over $40,000 by the Bush Administration to write columns and a "private" report supporting its $300 million HHS marriage initiative. \n\nMr. Kurtz reports that Ms. Gallagher filed a column apologizing to her readers, writing "I should have disclosed a government contract when I later wrote about the Bush marriage initiative. I would have, if I had remembered it." She also states she was "aware vaguely" that her work was federally funded. It must be vaguely hard to remember being paid $40,000. Bad memory, vagueness, national column: what will we say to the children? \n\nI wonder who paid Ms. Gallagher to write this book\n\t'

aS"\tStick to Romance, Sparky.\n\tSparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does.\n\t"

Um, Rick? Have you ever BEEN there? Did you notice the 40,000 other people there all trying to get in to the same things? Did you notice the priceless and beautiful works of art on practically every surface?  Did it occur to you that people might, perhaps, want to stop and admire a large number of them? Light a candle?

Some of us, also, have to behind a crowd of 35 elderly Germans to look at Michaelangelo's Pieta, and everything else.\n\nMethinks ol' Rick either spends an average of 15 minutes apiece on the most astonishing and pleasurable spots in Rome, or is comfortable elbowing foreign senior citizens in the ribs\n\t"

About the only table worth taking is 4-1, or 4-2. Sure its a minus three to your saves, and a minus 2 to your attack power, and a whole SLEW of HP. The rest of them are so painful they aren\'t worth taking. \n\nAlso all the caster "Tables" the ones your suppost to use if your a caster but losing caster levels and spell slots left and right doesn\'t make any sense. No matter what feats and wizardry skills its not worth it. Those could have been more thought out.\n\nAlso I question the fact that in some cases the lowest tables, A, D, and G. Seem to be a lot better than the B, E and H tables just from the way they interact with things. I do fully agree that the top end capability you can add to your Legacy item is quite powerful, the I table is filled with many useful things the you wish you could have picked two of them. What I wish/want was if they\'re was some way to trade lower level slots to get you the capacity to get two I table skills. Also some way to get either more or less slots if you take a less dangerous or more dangerous tables of the legacy grid.\n\nThe rules for weapons and fighters/barbarians/paladins/rangers. Are very well thought out and are very powerful. Yet for anyone other class they need heavy modification to be workable. In a Caster heavy campaign like the one I run and participate in its a very low value book\n\t'

aS'\tThe Celts in Ireland\n\tMr. Cahills book offers an interesting and controversial take on history. He is an excellent and compelling writer, but his differentiation between pre and post diaspora Israelites when discussing the Celts in several of his books is not always clear. \n\nIt was only the post-Babylonian diaspora Southern Kingdom Israelites who came to be known as Jews, around 500 BC. \n\nIt was the post-Assyrian diaspora (721 BC) of the larger ten-tribed Northern Kingdom Israelites who became what we today call the Celts. It is they who are both the Island Celts who populated Ireland, Scotland, Wales, etc., and their cousins, the Continental Celts who sacked the Roman Empire under many Celtic tribal names and who make up most of northwest Europe today.  \n\nThe author could perhaps clarify this part of his presentations on European history by reviewing losttribes.net or any other modern Celtic site based on contemporary archeology.\n\t'

I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I\'ve read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can\'t care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I\'d picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I\'ll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I\'d much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn\'t think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big "Aw, c\'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" from me.  For those who haven\'t read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.

aS'\tGood First Effort But Needs Improvement.\n\tConsidering that this is virtually the first attempt (as far as I know) at a Dictionary of the Pentecostal/Charismatic movement, this is a good start. It is worth the price for what it does contain but it is not without glaringflaws.The title  quot;International quot; leads one to expect much more coverage of Pentecost outside of the U.S. Canada, where Pentecostal movements thrived in parallel with those in the U.S., is given very scanty treatment.Some major early Canadian apostles, such as O.J. Lovik, are skipped entirely. There is also too much opportunity given for some controversial movements to propagandize. A balanced article would necessitate an article by an unbiased observer, rather than by the leaders of those movements.Finally, there is too much credence and space given to sociological assessments of a movement that requires, above all else, keen spiritual discernment to separate the wheat from the chaff. That said, I will consult my copy often, for the great amount of useful material it does contain\n\t'

aS"\tSnow White became Chuky\n\tIf you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever.\nWhat's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen. \nMcCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore.\n\t"

aS'\tCould have Been Great But No Cigar!\n\tI\'m sorry to say, this work will not rate very highly on my scale. \n\nThe author is brilliant, not to mention right on the things he says. It\'s just that the writer\'s style is so abstract and nebulous that he\'s absolutely maddening to try and follow. One moment, he\'ll be talking about how religion evolved, and the next he jumps to an illustration that takes half a page and uses language that is so illusive you ask, "What in the world is he saying now?" I got so excited in the first chapter while things made sense, and then noticed how he drifted here and there, making good points and then totally abandoning them. \n\nI bought this book three years ago and just recently finished reading it because I had to keep going out of my way to put it down and come back to it!! It never seemed to get better. I gleaned a few good points and enjoyed it...well...sort of, but the author is so unclear at times that it drives you nuts - and this is coming from an atheist who agrees with the philosophical position of the author!\n\nOverall, I really cannot recommend it unless you are a VERY slow, contemplative reader who doesn\'t mind an unorthodox read. Other than that, the book is packed with some good info. I just wish I could have gotten to it more easily.\n\n(JH)\n\nwww.ministerturnsatheist.or\n\t'

aS'\tSteve deserves a better effort\n\tWithout question a book is needed to address the origin and history of late night television and Steve Allen\'s pivitol role it. Sadly Ben Alba\'s "Inventing Late Night: Steve Allen and the Original "Tonight Show\'\', is not that book. It is, largely, a poorly edited and self-contradicting pastiche of previously published memoirs by Allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with Allen\'s TV contemporaries. These interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers Scott Berg (Sam Goldwin) or Neal Gabler (Walter Winchle).\nThe opening chapter, which addresses Allen\'s dysfuntional up-bring, education and his early days in radio and TV sets the stage for the author\'s failure to create a full-blooded, well-rounded analytical portrait of Allen and his work. Alba draws here, almost exclusively and certainly uncritically, from Allen\'s memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two early reviews. Taking Allen and the reader\'s one independent witness at face value, Allen had a rootless, violent and unstable childhood. Given these negative conditions Alba gives  no hint of how, why or even if, Allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally unstable mother and her equally troubled extended family. The author gives us two brief stories from Allen\'s adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured. Actually, all the stories show is that Allen attended an uncle\'s funeral and very briefly troted his mother out once on his Sunday night show. How did this dysfunctional world of Allen\'s youth effect his two marriages and five sons? Why, after a childhood on the fringes of a perlious show business existance did Allen choose this same career field for himself? Alba doesn\'t even pose such questions about the boy\'s effects on the man. He just plows ahead in a haliographic haze. Throughout "Inventing..." Alba maintains this pattern of unquestioning acceptance Allen\'s words. No other witnesses are called, no other points of view are examined. Steve tells a story; Alba accepts it and edits it into his text. Why not read Allen straight?\n\t'

aS'\t"Fictional stories of scientific falshoods"...\n\tIf you are interested in learning about the *actual* science of food, but don\'t want to learn any science, at least read a book by someone who *did* learn it.  There is so much grossly erroneous information in this book that he discredits himself entirely.  "Oil is more dense than water-- and that\'s why it can be heated to higher temperatures than 212".  As a chemist and formulator I can assure you that nearly all oil is lighter than water, and even if it weren\'t that\'s *not* the reason it has a higher boiling point.  Ever make oil   vinegar salad dressing?  Ever seen crude oil on the ocean?  How about the funk on top of old greasy dish water?  Folks, oil floats on water... and the earth is not flat.

aS'\tNow that the DailyKOS crowd has finished posting\n\tI\'ve always been a big believer in "attack the message" (if you don\'t agree), don\'t attack the messenger.  The reverse has been almost standard practice of the Left when they can\'t refute the truth, facts and common sense of conservatives.  Which is close to 100% of the time. \n\nSo I have to be very careful not to copy the Left when I write as a fifth generation Kansan and having lived all of my life, thus far, in the same "upper-middle class" suburb Mr. Frank seems to so despise in his first and only book.   But his book was so filled with errors, personal opinions disguised as facts and mislabeling of events, people and general culture, as to make it a book of fiction; not one of fact. \n\nHe stated himself he had every advantage presented to him early in life but he chose not to take advantage of them.  He relishes being a victim and seems to mostly be upset that he wasn\'t born into a poor family of migrant laborers.  Perhaps born as Ms. Condoleezza Rice?  She is certainly a good example of someone held down by evil conservatives and not permitted to excel in life (not).  Living in, and exposed to, the surroundings of his childhood, it appears to me his life\'s goal was to become a professional victim and a loser in life where the deck is stacked against you from birth.   He\'s, so far, at least succeeding in that!   Being an accomplished loser.   What a goal! \n\nHis only "accomplishment" was the writing of one book that could only be believed as fact by disciples of The DailyKOS.   \n\nHaving written his fictional book of what life is NOT like in Johnson County, Kansas and how he was stopped cold at every turn of life\'s losing lottery, he really has nothing else to say.   Perhaps he can now survive as an invention of the Left writing the same type of fiction over and over (as he just did for the NY Times).  He must be a very unhappy person.  It seems most liberals are.  How sad.  The only real obstacle they have in life is seen in their mirror each morning.  That\'s it no matter how much they deny reality. \n\nHe seems like an intelligent young man who had everything going for him.  What a waste of talent.   Now, he\'s just another "victim" doing his best to convince everyone else they too should just give up as they can\'t win in life no matter how hard they try.  As I intimated, I\'m sure glad Condoleezza Rice ignored people like him!  I just wish people like him were fewer in number and that more ignored their delusional vision of reality.\n\nChecking in from Kansas, he is a "one book wonder".\n\t'

aS'\tagenda here?\n\tWell in my opinion, there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies, and some people have had some unusual experiences (mostly disturbing, but some apparrently enlightening), but the question is, is it all as it seems?  The fact of the matter is, various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us.  Holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys (this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events); there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario; advanced, drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now (Verichip).  I\'m not saying that other lifeforms don\'t exist in the Universe (far from it), and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas, but this idea that there are little, menacing Greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense COLLUSION seems suspect.  It smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us.  Historically, there\'s been the Barbarians, Huns, Mongols,  Pagans, Jews, Christians, Vikings, black Natives, Cannabals, red Natives, Mexicans, Germans, Nazis, Communists, now the Arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on Earth.  Even President Reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80\'s.  The fact is that with known technology (not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked), they could quite easily pull the hoax off.  Even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and PRACTICED (albeit "underground") than most people can fathom.  What has become another fact is the major extent to which the UFO community has been infiltrated and compromised, of which Strieber has been front and centre at various times.  My belief is that Strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign, sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups.  In this book, his "hard-evidence" is flimsey and suspicious.  For example, why wouldn\'t super advanced Aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue (thus not showing up on any X-ray, MRI, CT, etc)?  And design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body?  Surely, this would be child\'s play for Alien scientists?  Why no major discussion or mention of the human military, or NAZI connection with abductions?  There seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange "fragments" of memories that are slipping through various memory covers.  Why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the Greys?  Why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms?  Why are some speaking English, others German?  Why is there a connection with deep, underground bases and specifically Antartica?  These are things Strieber never mentions, which I find curious.  My point is, things are happening, but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what, and Strieber\'s books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas.\n\t'

aS'\tdisheartened\n\tI came to Blowback by way of a year-long research project on  globalization. Over the past year I have read dozens of books, both scholary and popular, on this topic. Right - Left - Love America - Hate America - Multi-Cultural - Eurocentric; I\'ve suffered through them all ( happily, there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject ). \n\nFirst let me state that Chalmers Johnson, this regrettable book notwithstanding, is not by profession the village diot. Johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst, a man who used to be worth listening to.\n\nWhat happened?  How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg? Where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from? Johnson, where did you go?\n\nWell, the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge.  His take on America\'s military policies is ludicrous.  Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50+ years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north, where he will discover NORTH KOREA. Of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy.  Conspiracy "theory" is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated; it\'s their sanctuary; but for a scholar of Johnson\'s caliber to go there is incomprehensible. Unti you see what I saw.\n\nThe professional works that I read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free-trade and concluded more-or-less-nothing, all in scholarly language.  For the most part the popular books were  not nominally about globalization at all, although globalization was the only thread holding the books together, and to each other. Brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the mustard-gas-like effect of that era at your peril ),the only possible reason for these immensely angry, nonsensical books is this: no one fully understands globalization.  No one. Even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast, too young to tame; growing unpredictably every day like the Blob. They\'re frustrated, these authors.  I can\'t blame them, but for some reason they must have a scapegoat and the\'ve rounded up the usual suspect, America, as in why does America impose - dominate - ignore, etc. the third world?  Silly question, really. You\'re at the top of the food chain, what do they expect you to do? When bad things happen you want to be sure they happen to someone else.\n\t'

aS'\tMy faith has been shattered ...\n\tin the possibility that Steve Berry could ever transcend his not-so great debut, The Amber Room.  Romanov Prophecy started in the right direction, Third Secret was OK, but I think he hit his *peak* right there.\n\nI really want authors to get better--heck, I hope to write better papers as I go along in college.  But, Steve Berry, sorry.  And for all you people out there who don\'t like it when people give negative reviews of a book you like, just hang on a second before you give me a big fat NO vote.  \n\nFirst of all, even though this is fiction, the whole Da Vinci Code genre purports to be based on fact.  Berry always writes his Note at the end to underscore this.  However, if you want the reader to accept your plot, please get some basic facts correct first.  The most annoying one for me, as, ahem, a French major, is the very dramatic chapter closer where they zip off to the "Palais des Popes."  Excuse.  Me.  "Popes"?  Just because the English word looks kind of like the French word "pape" (for pope) doesn\'t mean you can flippantly swap them!  Eek.  And, btw, this is a real place, so some editor somewhere should have noticed this.  Shame on you, S.B.\'s editors.  OK, I\'m not saying a novel must contain no anachronisms whatsoever (it IS fiction, after all), but really big, glaring mistakes of geography or history cannot be tolerated.\n\nThe other main issue I have with this book is the vehement attack on Jesus Christ and the resurrection and the Bible as a whole.  Cotton Malone, our hero, says that the Bible contains hundreds (I\'m paraphrasing) glaring inconsistencies.  If I remember correctly, he says that one of the gospels (he picks on Matthew a lot) doesn\'t place Bethlehem as the place of Jesus\' birth.  That one doesn\'t hold water--I checked Matthew myself.  Says so in ch. 2.  I don\'t mean to thump the metaphorical Bible, but who is Steve Berry to question the authenticity of the world\'s #1 bestseller ever?  That\'s quite audacious ... some would even say blasphemous--but I tread on glass.  \n\nI really can\'t go into the terrible character development, or lack thereof, or the wussy Knights Templar.  Yeah, they\'re big and bad, but Malone seems to bump them off with the greatest of ease.  Some "Knights of Christ" they are.  \n\nWell, having alienated most of you, I bid you farewell as I go in search of a more worthy book\n\t'

Its framework neither breaks any new ground in the study of the sociology of business or organization behavior, nor is it a particularly useful addition to the realm of self-help pop-business literature.

aS'\t5 stars? Really?\n\tMark Rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in America.  Most of his ideas are solid, but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word "interesting" to describe it.  Did they actually read it?\n\nThis book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different, yet equally boring ways.  I honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever.  This book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original, not to mention solid, ideas.  The nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument.  \n\nNot only was the book dry, but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the US is a part of, and in particular, the role that immigration plays on poverty in the US.  He talks about the US and the people in it as if they were static, but we live in a very fluid world, growing more fluid everyday, and I feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument.\n\t'

aS'\tA B movie in Paper Form\n\tI picked up this book at the airport as I was heading to Japan. While staying with my in laws in the country, there is no English language anything. This is all I brought so I had to finish it. But it was a struggle. \n\nFirstly I like complex thrillers, and I liked all the Tom Clancy Jack Ryan series. Technically excellent, if with totally one dimensional characters. \n\nThis book reminds me of the original Star Trek, where everyone but the Captain is affected by the virus. The hero is always right. \n\nBell can write, his prose, I think is fine, but the scenarios are sometimes laughably implausible. I also agree with another reviewer here that there is an unpleasant racist overtone in some of his depictions of some of the bad guys. \n\nOverall awful, just awful. My first and last Bell book. I will be leaving the rest of the Bell collection on the shelf\n\t'

aS'\tAnother Awful Book\n\tLet me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I\'ve read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.\n\nI truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she\'s lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn\'t let books like this be printed.\n\nThis story pretty much follows stories she\'s done before except it\'s told from the guy\'s point of view.  There\'s the rich guy, Charlie, who can\'t seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he\'s afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.\n\nThen there\'s rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let\'s him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.\n\nThe last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.\n\nThe three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie\'s yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don\'t want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.\n\nDanielle Steel should stop writing.  You can\'t tell me she doesn\'t have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won\'t even bother renting them from the library.  I won\'t waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I\'m going to read them\n\t'

aS"\tAstoundingly Poor\n\tIf an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery, you'd think they'd have a lo say about it, right? Well, Ford certainly expends plenty of words, but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel-gazing group of stories. Mind-numbingly similar in tone and temperament, the ten stories center of upper and upper-middle class white, middle-aged, married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity. Story after story plods cautiously along, poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way, with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness. Adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite-of-passage for a disconnected male. Marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons, and yet Ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it. I have no idea what his personal background or situation is, but it's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something. If he wasn't such a literary bigshot, there's no way this would have been published-it strikes the same note over and over and over, and isn't provocative, insightful, or even interesting. PS. If you were planning on the audio version, don't. Ford is a terrible reader, sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment\n\t"

aS'\tBAH!  Correction Please\n\t"Karl Marx, years ago, gave a description of why this might be happening. He followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value: an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make." \n\nNO IT\'S NOT!!! An object\'s worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers. To imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a few minutes to make is worth far less than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an atomic bomb that took months to make, which would mean that we should subsidize the military-industrial complex, since all those workers worked hard to create those deadly things. \n\n"Petty-bourgeois\' owners, i.e. the mom-and-pop stores and small business in general, of which my grandpa, a dentist, was a part of, are being driven under by corporate chain competition in retail." \n\nThis is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the massive regulations burdened upon them by the government. All regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out. There\'s a reason why the owner\'s of Wal-Mart recently said that the federal government should increase the minimum wage to over $8, as this would cause many smaller businesses to go bankrupt, lay off employees, and prevent future businesses from starting up to compete with Wal-Mart. Another problem is the subsidies that the smaller store pays to Wal-Mart (Wal-Mart collects millions in subsidies due to Marx\'s Labor Theory of Value once again) and of the use of emminent domain abuse (which can be justified on the grounds of the "greater good" as opposed to the individual good of your mom and pop stores). \n\n"But no theory is ever flawless, and socialists should be able to correct their past flaws to account for human nature and "reality." There is no reason to believe that heavy social hierarchy and class division is a necessary evil; workers CAN manage their lives just fine through cooperatives." \n\nSure there is. Human beings are inherently unequal, differing in many skills, abilities, ambition, the choices that they make in life, how they apply their time, etc. etc. Of course, there is isn\'t any reason that individuals can\'t create wealth nonetheless, creating goods and services that help others out in exchange for some good or service itself. And cooperatives need to be voluntary first. Nor can cooperatives produce the bulk of wealth.  There needs to be some Division of Labor, Trade and Commerce, etc. or else all cooperatives end up as hunter-gatherering tribes reduced to the real law of the jungle to survive.  This can\'t happen if everything is collectively owned. \n\n"Since workers are the sole producers of goods from scratch to end" \n\nNO! Entreprenuers, innovators, etc. provide much of the creativity, design, direction for the purchase and use of capital goods, negotiation of deals, evaluation of threats, problems, and consumer requests, and other such things. It wasn\'t the workers at Microsoft who created cheap desktop computers, it was Bill Gates, the workers are merely a form of mass-production who help out, but ultimately mass produce a good or service in exchange for privately owned wages, caused by supply and demand.\n\t'

The King Arthur stories read like little more\nthan a description of events; one doesn\'t really get a feeling\nof being there while things are happening as in "Robin Hood."\nThe dialogue seems much more realistic in "Robin Hood", but I\nthink there\'s more to it.  The writing style in "King Arthur" \nI\'d characterize as prosaic---in sharp contrast to the charming, poetic style of writing in "Robin Hood."\n\t'

p159
aS'\tPAIN AS GOD\'S MEGAPHONE\n\tSince God is Infinite Goodness, we must conclude that the appearance of reckless divine cruelty is a delusion.  When we are comfortable, we are too shallow-minded to realize that we need God.  Since God knows that He is the only thing that we really need, He inflicts pain upon us to wake us up to this fact.  So pain is God\'s megaphone.  If some people, such as the Jews, try to love God without going through Christ, it is not yet God - merely the best approximation their fantasy can attain.  Hence poor God is forced to keep screeching at them through His megaphone.  But even people who try their hardest to love the true God, such as Job, or C. S. Lewis for that matter, cannot adore God as much as He wants to be adored, so He uses pain over and over again to "plant the flag of truth within their rebellious souls."    \n\nWhere does this notion of an Infinitely Good God come from?  Given mankind\'s painful existence, "an inference from the course of events in this world to the Goodness and Wisdom of the Creator would be preposterous."  God had to reveal Himself to mankind by Revelation; thus it is in the likes of Abraham and Moses, who identified God as righteous, that all peoples are blessed.  Lewis informs us that God expostulated with His own creatures on the basis of their own ethical conceptions - "What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me?"  One has to wonder if Lewis has ever actually read the Bible.  Can anyone really deny that if a leader of today did exactly the sorts of things that Abraham and Moses did that they would be decried by all of sane mankind as monsters?  I have never understood why, or how, I am supposed to pretend that this is not true.  Of course, God is wiser than me, so if I could only see it from God\'s viewpoint, I would see that the butchery of whole populations, including babies and animals, was actually an act of love.  In MERE CHRISTIANITY Lewis condemns this line of reasoning in eastern religions as "damn nonsense."  Undoubtedly, we get the impression of a just and loving God through the teachings of Christ, but the conviction that God is Infinite Goodness, Omniscience, and Omnipotence did not come from biblical revelation; it was developed by medieval Christian philosophers by reasoning through extrapolation -- a process that Lewis, rather inexplicably, deems impossible.\n\nLewis\'s insistence that people have free will needs to be examined.  Even as he describes it, since we are born in sin, we cannot use free will to avoid sin, and most people are blind to their sin.  Hence, it logically follows that there can be no free will without the ability of self-perception.  The evidence suggests that incessant pain, especially when inflicted upon children, destroys this ability.  Abused children typically grow up to be abusers.  In my own case, I adamantly insist it was the drug, marijuana, which first gave me introspective ability, at the age of 23.  Prior to that moment, God knows that I had no free will.  Free will is not a realized trait that we are born with, but a potential ability that requires a great deal of effort to develop.  In most people it remains largely dormant.  Since free will is dependent on self-knowledge, the role of religion needs to be the development of introspective ability.  Dogmatic adherence can only hinder this.\n\nLewis is at least honest enough to acknowledge evolution.  Unfortunately, it is hardly possible to reconcile the notion of evolution of man from animals with his fairy-tale notion that animals only exist by destroying each other because they were corrupted by Satan before man\'s appearance on Earth.  Somehow, the perfectly good "Paradisal Man" descended from animals already corrupted by Satan.  Lewis can be abominably silly sometimes.\n\nLewis is given to disjunctive, either/or, logic.  Either the common human experience of supernatural awe is a mere twist in the mind with no biological purpose, or it is direct experience of the supernatural - a Revelation.  I would once have scoffed at this, but a Numinous vision of Christ was the major turning point of my life.  The problem is that this Revelation was not at all consistent with Mere Christianity.  According to Lewis, the purpose of pain is to break our will, since it is our tarnished wills that keep us from God.  I had only recently come to realize that I had not had free will until my sense of self was awakened by an illegal drug.  I experienced Christ in the very moment that I was cursing Christ for demanding that I beg forgiveness for that which He was responsible.  Albeit, at the time I was an atheist, and was only cursing at what I had been taught about Christ.  I experienced Christ as the core of my being, not as an entity completely separate from myself, and as an awakening of will, not a surrender.  Lewis assures me that the feeling of being one with God, rather than a creature of God, is Satan\'s ultimate deception.  But I have also experienced Satan within myself.  If Christ were not the core of my being, I would never have survived Satan.  I know the difference.  I do not acknowledge that Christianity has the authority tell me what my experience of God must be.\n\nI am a scientist by training, not given to superstitious credulity, however much like it what I have written above must sound.  In my attempt to make sense of my experience of Christ and Satan battling within my mind, I have come up with the following myth:  It is, at least, not completely unreasonable to assume that consciousness is an inherent quality of existence.  This consciousness would first be in a primordial state, probably in some way responsible for evolution, though not by anything like intelligent design by direct control.  There could be no distinction between good and evil; in fact the terms could have no meaning, until consciousness evolved to a complexity capable of self-awareness.  As self-awareness developed, so did awareness of pain and terror, and a rebellion against achieving a level of awareness capable of experiencing pain.  The human mind, as the vessel of consciousness experiences these antagonistic trends and, for whatever reason, tends to personify them as God and Satan, or their various cultural equivalents.  What makes the Christian God so detestable is His complete refusal to accept responsibility for anything.  Satan can therefore be described as "God\'s self-ignorance."  Buddhists are apparently able to put themselves into the conscious state of inanimate matter, hence there insistence that good and evil are identical.  C. S. Lewis tells us that "it is not God\'s purpose that we should go back into that old identity."  I think I agree with him on this point.  Mankind\'s goal must be to attain free will be becoming conscious of what we really are.\n(Peter Payne, author of CAPTAIN CALIFORNIA:  A YOUNG MAN\'S ENCOUNTER WITH THE EVIL WITHIN HIMSELF)\n\t'

On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90\'s when the book was written, and it just doesn\'t read as the brilliant critique that I expected.

aS'\tWish I could get my money back...\n\tAs a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler, this book was a BIG disappointment!!! I bought this book after reading the reviews and wish I hadn\'t paid more than $1 for it. While the title "The Unprocessed Child" accurately describes Laurie\'s upbringing, this book shouldn\'t be grouped with other unschooling literature. The author, while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter, reminds me of the mother in "Love You Forever" who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son\'s room at night to spend time with him--sweet but a bit creepy. The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with Laurie pretty much says it all. The mother clearly has her own issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she\'s not spending 24/7 with her only child. We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all--and I feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them. If you want to read a GOOD book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter, I would recommend "Homeschooling our Children, Unschooling Ourselves". Those authors offer more balance and eloquence than Ms. Fitzenreiter.\n\t'

aS"\tNot Christie's best\n\tHmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the  quot;who, where and why quot; were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd\n\t"

If the big bang were true, then there were animals before man. Animals that lived and died.  The Bible says that man\'s sin is the reason why we die and suffer.  If death was around before sin ("For the wages of sin is death") then what good would Jesus\' death on the cross have been\n\t'

aS'\tE for effort\n\tI am agreeing to the comment of "E for effort" on this book.\n\nThis book describes the author\'s attemps to improve his condition and how he suceeded. But he admits in his book that he is not sure which ones actually worked. Plus, the author also takes diabetes medications, along with other medicines and supplements. My main concern is what worked for him probably won\'t work for someone reading this book.\n\nThis book does not really provide a clear picture on what to do. He made so many changes on the medications and supplements, it is hard to say what worked.\n\nOne can find the general imformation presented in this book on "Diet", "Exercise" and "Stress management" (relating to clog arteries   heart diseases) through the internet. I didn\'t gain any new information by reading this book.\n\nThe printing of this book is also done in a very strange way. \nThe text is printed at the center, occupying only the center area with a lot of spaces around, so about half of the page is blank.\n\t'

aS"\tInteresting, but not an ethics.\n\tI found the book thought-provoking, but there is more to philosophy than provocation. The common underlying argument of this book, and its only valid statement as ethics, is that since the only purpose of ethics is to regulate human behavior, the ethics society adopts should reflect the kind of society we want to live in. This results-oriented approach is all very well, but Singer doesn't really build upon it through any legitimate philosophical argument. Virtually all of Singer's arguments about particular issues rest upon emotional premises that the reader either does or does not accept. If you accept the premise you are likely to find at least some merit in the argument; if you don't accept the premise, its impossible to follow along to any useful conclusion. In short, these are not ethical writings but the political writings of someone who is too smart for standard political discourse and not interested in limiting his thoughts to philsophy as a discipline. How useful you find this is up to you. I personally don't know Singer from Adam and had not received any prior indoctrination about how groundbreaking he was before I picked up the book; as a result, I have trouble seeing what people are so excited about\n\t"

aS"\tMixed feelings\n\tI've used the lonely planet guides on other trips before, and have always been very pleased, but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth.  LP was the only guide we purchased, based on our previous experiences with them, but we had the chance to peruse others in the B B's we stayed in throughout our trip.  Of all of them, I'd rate the LP as the 2nd best for our interests - as they say, individual experiences may vary!  Ireland has become a very expen$ive tourist destination, so upon reflection, we would have been happier with the Rough Guide.  LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide, and has ended up short-changing all of them in the process.  I hate to say it, but I'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best.  I'd still put it above most of the other guidebooks though.\n\nOur first and foremost gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are.  I realize it was published two years ago, but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20% more than LP listed.  That's quite a jump for 2 years, indicating to me either poor fact-checking for the 2003 edition, or some pretty crazy inflation and a need for another update.\n\nOur second gripe was the local maps.  They failed to provide maps for a lot of the smaller cities, and only provided maps of the city-center areas in the larger ones.  Given the rarity of Irish street signage, those maps would have been a God-send for navigation in towns.  Also, and this may be a function of the 2003 printing, a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting one-way patterns in their city-centers, and LP's maps rarely identified this.  \n\nA third, again related gripe is with the existance, or lack thereof, of the various restaurants, b b's, shops, etc. listed in the guide.  Probably 30% of the restaurants in the guide just aren't there any more.  I realize they must have been when it went to print, but that didn't help us any.\n\nOur last gripe is the rather uneven coverage of large areas of the country.  Granted, it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - heavy coverage of larger cities and popular tourist areas along the coasts, pretty awful coverage of less touristed interior areas.  Unfortunately, we didn't just want to go where all the other tourists go, so this left our noses still further out of joint.\n\nOverall, I'd say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well, both LP and Rough Guide do that.  If you want to keep the expenditures down, Rough Guide does it much better.  If you want to go all out, um, there's probably a third option, but neither of these two will do it well.  If you want to be thrifty in some areas and splurge in others, then this guide is the closest you'll get to filling your schizophrenic needs in one place - although, in that case, I'd really recommend getting two guides, one for each end of the spectrum.\n\nOne last piece of advice - buy a heritage card when you get to your first castle/tomb/historic place!  If you plan on visiting more than one or two historic places, its 20e cost will be recouped within days with all the free admissions it will get you for the rest of the trip\n\t"

I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic.  I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.  \n\nApparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics.  Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.\n\nThis book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand.  Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them.  This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude.  This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable.  Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.\n\nIf this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization.  Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.\n\nAnd Asimov is a mediocre writer.  The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed.  I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated\n\t"

aS'\tNot so good\n\tFirst off, so much of the copy is devoted to his horrible sense of humor, imagine a junior high school student "acting big" to impress his friends with jokes, that type of annoying bravura humor is simply unrelenting throughout the book.  It is filler.  The illustrations are sized so big the actual technical content of the book is quite low.  Just more filler.  Finally, all the techniques in the book can be found during normal operation of PS, or at worst a few internet searches.  I think this book is over-priced and I wish I could return it.  Caveat emptor\n\t'

aS'\tMary Mary\n\tTotally disappointing.  From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .  I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.  Alas, there were none.  Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board   try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher\n\t'

aS'\tWhere has the magic gone?\n\tPROS: 1. John Corey is still a funny, memorable character.\n\nCONS: 1. Very little suspense. The author\'s use of a doomed character\'s point of view--switching to third person--to tell the reader all of the hows and whys of the main villain\'s Dr. Evil-esque plan ("FIRE THE NUKE!"). Then, after we know everything, we get plopped back into the first-person, investigative head of Corey, who doesn\'t yet have the story solved. The result is predicatable and tedious.\n\n2. The don\'t-look-behind-the-curtain (gratuitous?) use of the Ted Nash character, who makes a brief appearance at the end...despite having died in NIGHTFALL...and, uh, THE LION\'S GAME. Why is Ted\'s appearance so brief here? Well, he admits to screwing Ms. Mayfield. Naturally, Ms. Mayfield opens fire and fills Ted with bullets. Presumably, Ted\'s dead for good now. \n\n3. The politics of DeMille\'s novels has been present in other books, but it\'s never been this catty. Why is the nuke kook a right-winger? (Hey, why not?) I should have known when the jacket cover said the book "will challenge you to question everything you thought you knew about your leaders and your country." The only thing this book has made me question is how anyone can seriously be more worried about conservatives nuking L.A. and San Francisco than the real terrorists out there...the ones who want to slit throats and post the footage on the web.  \n\n4. Continuity problems from how the last book, NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all. Yep, they are bothered by 9/11, but they are both working their same jobs, apparently having gotten over the whole sickening coverup (witnessed via videotape) that the "accident" of the TWA flight 800 was really caused by a missile. There is passing reference to this, but not much. Apparently, a guy like Corey doesn\'t do much soul searching. He just keeps going to work. In realilty, it\'s hard not to notice that DeMille still doesn\'t know how to deal with the storytelling hole he got himself in with the last book.\n\nCorey is really all this book has going for it. And, while in his capable hands the world will be saved from kooky nuclear schemes from kooky Republicans, he can\'t save this book.\n\nI think I\'m done with DeMille, for better or for worse\n\t'

aS'\tNo creativity and not very lasting!\n\tI recently picked up a copy of Mage: The Awakening not knowing quite what to expect. Since Ars Magica I\'ve loved Mage. From GURPs I quickly switched over to White Wolf\'s editions of Mage: The Ascension, finally setting on the revised copy most commonly used on game sites today.\n\nMage: The Ascension Revised was truly a delight, featuring a complexity never seen before in role playing games. A complexity that made working magic truly fun, sure there were flaws, without a good Storyteller you could easily abuse the open ended magic system to do absolutely anything you wanted... but it was a good price to pay for flexibility, interesting possibilities and an all around great RP system.\n\nIs it fair to compare Mage: The Awakening with Mage: The Ascension Revised? Of course not, the game has to be based on its own merits and flaws. The problem is that this game seems to suffer from a lack of creativity which pervades the RP modern RP market. It also seems to be marketed toward a very specific audience.\n\nWith the exception of some really interesting RP books (White Wolf\'s translation of "Engel" from the German, a role playing experience distinct onto itself and wholly creative, and "Demon: The Fallen" - which was unfortunately a flop and still managed to be creative), RP books are typically very bland and all the same. \n\nMage: The Awakening is no different. Unfortunately it tries to blend easy mechanics with simple spells as though past Mage books have been too complicated (which they haven\'t, unless the new World of Darkness market is much younger than they previously were... which is a possibility, or perhaps they aren\'t interested in realistic depth so much as they are just having quick fun). \n\nThere is absolutely nothing culturally significant about the Mage: The Awakening game system. If you enjoyed the Buddhist, Hindu, the various forms of Christian, Judaic and other religious outlooks being present in your game system, Mage: The Awakening takes a step back from the pluralism/intellectually stimulating material found in its predecessors and offers a quick, fun system with no lasting appeal.\n\nThe background story of Mage: The Awakening is simply terrible. Sure reviews constantly pick on Atlantis, but for a good reason: there\'s simply nothing else to pick on! The Awakening is simply devoid of any depth whatsoever, but what it does do is provide some interesting magic rotes (spells) instead.\n\nAnother problem is that there are no antagonists. In previous Mage games there were antagonists you could use or not use depending on your game. In Awakening they don\'t even offer any choices. This game is obviously less popular online and more popular in tabletop settings (online, where depth is usually called for, Mage: The Ascension is still used quite frequently).\n\nSome positive qualities about the book are that it has an excellent production value and it provides a concrete game system to play with. Provided you had an excellent Storyteller present with lots of storyline ideas, you might have a fun tabletop session. But quite frankly aside from the production value I can\'t recommend this book. The largest problem of all is that it simply has nothing distinctive about it... nothing to make it stand out and be worth playing over previous game systems.\n\nIn an age of simplicity please do yourself a favor and have a little patience and find yourself a good Storyteller. Go back and read the books that made this one sell like hotcakes - buy the "real" Mage books - if you still want to, pick up a copy of The Awakening and somehow incorporate it in your game\n\t'

aS'\tI thought I\'d come away with useful information...\n\tI bought this book thinking that I would learn something new about the cosmetic industry. Not only did I not learn anything, I came away from the book wondering just how someone could\'ve accumulated all of that information without being able to present it in a better way.\n\nThis book is packed with non-scientific fluff (using ill-defined terms such as "toxin" and making blanket statements with no evidence such as "Scientists involved [sic] mechanical science--as I like to call it--do not understand plant science, but scientists, who know plant science, understand both [grammar and punctuation left exactly as in the book].") About 60% of the book is packed with charts and glossaries. And I have to say that this is the worst-edited book I have ever read, with constant typographical errors, misspellings, and apostrophe problems. There just doesn\'t seem to have been a lot of thought put into the actual execution of this book.\n\nLook, I am certainly this book\'s target audience--I shop at Whole Foods, use organic skin-care products and potions, and work out six times a week. I care about my body and what I put into it. But this book is not a good use of anyone\'s time or money, as all of its information can be found quite easily (and in most cases with better grammar) on the internet. You\'re better off buying _Fast Food Nation_ if you\'d like clear, concise information about what you\'re putting into your body\n\t'

aS'\tA soap-bubble book\n\tI was disappointed greatly at the time I opened this book. HUGE gaps between strings, LOTS of empty space on pages - all this is for masking the simple fact: this "200 pages book" contents could be easily printed on 80 pages or even less. And, more, these pages are filled with useless "interviews" (who wants to read an interview INSTEAD of explanations?!) and other empty words. \n\nThe book is supposed to teach us how to make modules for NWN 2. But it doesn\'t. See, the chapter about scripts consists of 4 pages - is it REALLY enough for such a great theme? (These pages, I mentioned it already, are less than 2 pages...). \n\nThis book is better than nothing. A bit. Because SOME useful information it provides.

aS'\tNot very satisfying at all.\n\tI\'m a pretty diverse reader, so I decided to give this one a go.  It started out somewhat interesting, but then just sort of made me keep saying, "Okay...what\'s the point here?"  I really like Ninah, the main character, but I keep waiting for her to break free from the chains of this commune she lives in.  I guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this, but I closed the book wondering, "why did I read this?"  I grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the "punishments" just ridiculous.  I\'m pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions, but this was just way out there for me.  Ninah\'s relationship with her Nanna was the neatest one in the book.  I\'m glad I\'m finished...now I can move on to something more fulfilling.\n\t'

aS"\tLook at it from the child's point of view...\n\tFirst off, I have not read this book myself, so disreguard this review if you want. I'm reviewing it because based on the reviews and what I can tell here, and from descriptions from my own mother, I believe this is the book she used in a failed attempt to potty-train me. I am 99% sure, but she does not remember the title so I can't be 100% sure.\nMy mother described a system where she devoted one day to nothing but potty-training. She got everyone else out of the house, and removed all my toys from eyesight. Then she went through a detailed explanation using a potty doll and had me try to explain it back, using the doll. She then showed me what looked like a whole kitchen full of little toys and candy, and told me I would get rewarded for using the potty that day. I remember all that part. After that she said that we went through a process where she had to scold me for accidents and we did nothing but try to go potty all day. I was definately old enough to be doing this, because I actually remember it. (I am 25 now, so if this book was published in the late 70s or early 80s, I'm being accurate.)\nNow, let me tell you the results. I don't remember how I felt that day, but I do know that it started something that became a huge emotional battle for me. I was a very sensitive child, and I am a very sensitive adult. What mom and I remember was that potty-training became a war in our home- and it took YEARS. Because of my sensitivities and my mother's poor choice in training methods, I began holding my bowel movements. (I was able urinate in the potty at a normal age, not sure when.) I would hold bowel movements whenever I had the urge to go, even if she put me back in a diaper. I held for weeks at times, and sometimes this required a lot of pain for me (obviously). When it finally got to the point that I couldn't hold it anymore, the BM was so big that I needed physical help to go. Sometimes it would get so bad that the opposite result would happen- I'd have a sudden diarheaa because the muscles were fatigued. This went on for years, and the doctors kept telling mom that I'd eventually outgrow it. She tried suppositories, oil, fiber, and even started giving me adult doses of laxatives. Finally, when I was 5 (two years into this), Mom made a tape recording of me SCREAMING while trying to go to the bathroom. A doctor took pity on us and prescribed enemas. I used them on and off for two more years. I was finally fully potty trained- AT SEVEN. I am now 25, and occasionally I still notice some health problems that may be attributable to this.\n\nNow, obviously there is no way I can fully explain why all that happened, and I certainly can not blame all of that on the book. I was a very sensitive kid, and my mom picked a bad time to do it too (I had just had a baby brother). But I just want to describe the danger of using a insensitive method. And I'm not just talking about the pain I went through there- if we're to believe Freudian theories about the anal stage of childhood- well, let's just say I could be his poster child.\nI am now potty-teaching my own highly sensitive daughter, who will be 3 in a week. We have been working on this (no specific methods, just lots of sitting on the potty) for over a year now, and with NO results. But I'm not in a hurry, and thats because she's not ready, and we need to do this on her timetable, not mine\n\t"

aS'\tTOO SEXUALLY EXPLICIT FOR MY TASTE\n\tAs I was reading this book, I came across many poems that were far too sexually explicit for my taste, to name a few:  "The First," "Early Images of Heaven" and "Full Summer."  I found these poems to be highly offensive, and improper for the general audience.\n\nHad I been warned of the book\'s sexually explicit content ahead of time, I would not have read it.  I believe that it should be so marked on the cover so potential readers know what they are\ngetting into\n\t'

aS'\tMisinformation and Euro-centric\n\tYou can tell I don\'t pay attention to Wall Street Journal or New York Times. I picked up David Sacks\' book from Borders\' Linguistics stack because of the title. I should have known better. \n\nI started the first chapter and didn\'t have the time or intention to finish it. The book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of alphabetic writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks, in my opinion, systematic thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of alphabetic writing that is found in other scholarly works (scholarly it is not). \n\nEven within the first 20 pages or so, I was disawayed more than a few times by dubious claims, utter misinformation, and distastefully Euro/English-centric. Here are some examples:\n\n"The alphabet was not the earliest writing: Egypt, Mesopotamia, and probably China already had nonalphabetic systems. But the alphabet was the most efficient writing system ever found, before or since (p.1)" -- What about Hirogana for Japanese? Syllabaries can be much more efficient for languages that do not have a large inventory of syllables. \n\n"The \'spreadability\' of an alphabet means that the future of our Roman letters looks very bright indeed. (p. 10)" -- He was speaking of languages that are written in multiple alphabets, such as Swahili, Serbo-Croatian, Urdu/Hindi, and Yiddish. And then came this proud comment on the prospect "our Roman letters". Immediately following the above quote, he gave examples of Azerbaijian and Tatarstan\'s decision to switch to Roman, as well as other "struggling nation"\'s likewise decisions to "switch to Roman letters for native tongues, as a big to tie into global trade and communications and to better prepare their prople to learn English. Tragically, much that is venerable and spiritually sustaining while be lost. Yet that seems inevitable in the 21st century were are shaping. And it is sobering to reflect that our 26 letters wield such power."\n\nHis view of the learnability of the alphabet is also uneducated, shall I say. The following superficial comment could have come from an old gradama who happened have NOT been a teacher for her lifetime. \n\n"An alphabet enjoys on huge advantage over any other writing system: It needs fewer symbols. No other sysmtem can get away with so few. This makes an alphabet easier to learn. Students need memorize only two dozen or so letters to begin building toward literacy, which typically takes about another five years of instruction". \n\nAnd -- he writes -- because of this simplicity, children can become literate before the working age. "This cricial fact has made the alphabet historically the vehicle of mass literacy. (p.5)" Well, "vehicle" is a very clevery way of framing it. At least he is not saying that where there is alphabet there is mass literacy. Mass literacy was nevery a goal before the inducstry revolution. Now Sacks joins the ranks of you-know-who\'s by implying that the Europeans and Western ideals were destined to take over the world because they had the alphabet and probably the mandate from God. (Guns, what guns?)\n\nSacks also compared "our 26 letters" -- as if alphabetic writing is patented at the USPO -- to Chinese. "Today Chinese schoolchildren normally take three years longer than Western children to learn to read and write, with most of that \nextra time devoted to mastering the symbols." \n\nThis is completely misinformation. Learning to read Chinese is not easy, but do a little research, you will find studies over studies and books over books on comparitive studies of literacy (including my own). I\'ve nevery seen a credible study that substantiates the 3-year lag. By the way, Sacks almost never gives citations. \n\nI think that\'s enough. This explains my total disappointment with the book -- I sholdn\'t have any high expectation from the start, had I known who David Sacks is.\n\t'

aS'\tRepackaged prepared foods\n\tI was INCREDIBLY disappointed with this book purchase - especially because I paid FULL PRICE for it. I have absolutely NO USE for it. Why? \n     Why pay money for a book that simply takes prepackaged cookie and cake mixes, and adds a handful of nuts or dried fruit, (thus, making it "homemade") to give away? Anyone with the smallest amount of natural creativity could do this on their own, without the instruction of a cookbook. Let me give you an example: One of the "recipes" in this book is for lollipops.\nYou melt down other lollipops or pieces of hard candy and drop a stick in the puddle. WOW. That is CRAFTY. How ridiculous. Even worse, - as you will see by the illustration, - the "homemade" \'lollipop\' looks disgusting. The stick is about four times as thick as the paper-thin puddle of liquified old hard candy. I wouldn\'t DARE give such a thing away as a GIFT.\n     Only a handful of recipes in this book are actually scratch-made from ingredients. The premise of this book is dressing up premade prepackaged foods from your local grocery store, and slapping some notions from the craft store on a glass jar or paper box. While some of the presentation ideas are original and attractive, in general it will prove a grave disappointment to an experienced cook.\n     I have given this book two stars because it does present lovely photo illustrations of every "recipe", and may give you inspiration for packaging and presenting your best recipes as gifts...... but if you have any creative talent and cooking skill whatsoever, - I advise you to seek out another book on this subject. It is not worth the cost of the book.\n     Should you be interested in the simplicity and economical value (the craft notions to dress the package will cost more than the food you are preparing)found in this book, - PLEASE- buy a USED copy, - it isn\'t worth more than $3 bucks. This is definitely a publication for a very inexperienced cook - and it is only for such a one I would recommend this book\n\t'

aS"\tExcellent and broad survey of the development of civilization with all the punch of high quality fiction!\n\tThis is going to be a short and sweet review because many others have commented on this book at length. I want to contribute my two cents as a concise opinion based on its value as a powerful, engaging and thought provoking story.\n\nThis book packs the punch of great fiction. It covers a broad territory from the ice age to the present with the drama of an epic. You certainly don't need to be a history major, biologist or anthropologist to be moved by the story of civilization as told by the author.\n\nJared Diamond places a very strong emphasis on the role of geography, environment and other factors that relate back to nature in the rise of civilizations. I think the major shortcoming of his work is that he doesn't give enough credit to social factors and their role is history.\n\nIf you don't know a lot about history or how physical factors in the environment contributed to the rise of agriculture, the need for armies, etc. You will find this fascinating reading. If you have a deep knowledge of these areas, anthropology and sociology, you may find the overly reductionistic stance annoying. However, most likely you will enjoy the well-written story if you can keep in mind that it doesn't provide the full picture.\n\nIn short, this book magnificently illuminates Jared Diamond's specific areas of interest, while downplaying or neglecting others. It provides a valuable piece of the truth and it does so in a very engaging and thoughtful manner.\n"

aS'\tThe Struggle of Faith and Duty\n\tThis was the first novel I read from Endo, and I have to confess to being hooked on it from the first. It is both interesting from a historical perspective, taking in an event that was singularly fascinating, and deeply profound from a psychological perspective. It is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day.\n\nHasekura is a deep character, and the reader spends a bit of time with Hasekura\'s thoughts. This is especially so as Hasekura confronts the emaciated, dying Christ that he sees on his travels toward Rome. The possibility of faith in this "pathetic man", and the conflict that produces with his duty to Lord and ancestors, forms a a deeply emotional narrative coupled with Hasekura\'s desires, dreams and simple wishes. The psychological aspect of the book is very well presented and notable in its impact.\n\nA notable part of the book is tied up with Father Velasco, whose ambition seems to know no limits. His own struggles with ambition, and the self-justifications that he employs, are a lesson worthy of remembering. \n\nThis novel is a great one, and I was hooked to the very last page. It will take you into the world of Hasekura, Velasco and their companions, as they themselves see it. It will take you into their dreams, their hopes, their fatalism, their fears and their struggles to cope with their situation. I totally, unreservedly recommend this novel. I love this novel\n'

aS'\tGo ahead, Have another one.What\'s one more gonna do?\n\tDry is anything but what the title of this work implies.The pages drip with boozy escapades and one can almost smell and taste the liquor on Augusten Burroughs breath.A must for drinkers who would like to stop or at least reassess what the heck is going on in their lives.Almost motivational in its honest appraisal of the difficulties inherent in this addiction. The writing style is clear and refreshingly down to earth,funny, yet foreboding and diary-like in its presentation.Burroughs clearly transmits via humor and self awareness the many dimensions of this destructive addiction and the problems that can come with it, especially the limited usefulness of rehab.The story itself is pretty hip with a good look inside the mind of what we could easily call, "a hard core drinker" as he anticipates the "next one".Passages describe a variety of interpersonal dilemmas,job and sexual conundrums.Dry is also a good insightful look at how the treatees view the treaters and how quickly they can size up weaknesses and exploit them.This is a page turner but it does drag a bit in the middle, yet has a strong finish.An earlier work \'Running With Scissors\' was apparently good enough for Hollywood, so take a shot with DRY.After all, when your liquor bottles occupy more living space in your place than you do, it might be time to slow down,stop and get a copy of Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions, and a copy of Dry.  CHEERS!!\n'

aS'\t"I don\'t think it sounds like mice."\n\tThe quirky illustrations done by the masterful Dave McKean at once contribute to the book\'s charm, but also lend to its dread. However, this is not a book for especially wee ones or children prone to nightmares. Some people may not appreciate Dave McKean\'s artwork as much as they should, because it is so different, at least to those not familiar with the Sandman graphic novel series written by Neil Gaiman in which Dave McKean did the cover art for all the books. At first glance the layout might seem confusing, even distracting, yet it somehow works here. Neil Gaiman has crafted an eerie tale that befits his style of writing. He introduces us to a charming young girl named Lucy, who suspects something is not right with her home. And though her pig-puppet seems to share her concern and understands her fear, the rest of her family do not...until it\'s too late. The action waxes and wanes until all seems resolved in the end, though perhaps it is not. You be the judge. This is a worthy book to read to third-graders and above, though some younger children may be able to stomach the tale without any concern. Neil Gaiman deserves praise for bringing his brand of storytelling to a younger audience, one so unfamiliar with his other work. I highly recommend this book\n'

The Democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the 1960s.  Indeed, if the Democratic Party returns to power, the war on terror will be severely compromised---if not lost.  Even theological modernists like myself recognize that the Republican Party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order.  And yes, we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like Senator Lincoln Chafee.  But what about the Republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands?  These folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006.  Many of them possess a suicidal Nietzschean streak.  In their heart of hearts, they idiotically believe we should let the Democrats win so that the Republican Party can be "purified."  The author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis.  Hopefully, he starts to do so real soon before it\'s too late.\n\nThe crybaby Republicans are particularly dangerous concerning the explosive illegal immigration issue.  A number of them come across as nativists who despise Hispanics.  We cannot, however, forget that the children of numerous illegal aliens are often American Citizens.  They get to vote at the age of 18---and will most certainly seek revenge on the GOP for harassing their parents.  Let\'s get something straight: we are also not going to send an estimated 10-12 million people back to their original homeland.  But aren\'t these individuals breaking the law?  Human law is not about the striving for utopian perfection.  Yucky sausage making compromises are occasionally required.  I may have a few complaints about Hugh Hewitt\'s newest book.  Still, you need to purchase a copy.  His overall advice is indispensable if you truly love your family and wish to protect the United States from ruin. \n\nDavid Thomson\nFlares into Darkness\n'

aS"\tOne of the best books of 1997- or any other year!\n\tJust when you think you've got Gemmell figured out, he turns the tables on you.  Fans of Gemmell and Jon Shannow might find the book a bit slow at first, and something of a retread of previous Jerusalem Man tales, but be patient...the master has got some great surprises up his sleeve!  Readers unfamiliar with Shannow are strongly advised to go back and read the previous Stones of Power books before this one.  You won't be disappointed.  Gemmell is one of the most important fantasy writers of the late 20th century\n"

aS'\tPSYCH-K is a wonderful tool for making big, positive changes in my life.\n\tI have spent my life wishing that I could change things over which I seemed to have no control.  Rob explains that the reason for this is that my subconscious mind is holding on to old beliefs that are limiting me.  He goes on to tell how PSYCH-K is a safe, powerful, and simple way to change those beliefs using balances that integrate the hemispheres of the brain.  It is prayer coming true for me quickly and lastingly.  I have followed up reading the book by taking the Basic and Advanced training workshops and am using PSYCH-K to find "peace" in my life and am helping others do the same in theirs.  This book is written so that it is easy to read and very informative for someone like me who is looking for ways to improve their life\n'

aS'\tA Look at the Death Penalty\n\tThis book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on "death row," at least in the state of Mississippi, and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences.  It touches on activities of the Ku Klux Klan. It was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty.  However, some sympathy is found for the victims of crime.  The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime.  Sam\'s grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from "death row." The latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution.  Meanwhile Sam shows repentance and response to the prison\'s chaplain.\n\nI found it to be one of the better John Grisham books.\n'

aS"\t6 Stars and more really - wonderful cookbook and book\n\tThis is wonderful! It is for fans of Laura Ingalls Wilder, and also for those who are interested in historic cooking - from prairie and colonial days which have their basis in so many of the cultures which settled America in the early days, and adapted for use there\n\nThis book is a very happy blend of the Laura Ingalls stories and the food which was eaten, interspersed with the recipes and how they would have been prepared and cooked. Of course Laura didn't include any of the actual recipes in her book and so they have gleaned from similar cookbooks and so on of the day. It has been adjusted to modern need for exact temperatures and measures.\n\nI found this book so lovely to read through, not just browse through. The interest factor is great - learning what things were available, and how they were used - baking soda, yeasts, how the oven was used, what cooking items they would have had access too as well as some of the stuff we should know but forget - seasonal food avaialble. But it is good as a simple recipe book. It is an incredible look at times gome past\n\none of my best reads in the last few years, I also bought a Prairie cookbook which I would highly recommend as well - it is more of a recipe book than this one, but a lovely complementary book to it\n"

aS'\tAre "you" in this book?\n\tYou, the reader, are the subject and the hero of Calvino\'s novel, an exercise in reader-response theory gone mad. Calvino\'s lively experiment begins by describing a reader (that is, "you") reading Calvino\'s novel and, after this opening, "you" settle in to read the novel that you were "meant" to be reading--a noir mystery with a cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter. \n\nBut all is not fair in the Land of Fiction; the copy of the book has been misbound by the printer, so you have to rush to the store to get a properly printed book--only to find that the replacement is a different book entirely. After several tricks and machinations, you end up reading the beginnings of ten different books, written in ten different styles, yet all sharing place and character names and even themes. (Part of the fun is identifying the author being imitated: the most obvious segments mock Borges, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov.)  While initially it seems that Calvino assumes you are male, soon you are introduced to the Other Reader and "you" see the story through her eyes. Both of you work to solve the mystery of the erratic book passages, and the pleasure of reading is heightened by romantic tensions between the two of you.\n\t\nThe book alternates between the story fragments and the story of "you." The repeated changes and interruptions in style and story can be baffling: "You can\'t get your bearings: the characters have changed, the settings, you don\'t understand what it\'s about, you find names of people and don\'t know who they are." It\'s a bit like "Groundhog Day," except that instead of being stuck inside the same day, you\'re doomed to repeat ten different but terrifyingly similar acts of literature interruptus. \n\nWell before the end of the novel, you realize that the real story is not to be found in any of the parodies (mysteries, fantasies, and romances) that you desperately try (and fail) to finish, but in the story of your reading experience itself--an experience made all the more complicated by the web of conspiracies engendered by the Other Reader, a reclusive popular writer, a charlatan churning out counterfeit books under the writer\'s name, a sloppy and conniving translator, and various officials of repressive dictatorships.\n\nFor the reader who doesn\'t mind when an author attempts to describe your state of mind, Calvino\'s novel can be pure fun. The success of Calvino\'s task depends in no small part on whether the reading experience he describes recalls how you read a book; I know that some readers find some of these passages alien ("That\'s not how I read books"), but for me the various descriptions of the reading experience were both perceptive and eerily familiar. This reader, too, found the first half of the book far more engaging than the second half; later in the book, the gimmick inevitably wears a little thin and the detours that spoof publishing conglomerates, repressive governments, and state censorship were a bit more than this short novel could handle. And the "solution" to the puzzle, although fitting, has the oomph of the finale to a shaggy-dog story. No matter--if you enjoy metafiction, you might just recognize yourself in this clever book\n'

aS"\tIt's not too late for Bob.\n\tThis book was very candid and well written. It shows that Bob primary goal was to build a business, and become rich and he succeed. The idea that he sold it as a media for African American pride is what got him in trouble.  Pulley shows that it was  quot;strictly business quot; Mr. Johnson need not so defensive, what he created made him rich, this book shows that wealth does not equal respect?

aS"\tA must for costumers\n\tIf you're interested in reproducing authentic costumes, you won't find a better guide to hats and bonnets than this book.  I haven't found anything close to it.  Intended for collectors, it is full of photographs showing what women wore on their heads for the 200 year period covered.  Today a hat is usually something worn strictly to protect from inclement weather.  Until a generation or so ago, no woman felt dressed in public unless she wore some kind of hat.  It's a valuable addition to any costume library\n"

aS'\tHurricanes, other killer storms   reporting on these to the public\n\tBackground\t\n\tI read Isaac\'s Storm, by Erik Larson, around 1998. Recently I had occasion to thumb through it again which has prompted this review. Larson covered three killer hurricanes, two killer blizzards and one flash flood.\n\t\t\nGalveston and related Hurricanes\n\tMy first impression was that anyone who had read this book, about a major hurricane, would never consider riding out such a storm. Larson painted a frightening story of brick homes and brick schools being torn apart by the surging waters. \nIsaac Cline was the U. S. Weather Service Chief at Galveston at this time. This book gives much detail on the Galveston storm. This hit the island in September 1900, with very little warning. Indeed it was the arrogance of the U. S. Weather Service in general, and Issac Cline, their station chief for this area, in particular, that essentially preempted any warning. "Cline was one of the \'new men\', a scientist who believed he knew all there was to know about the motion of clouds and the behavior of storms." First, the U. S. Weather Service refused to pay any attention to any inputs from Cuba. The U. S. Weather Service had men stationed in Cuba who "said the storm was nothing to worry about." Cuban\'s "own weather observers, who had pioneered hurricane detection, disagreed." Secondly the U. S. Weather Service insisted that, any storm warning had to come from the Washington office, with absolutely no exceptions. Finally Isaac had the conviction, and public position, that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston. With such a position Cline had no motivation to try and influence headquarters. \n\tLarson cited two older hurricanes in his book. \n* September 16, 1875 - "The storm raised an immense dome of water and shoved it through Indianola, pushing the waters of the Gulf and Matagorda Bay inland until for 20 miles the back country prairie was an open sea." This storm took 176 lives.\n* August 20, 1886 - This storm completed the destruction of Indianola. So many residents were killed that the survivors abandoned the town completely.\n\tIn 1891, "in the wake of a tropical storm that Galveston weathered handily" Cline  was asked to appraise the city\'s vulnerability to extreme weather. Isaac wrote: "The opinion held by some - - - that Galveston at some time will be seriously damaged by some such disturbance is simply an absurd delusion." He made this statement in spite of the fact that the maximum elevation of Galveston Island, at that time, was an almost trivial 8.7 feet above sea level. He made it also in spite of the two killer hurricanes hitting and destroying the town of Indianola, about 150 miles southwest of Galveston on Matagorda Bay.\n\tCline had a "model" of Gulf hurricanes, namely that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston. His "model" of these storms was clearly fatally flawed, or politically influenced, and it resulted in 6,000 to 10,000 deaths. \n\tLarson suggests there was a "scent of boosterism" behind this article, and that he was writing an article that Galveston promoters would be happy to see. Could this have been a harbinger of things to come? Could Cline have been the first government weather scientist to prostitute himself by writing favorable papers on the weather for his sponsors?\n\tThen the storm hit. Both the U. S. Weather Service and Isaac Cline looked very arrogant before the storm, and also in defending their overall performance, after the storm.\n\nOther extreme weather events \n\tLarson also covered two blizzards and one flash flood in his book in this book.\n* Hail and flash flood, August 1885 - "a severe downpour near San Angelo, including hailstones the size of ostrich eggs, killed hundreds of cattle and created a flash flood with An escarpment of water that Isaac estimated to be 15 or 20 feet high."\n* Blizzard, November 1888 - this surprise blizzard destroyed 150 vessels off New England, and caused the death of 450.\n* Blizzard, January 1899 - "this blizzard swept much of the South. Icebergs 10 feet high flowed down the Mississippi past New Orleans." This storm even hit Galveston and piled snow on it\'s beaches and drove water out of the Bay into the Gulf exposing portions of the bay bottom.\n\nConclusion\n\tIsaac\'s Storm shows the incredoble wrath of hurricanes, 105 to 125  years ago. It also depicts the incredible spectrum of extreme weather events, also of the same vintage. All in all a most interesting and rewarding book, one that I would recommend highly.\n'

aS"\tAnother winner\n\tTerrier will not disappoint Tamora Pierce fans!  The narration is done through first person, told as a journal.  This is particularily challenging for authors to do well as it is easy to loose the flow of the story, and difficult to account for actions the narrator hasn't seen. But Tamora has performed her usual magic, snatching up the readers' interest from the first page and holding it until the last (I even read all of the notes pages and the bio).  Readers may find it difficult to put down.  Once again it will be hard to wait for the next boo\n"

aS"\toff the shelf just in time\n\tThis thing sat on my shelf, half-read for the longest time.  Only the notice of the upcoming release this November of Pynchon's next got me motivated enough to dig into it again.  It's not that it isn't brilliant.  No one else around can dazzle you with so much wit and wonder.  The first encounter with the talking dog is as magical as anything you'll ever read.\n\nAnd it's not like this is the only Pynchon novel that takes some effort to get into.  There are plenty of folks who have had to to take a couple cracks at V or Gravity's Rainbow before catching the wave.  \n\nBut Mason and Dixon is a lot of work, if for no other reason than the effort it takes dealing with the mid-18th century prose style.  (Can you imagine the effort it took to produce it?)  John Barth's Sotweed Factor is  similar, and yet somehow infinitely more accessible (and highly recommended!).  Pynchon's gift for rapid exposition is not necessarily suited to the constraint on verbal glibness.  Especially in a work this voluminous.\n\nAnd yet the darn thing is consistently challenging, if one has the patience and energy to put into it.  It seemed to me that the beginning and ending were the best parts, but this could very well have everything to do to the enthusiasm one brings to a new book, and the emotional satisfaction one gain's when reaching towards the conclusion.  One thing for sure, for once Pynchon truly has plotted out and delivers a conclusion worthy of the whole work, as opposed to suddenly rushing out a trap door and leaving the reader in a state of suspension (which of course is also one of the many delights of his first three novels).  This time one gets the sense that the author has a good deal of affection for his featured players.  \n\nThis book is a great as you want it to be, if you're willing to work at it.  I'm just looking forward to the next one being a little more nimble.  (Meanwhile, I've got a couple months to see if I can make more of a dent into The Recognitions.\n"

aS"\tNow Make It A Screen Play\n\tThis audio-book was fantastic. It took off like a horse out of the starting gate at the Kentucky Derby and never let up.\n\nVincente Callabrese is a part time enforcer/collector for the mob and part time movie producer student. When Vincente is asked to produce one of his classmates screen plays this is a start of a new career for Vincente.\n\nFirst a name change, from Vincente Callabrese to Michael Vincent. Then it's off to Hollywood where he rapidly becomes one of the hottest producers in the movie business.\n\nUnfortunately, Michael has a hard time shaking his past. When he tries to buy the movie rights to a novel and is refused, he asks his old friend Tommy Povenzano for help. Tommy assures Michael the he will help. This is the start of all of Michael's problems.\n\nIn typical Woods fashion this novel is a mover. Though this novel isn't full of excitement, it will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next. It doesn't take long between incidents.\n\nThe bottom line here is that this is a book not to be missed.\n\nChoke \nDead In the Water\nOrchid Beach\n\nThese are all other options by Mr. Stuart and I would recommend any of them.\n\nThough this book has not won any awards Mr. Woods won the Edgar Alan Poe award in 1982 and was nominated again in 1992. Once you have read or listened to this book you will understand why.\n"

aS'\tThe solution to all educational problems\n\tCurrently, educational studies are being revealed, which are showing that students of minority heritage (particularly Black and Latino) have an affinity towards InterPersonal learning and Tactile learning\n\nInterpersonal = learning through being social and group work\n\nTactile = learning by building or constructing things\n\nOur current educational institutions, especially high school and below, cater to Auditory (hearing) and Intrapersonal (introverted, little group work) learners\n\nSo in total, poverty and language barriers are likely not the biggest culprit towards our low school scores, in areas of economic problems ----- rather, it is the fact that teachers are not teaching to the strengths of our children - as a matter of fact, most children are being taught within the areas of their learning weaknesses\n\nWith that in mind, FRAMES OF MIND is one of the first books to distiguish the way we learn and how to cater to it\n\nWithin this book lies the best solutions to our educational system, and its only a matter of getting the teachers to facilitate their lesson plans differently\n\nI highly recommend this book - especially to those who are interested in seeing what the future of America is all abou\n'

aS'\tOne of the few books to discuss what we can ALL learn from  the Cirque du Soleil creative process\n\tWhile this book had some minor flaws (I\'ll discuss those briefly later), it is worth owning, especially since it is one of the few books to truly discuss the creative process of Cirque Du Soleil and how the rest of us can learn from what the performers do every day- the type of risks they take in hopes of creating magic, the beauty and spiritual resonance of their performances.\n\nThere is another book out there that explores one man\'s experiences with one performer and it is also intriquing but this new book reveals more about a wider variety of artists, directors, designers, etc.\n\n\n    And, for all those who\'ve watched and been entranced by a Cirque du Soleil performance...wouldn\'t we all like to create a little of that magic in our lives? Wouldn\'t we all like to ignite our own creative fires, even if they come out in different ways, perhaps in writing, perhaps in our work lives or the time we spend with our families or while alone.  \n\n\n   One of the main lessons I got from this book is that being fully open as possible to one\'s imagination, hopes, dreams and aspirations can lead in wondrous directions and affect even the most "practical" or mundane tasks of life. It just takes the willingness to take the risk, to accept failure and setbacks in return for spiritual and emotional growth and lifechanging experiences. \n\n   This is more than a book geared to artists and peformers. It truly is for the rest of us. It can change your life. \n\n    Having said that, I found myself wanting more, felt myself not quite fully satisfied by this book. I felt some of the sections were a little too pat or formulaic. But these are minor quibbles when the book offers so much and is one of the few  books that really explores the Cirque du Soleil creative process. Until a better one comes along, I\'d consider this a MUST for anyone wanting to know more about the secrets and techniques of the Cirque du Soleil "spark", a spark that can affect us all.\n'

aS'\tTwo books in one! First covers networking. Second covers three types of small businesses and Internet marketing.\n\tWhat a wonderful book this author has written. It talks about developing interpersonal skills, public speaking skills, prospecting skills, networking etiquette, sales skills, marketing principles, and even customer service. It mentions the power of the Thank You note, and of giving more than you receive. It also devotes a chapter on some things about home-based businesses. And a chapter about the opportunities available through network marketing, and also a chapter on mail order and direct marketing as a business opportunity. I\'m not sure the mail order chapter should have been included. Quite frankly, I think the author should have written another book about what he discusses in chapters 12 to 14 instead of including those chapters here. And I think Chapter 15 should have been saved for its own book, and not included in this book either. But who cares! Anybody interested in the main thrust of the book (endless referrals) is going to be interested in chapters 12 to 15 - and they are well written and informative.\n\nWhat I liked the most about the book was the chapter summaries at the end of each chapter. I did not have to wade through the book the first time through. I just had to read the summaries. The other thing that was really nice about the book was the "recommended reading" sections at the end of chapters 12 through 15 and the one at the end of the book. Those booklists were very thorough and helpful. 5 stars\n'

aS"\tA much needed focus\n\t'Conservatives Without Conscience' does nothing less than expose the matrix of political illusion with a comprehensive framework of science.  There is much more that could be said about the authoritarian character structure and the history of the science, but John Dean does a good job of explaining the basics, and how it applies to our modern political landscape. \n\n\t This is not new information, it has just been sequestered in the hands of academics and the Carl Rove wing of the Republican party.  The academics keep measuring and refining their understanding, and Carl Rove and his party keeps using the information to manipulate the american public.  Finally, someone mainstream has laid it out for all to see.  Knowledge is power, so everyone should read his book.  However, one lesson to be learned from this book is that closed mindedness is a hallmark trait of the authoritarian character, so this is not a book written to convert anyone with strong authoritarian character traits.  They don't tend to read books much anyway.  It is a book  for the open minded, that will put into context our mean spirited political landscape,  the by any means necessary tactics of many named players, and the proto-fascist movement that has hijacked our country. \n\n\tJohn Dean pulls no punches.  He names names and kicks butt.  He gets a little dry when trying to define his wing of conservatism as opposed to neo conservatism, but even that is well worth the effort. \n If you have a shred of unease about the leaders of the Republican party and those who  unquestionably support them, then read this book.  It is an eye opener\n"

aS"\tA woman built the Brooklyn Bridge\n\tWhile the Brooklyn Bridge is the oldest of the bridges crossing the East River, it's one of the strongest, sturdiest and will most likely outlast the Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges. John Roebling and his son, Washington, did not know how the forces of nature and bridge loads would affect their bridge. Given this gap in their knowledge they overcompensated by building a bridge capable of withstanding forces many times greater than would ever be applied to their structure. \n\nBut the Roeblings' gaps in knowledge also worked against them. One of the most interesting portions of the book is where McCullough discusses the pressurized caissons beneath the East River where Washington Roebling and many his workers spent their time. Few doctors or engineers at the time knew how high pressure environments would affect the human body. The quick changes in pressure killed workers and left many, including Washington, with a condition known as the bends. Washington's wife, Emily, was forced to transform herself into chief engineer while Washington struggled with the bends.\n\nThere are lots of fascinating facts and tidbits throughout this book on the bridge and the people involved with its construction.   McCullough's book is much more about the politics and people behind Brooklyn Bridge rather than the engineering. I would have preferred to read more about the engineering techniques, but I  still found this book reasonably engaging.\n"

aS"\tLayered plot with plenty of twists and turns...\n\tIt's been awhile since I had a really good crime mystery read.  Therefore, I was excited when The Cold Moon by Jeffery Deaver arrived at the library.  The latest Lincoln Rhyme novel delivered just what I was looking for...  twists, turns, and plenty of forensic work.\n\nThe plotline here starts out on two tracks.  A killer nicknamed The Watchmaker is murdering people using slow torture techniques.  His signature is leaving a particular clock style at the scene. Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, his partner, are put on the case in order to solve it before more people die.  Sachs is also running her own case involving an apparent suicide that really turns out to be a murder.  The murder points to a run-down bar where a group of cops meet on a regular basis.  There's a strong chance that the cops are corrupt, so Sachs has to step carefully as it's not clear who she can trust.  The two cases converge when The Watchmaker is captured but the reality of his killings turn out to be a carefully staged plan to expose the corruption that Sachs is investigating.  But the layering of deception goes even deeper than that, and Rhyme has to continue to dig through each apparent motive and story to finally get to the core truth behind The Watchmaker...\n\nIf you want plot twists and turns, this book will definitely satisfy.  There are a number of scenes that appear to be transpiring in one fashion, only to be something else entirely.  The layering of plots by the killer never seems to end, and each new revelation ends up being the start of a new level of distraction.  A couple of the twists seemed to be a bit over the top, but not so much as to put me off the story.  It's a book I really didn't want to put down, even though I had other things I should be doing..\n"

aS"\tThe Law was not about truth. It was about negotiation, amelioration and manipulation.\n\tMichael Haller's life revolves around criminal defense, his an attorney operating out the back of his Lincoln town car. His appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy, people either called him Mick or Mickey. Tall, dark and Intelligent with his good looks and Irish blood lines made him a catch. In the court room he was very together with great timing, in his personal life it was a mess, at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter. His father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney; another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to, his father wrote books and practised law that didn't have room for innocent clients, so far Mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just wouldn't recognize innocence if it came along. Being an Independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll, he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who couldn't afford to pay his fees. In total he kept four Lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour, what he was really looking for was a franchise player, a case to keep the cash rolling, point blank a meal ticket. \n\nLouis Ross Roulet dealt in LA property he was a rich playboy, currently booked on charges of ag-assault, GBI, and attempted rape, and although his arrest charges looked bad these could always be dropped to something less by the time he made court. Mickey couldn't believe his luck not only a rich client but looking at the evidence it was stacked in favour to get him off the hook. This was all too easy, in fact with sharp tactics of negotiation and manipulation it was an open and shut case. Just as he was on a roll Mickey's close friend is murdered he begins to have second thoughts about his case something just didn't sit right, in his search for innocence had he instead stumbled upon something more sinister or maybe something just plain evil. \n\nThis is the first time in a long time that I have picked up a book based on a court room drama; but this book is much more than just that. Michael Connelly has done a wonderful job; his close collaboration with real life defense attorneys has paid off with their knowledge shining through; well written and easy to follow so you don't get lost in the jargon of law, especially for someone like me who is not familiar with the US law system. I'm hoping very much that Mr. Connelly will be able to entwine the exciting lawyer Mickey Haller in other books going forward, Congratulations to Michael Connelly for a rollercoaster read. \n\nA.Bowhil\n"

aS'\tSomewhat outdated, but still worth while\n\tMcNeill calls American Indians and Africans little more than the victims of the West in this book. He explains that they have little role in the development of culture (which he sees as passing from society to society from Mesopotamia on, like some sort of conceptual Olympic torch) and some get it and others do not. It is an outdated and bigoted way to see cultural history, and difficult to read without cringing. \n\nThat said, the book contains marvelous elements. Few writers will explain with his brevity and mastery how cultures have passed elements, one to another, over the expanse of time; few writers can convey the forward momentum of history as McNeil. So with all its faults, it is very worthy book, certainly worth reading while keeping in minds its somewhat dramatic shortcomings\n'

aS"\tWell-written book\n\tFor those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one, you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages.  Statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through.  The writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of China and its muscle power.  Instead of branding China as a villain, we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains, China wouldn't be where it is now.  Wal-Mart is covered in detail.  The writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing, it's only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when China has perfected its manufacturing bases just as Japan and South Korea had done before it.  Then, there's another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located, and how China is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour.  China's progress isn't simply detrimental to other countries.  On contrary, it benefits them as well.  For example, Australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to China.  With increase of living standard in China, Chinese needs more nutritious food.  As China couldn't provide enough, United States particularly the Middle States are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the Middle Kingdom.  Then, there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping United States in check by siding with China, and also the love and hate relationship between USA and China of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in China and so forth.  Whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided (since China has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time), suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks.  Yes, some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately, I think they are missing the points.  What's crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about China and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come.  Highly recommended\n"

aS"\tNice Intro but incomplete\n\tFirst, the strengths: Andrew gives intelligent summaries and discussion of some major historical film theorists, with chapters on Munsterberg, Arnheim, Eisenstein, Balazs, Kracauer, Bazin, Mitry, Metz, and Ayfre, and Agel. He focuses on the debate between the formalists (who believe film art is defined by its formal properties including editing, framing, mise-en-scene, lighting, and etc.) and the realist tradition (who believe that film art is defined by its basis in photography, a physical impression of its subject). The highlight is undoubtedly Andrew's excellent discussion of the great French critic Andre Bazin, which is not surprising since Andrew's Ph.D thesis was on Bazin. The weaknesses: This was published in 1976, and so it completely ignores the vast body of criticism published since then, especially feminism, and the influence of Lacan and psychoanalytic theory. Still, this is not a bad starting point for students of film theory\n"

aS'\tScarier than any Stephen King novel...\n\tYou want to read a horror story? This is it. This is the shameful way our government dealt with AIDS in the first six years it appeared in the country- by doing nothing at all.\n\nEVERYONE ignored it. The CDC, the NIH, the National Cancer Institute, it was ignored by everyone but a handful of scientists and doctors, and they were ignored too. Over 2000 gay men (and hemophiliacs, and straight people, and babies) died before the government even acknowleged that yes, something new was going around. Newspapers and media did not report this, because it was too embarrassing talking about how it was a "gay disease." Gay men didn\'t want to discuss that it "might" be spread through sex, and the ideas of shutting down the bathhouses and losing that little bit of hard-won liberation was unthinkable. Blood banks wouldn\'t even ACKNOWLEGE the fact that their products were contaminated, even after it was PROVEN that transfusion AIDS was possible and happening.\n\nBy the time President Reagan FIRST uttered the word AIDS, over 25,000 Americans were dead from the disease.\n\nThis book made me cry. The entire way through it, I wanted to scream, I wanted to throw things, I wanted to hit people until they realized that gay people deserve to live too. A university official that was denying AIDS researchers desperately needed funding had the nerve to actually remark, "Well, at least AIDS is getting rid of a lot of undesirable people." How absolutely disgusting. \n\nThis is a dauntingly large book- 621 pages of reading, all of it frustrating, angering, scream-inducing, and yet, still inspiring. They didn\'t give up. No one threw in the towel until their last breath, or until funding, sufficient funding, was finally granted. Sadly, the author himself died of AIDS in 1994. God bless everyone who worked so hard to make AIDS a household word, which finally happened, oh, about SEVEN STINKING YEARS after it first started killing people in the US. What the heck is wrong with this country? Why did people have their heads in the sand for so long? What\'s so stinking WRONG with us?\n\nAnother book everyone should read, if only to know how our government helped spread AIDS around the world by ignoring it for six damn years. How many people did they kill by doing that? Far, far too many. We were the last civilized nation to institute an AIDS education/prevention program. This book made me dislike the bureaucracy of this country even more, and I didn\'t think that was possible.\n\nGod bless everyone who is working to make life better for people with AIDS\n'

aS'\tBye-bye to Barty #8217;s biting back-chat\n\tIt #8217;s been two years since the recovery of The Amulet of Samarkand, and Nathaniel (now known as John Mandrake) is a Government official in the Office of Internal Affairs, apprenticed to Jessica Whitwell.\n\nHis job is to hunt down a pack of rebellious commoners known as the Resistance, who have been causing a series of disturbances in London, aiming to destabilize the rule of the magicians.  He suspects the involvement of a girl named Kitty and her friends whom we met in his previous adventure, and although correct in this assumption, it soon becomes obvious that there is deeper evil afoot, as a destructive force hidden in a black cloud begins attacking the city, destroying buildings and magical artifacts as it goes.\n\nWhen things start spiraling out of control, he is forced to call upon Bartimaeus again for help, and the adventure spirals into a saga of grave robbery, political maneuvers, foreign travel and ancient magic.\n\nThough certainly not as good as the first, and a little too long, The Golem #8217;s Eye makes for good reading, but is sadly lacking the sarcastic witticisms of everyone #8217;s favorite djinn that were the high point of book one.\n\nAmanda Richards, May 20, 2006\n'

aS'\tA better title might be: "A Truly Great American\'s Life"\n\tAs one of America\'s greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan will certainly be studied by historians for years to come and, like Abraham Lincoln he will likely be revered and discussed by people of all nationalities for many generations.  This book and his earlier autobiography, Where\'s the Rest of Me, will surely be the touch stones for any such inquiries and discussions.  This work, An American Life, however, will be of primary importance since it addresses his entire life and political career rather than simply the earlier part of his life, during which time he was primarily a sportscaster and actor.  For anyone who had the pleasure of listening to Reagan\'s political commentaries on the radio, or hearing him speak as Governor of California or as President of the United States, the book will be particularly enjoyable; for it is written in the easy-going conversational style that Reagan used in life.  What makes the book even more interesting is that you can not only catch a glimpse of the country into which Ronald Reagan was born but also see how that country was transformed into the nation as we know it today.  You may also observe that the problems of Reagan\'s day are not much different than those we face today.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand Ronald Reagan, how his many faceted character was formed, the inner workings of his mind, and the actions which led to his monumental achievements.  In my view, it would benefit the country greatly if this book was made to be required reading for every American child.\n'

Nothing annoys me more than a poor or monotoned reader or one who places inflections in inappropriate places, like news readers.  I loved the sound effects coupled with an excellent reader and the two added to the experience of listening to this book.  I also liked that the story was partly done in first person.  The main character initially doesn't seem to have much to offer the world.....\n\nAnyway, there are others who have diagramed the story, I just wanted to say, I enjoyed it and the way it was presented in audio version.\n"

aS'\talways amazing and intriguing\n\tFor those of you who might find the first Found book or this second one offensive in its content -- guess what? -- life is offensive. And for that matter, life is also often tragic, poignant, ironic, hysterically funny, random, and sometimes all of these things at once... the "Found" books and the magazines reflect all of these aspects of everyday life. That\'s what makes it so remarkable. Indeed, how many books can cause you to giggle and feel emotionally vulnerable within two pages? This work by Davy Rothbart, co-editor Jason Bitner, and all the Found crew deserves praise because this is a cross-section of humanity stripped down to its beautiful bare essentials. If, several thousand years from now, (android? zombie?) archeologists study our current century, they might go through our trash. Think of "Found" as giving them a headstart.\n'

Someone with some morals and a love of our country. She has neither. It is an important "first" that should withstand the test of time. Historians are going to have a field day writing all the trash these two are involved in. \n\nHer mothering skills reveal a great deal about her character. Her child was always placed last. The only time Hillary showed any family unity was when it was necessary for the media to put her in a positive light.\n\nHow did these two gain so much wealth in such a short amount of time?  They did not even own property when "they" became president.  There are still a lot of questions to be answered, and many more books to be written about this family. \n\n8 years of these two is quite enough.\n'

On the good side he defeated the British at the amazing Battle of New Orleans, help in expanding into the West, a great soldier, clearly loved his wife Rachel enough to duel to defend her, and was probably the only president who could threaten a state with military force if it tried to leave the Union and tough enough to make it happen. On the flip side his percusion of Indians, the Trail of Tears, his many duels makes him a very complex and sometimes hard to understand person. But still a great biography\n"

aS'\tThe Elements of Style: A Classic with Timeless Advice\n\tAlthough the original Elements of Style was written in 1919 (or earlier), it still holds true that anyone who wants to learn how to write in a clear and concise manner will benefit from this book. After reading this book you\'ll know to avoid breaking elementary rules and principles that are made in writing: excessive  use of adjectives and adverbs, writing in the passive voice, using different tenses in writing, using the improper case of pronouns (example: using "who" when "whom" should be used and vice versa). \n\nOne of the most important things that the writer stands to gain from this book is an improvement in his writing style. After reading this book, you will know how to write in a way that comes naturally, write with nouns and pronouns (not superfluous adverbs and adjectives), write and then rewrite, but do not overwrite and overstate, use orthodox spelling, do not explain too much, avoid fancy words, be clear, do not inject opinions, use figures of speech sparingly, and countless other helpful techniques.  \n\nTo say that this book should be required reading for all writers is an understatement.

aS"\t48 LAWS OF POWER:  My Son's Evaluation\n\tMy son (34) is currently incarcerated.  He asked for this book so I had it sent to him.

He raved so much, he insisted I order one for myself.  I did.  In summary, what I derived from the reading was one must be callous in this life and put yourself first.  Otherwise, you'll be no more than a stepping stone for others.  It's a good book but I oftentimes got lost in all its references to those that preceded us by 500-600 years.

aS'\tLeaders Are Not Born But Made--It Begins Here!!\n\tIt\'s an easy read and can be applied immediately to you situation. The book brings the basics of leadership traits and principles to the reader similar to the military leadership books I\'ve read in the USMC. So many times have I held jobs where a manager, although excellent in managing projects, through some lack of sensitity or judgement created an uproar that cause moral to fall and people to become resentful and leave. There are many stories in the press of managers and CEOs restricting "bathroom breaks", playing favorites, freezing wages and laying off employees while taking huge "bonuses" like American Airlines and ENRON. What\'s present here is basic but essential information for anyone in a leadership roll whether at work, church functions, or managing a family trip. This should be required reading for everyone BEFORE you find yourself in a situation as leader. The boss could be out for a whole month  tommorrow.

aS"\tOf Paradise and Power : America and Europe in the New World Order\n\tGood, high-level analysis of current US vs European international relations written from a conservative perspective.   As with any book covering fluid world events this book can only provide a snapshot, circa 2000-04, of those events.  But there are two significant underlying assumption in this book: \n\nFirst, as the single greatest world power, the US will project its power for decades in any region of the world it feels has long-term impact to its strategic goals, such as Europe throughout the entire Cold War, Southeast Asia in the 60's   70's and in the Middle East today.  \n\nSecond, US historically has viewed itself as the proponent of the spread of liberal democracy through out the world.  \n\nRather than focusing on the snipping back and forth between the US   Europe, the two major assumptions of this book could serve as a litmus test to observe how current US foreign policy in the Middle East plays itself out over the next few decades.  Is it merely a current political view or a historic shift in strategic focus to a different region of the world? Stay tuned.\n\nIt is a well-written, quick read with meaningful subcontextual insights.\n"

aS"\t--Powerful and Unforgettable--\n\tGODS AND GENERALS is an extremely well done and fascinating book.  The author, Jeff Shaara, did an excellent job of interpreting the characters. His task was a difficult one because his father's book, THE KILLER ANGELS is a classic in the chronicles of Civil War stories.  This book precedes the one written by his father. \n\nGODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to the beginning of the Civil War and through many of the battles. The major players in the story are Winfield Scott, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Winfield Hancock and Lawrence Chamberlain.  The career biographies of these famous men were striking.  After reading of their early lives and service experiences, it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the Union Army. They were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends.\n\nI listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by Dick Estell.  He brought the characters to life by his narration. This book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history.\n"

aS'\tExcellent!\n\tAfter reading a book of Sandra Brown\'s that I horribly disliked, I was hesitant to give her another shot. I\'m truly glad I did; The Witness was a first-rate thriller!\n\nThe villains in this book are greasy, sick individuals that rather turned my stomach...just what you like when you want to get a taste of Why A Person Would Run For Their Life! Sandra Brown wrote these characters (and that of Ricki Sue-who I could easily picture!) particularly well. The baby was truly the icing on the cake: this infant motivated Kendall throughout the book and, like any mother, lived for the love of her child.\n\nI also loved the sexy, romantic element here-it was just enough that it didn\'t overwhelm the story...even better, it didn\'t change Kendall into a mindless goober (a state which many female characters in "romance" novels often achieve.)\n\nThe Witness succeeded on so many levels yet fell short of a full five-star rating. Perhaps it was the Crooks...they came off a bit cliche, but were still necessary characters.\n\nStill, this book is an excellent, thought-provoking choice with a WOW ending. Very enjoyable\n'

aS'\tComprehensive, clear, practical\n\tWhile not written at the level of technical philosophical detail as Aquinas or Pannenberg (as another review here stresses), this text is still set apart from most general theological treatments by its philosophical clarity and coherence.  This is in addition to the virtues of its serious treatment of the range of Scriptural data concerning each topic, its apologetic engagement with differing views, and its practical counsel for life and ministry.  It is a great resource for thinking through major theological issues and positions.  I recommend it highly\n'

aS"\tA likeable conclusion to the trilogy!\n\tBook number three in the Outlander trilogy, the fantasy historical romance of the time traveling Claire Fraser, has Claire re-unite with her 18th century husband, Jamie, who she left before the battle of Culloden in Dragonfly in Amber.  A time travel trip through the stones is once more necessary and Claire has to leave her beloved daughter Brianna behind. \n\nThis trip is successful and Claire is now plunged into the complicated life of Jamie, who has survived the battle but now is dealing with the post-uprising difficulties of the Scottish.  While Claire is involved with the difficulties of her re-union with Jamie, there is also a series of mysterious and violent murders in Edinborough, and the kidnapping of Jamie's nephew.  Claire and Jamie sail the high seas and encounter pirates, voodoo and slave uprisings in the Caribbean.\n\nThis colorful third installment in the series at times seems like it tries a little too hard to have Claire and Jamie caught up in every possible adventure of the time period.  Nevertheless the foundation of the solid characters created and nurtured by Gabaldan weather the slightly torrid escapades of this timeless romantic couple.  One of the new characters is a bit flimsy and caricatured; the giggling, bouncy, foot-worshipping Chinaman Mr. Willoughby.  Although he later proves to be more substantial than his intial portrayal, the appearance of this character is contrived and jarring.  A note I think the story would have been better without.   \n\nDespite its flaws, Voyager continues the thread of a passionate romance and fascinating premise.  The time travel fantasy is portrayed well--in particular the notion of what one would bring back to the 18th century if all you could carry was in your pockets.  Combining historical romance and fantasy was a genius stroke that makes this series of continuing interest.  Gabaldon's superior narrative, likeable characters and excellent research continue and keep her audience hooked.  In light of the inherent difficulty of maintaining reader interest in a character and premise over three books, this is a highly sucessful sequel.\n"

aS"\tInsightful and possibly life-saving\n\tThe insights here are simple, straightforward and profound. It explains how modern society can sometimes put men into a no-win situation, resulting in a feeling of frustration, impotence, incompetence, and depression. The only socially acceptable way to express it is rage (even though rage is vilified, I can tell you that showing hurt, pain and weakness invites scorn, distain and disrespect, even from those who purport to love us). \nBy explaining how we get into this trap, it helps us to understand it and thus gives us a chance to find a way out. I wish I could give a copy of this book to every man and woman in the world. I see so much of it played out every day all around us, and the pain both men and women feel because of it does so much damage. Read it before you have a crisis if you can, but if you are already in crisis, make the effort to read this book even if you can't read anything else. It might even save your life. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.\n"

aS"\tA Hardboiled Gem!\n\tThe late Ed McBain left all mystery buffs a lasting legacy with his 87th Precinct novels but a worthy addition to this legacy is The Gutter And The Grave. Written in 1958, this hardboiled gem has been all but forgotten. But thanks to Hard Case Crime, a new generation can experience this incredible early work from one of the all-time masters. \n\nThe hero, Cordell, is as tragic and harboiled as they come as he, soaked in cheap booze, wallows in the memory of an unfaithful wife. Until a favor for a friend draws him into a web of murder and deception. It seems everyone is lying and each lie twists the tail in new directions, leaving the reader's head spinning. The novel features McBain's usually excellent dialogue, the setting is well-drawn featuring the jazz scene in 1950's New York. There's humor, pathos, some great fights and enough broken dreams to fill Broadway. \n\nThis little gem of a novel has been unavailable for far too long. I give it my highest recommendation. Fantastic!\n"

aS"\tTop notch SF\n\tI was surprised at some of the poor reviews given this book and have an idea that these stem from those picking up books from a list of Nebula Award winners. This book is not at all your typical SF story, indeed it feels much more like a mainstream story with some SF aspects than it does an SF story. I'm an avid reader of both science fiction as well as mainstream fiction, so this holds a good deal of appeal for me.\n\nGriffith's prose is wonderful and showcases a beauty of language seldom seen in science fiction. Her characterization is also near perfect. I won't spend time discussing the plot as that's been handled amply by the other reviewers, but I will echo one other person's thoughts: The storyline that has Lore working at a sewage plant is, surprisingly, every bit as engrossing as the ones that deal with her kidnapping and her high society upbringing. To me, that says a good deal about Griffith's talent as a writer.\n\nAs for the sex scenes, which some people describe as being nearly constant in the book, there are actually about four or five scenes taking up somewhere around ten pages of the book (not each, but in total). Additionally, they're not placed in the story without purpose.\n\nOverall, an excellent book. Personally, I'm quite glad that it won a Nebula. It's certainly desereving\n"

aS"\tA must read\n\tThe first book in NR's 'Born In' series is wonderful, you don't want to miss it!   quot;Born In Fire quot; focuses on Maggie Concannon, a tempermental and loyal woman who is also a gifted artist. Gallery owner Rogan Sweeney takes an interest in Maggie's fabulous glass creations, and soon after takes a personal interest in Maggie herself.  Maggie is a wonderful character, stubborn and flawed, yet still caring.  Nora does a fabulous job of developing Maggie, and does it in a way that she seems like a real person.  Rogan is an extremely likeable hero.  Maggie's sister, Brianna, is her complete opposite; quiet, sweet, and calm.  The relationship between the two sisters, however, is very touching and very real.  This book is full of colourful characters, some we love and some we hate.  The romance between Rogan and Maggie is wonderful.  Basically, I just can't say enough good things about this book.  You will love it\n"

I highly recommend this cookbook to vegans, vegetarians, people allergic to dairy and wheat, and meat eaters, as well\n'

aS"\tChanged my Life\n\tI evolved into a lower carb nutrition by finding first that I needed more protein than I had thought and that I reacted strongly to sugars.  I bought this book when I decided to lose a few pounds, but wanted to understand any health implications related to a low carb diet.  I was already having gall bladder and liver issues.  I bought this book first and 2.5 years later, it is still the best reference I have.  The chapter on hormones is a bit technical, but this chapter alone is worth the price of the book.  \n\nWithin three days of eliminating grains from my diet, I no longer cared whether or not I lost weight.  My awful blood sugar drops and painful bloating were gone, my energy increased significantly and within weeks I noticed that the gall bladder pain was gone (and it hasn't come back).  Within three months my intense hot flashes disappeared and I started sleeping better.  \n\nThe book first describes what low carb nutrition is, then goes on to discuss hormones and how insulin impacts the overall balance of the body's hormones in different ways.  It addresses overall energy, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, gastrointestinal disorders, vitamins and minerals, and weight control (one chapter - the rest is on health issues).\n"

aS'\tGlobal Capitalism\'s Local Disaster\n\tThere are many books out there about the supposed strengths or weaknesses of globalization and free trade, but at least in terms of the international movement of capital, you\'ll usually find mere boosterism and ideology. At last, Paul Blustein has given us a look at the real-life effects of financial shenanigans and speculation on the lives of real people in a developing nation. Here we have an in-depth and incredibly informative examination of the global financial trends that led to the horrendous collapse of Argentina\'s economy in 2001-2002, which resulted in millions and millions of people descending into poverty and hardship. You won\'t be surprised to see the word "bubble" regularly, as Blustein covers the surprisingly slow-moving factors that added up to disaster over several years, with many mistakes made by all parties along the way. \n\nIn addition to some financial mismanagement and damaging internal politics within Argentina itself, Blustein also explains errors made by the IMF and the Clinton and Bush administrations, and unhealthy speculation by foreign investors who had no regard for the outcomes of their actions. Not to mention, Argentina was the punching bag for an international monetary system that is built to ensure short-term rewards for speculators, plus an ideology that believes it to be acceptable when elites in rich countries profit while regular people in developing nations are left holding the bag when the bubble bursts. I would also recommend this book for those with a general interest in international monetary matters, as Bluestein does a marvelous job explaining phenomena like currency exchange rates, international debt and equity markets, and other financial concepts that you may wish to understand more deeply. If you\'re an ideologue in love with the supposed panacea of free markets, thinking that the unfettered movement of capital around the world will raise all ships, you might have your worldview shot down by Blustein and his excellent look at Argentina\'s misery.

aS"\tPerfect intoduction for the curious\n\tOnly about two hundred pages, Jonathan Spence does a very noble job summarizing one of the most powerful, mysterious, fascinating, and frightening persons of the twentieth century.  Though if one is looking for a book that goes into detail about any aspect of Mao's life or policies, it is best to look elsewhere.  This book is a straightforward and unabashed introduction and quick overview of Mao's life and work and ideas.  Perfect for people curious about Mao and twentieth century China who want to read more than an abstract, but do not necessarily need or want to tackle a big and detailed work.  Just the facts and little commentary.  Spence does a good job balancing any bias against or for Mao and his policies and deals mostly with the reasons for them and overall consequences\n"

aS'\t"I was cut out for finer things."\n\tThe narrator of Joe Perrotta\'s novel "Joe College" is Danny, an English major at Yale. Stuck with the peculiarities of his roommates, and with a horrendous crush on a fellow student named Polly, Danny struggles to complete his junior year. While home in New Jersey on a summer break, Danny drives his father\'s lunch wagon "The Roach Coach." And this is how he meets Cindy, a pleasant, chatty secretary. Danny compares her to the girls on the Yale campus, and the comparison is not flattering to Cindy. He\'s faintly embarrassed by her, and while she\'s ok to date when he\'s home in New Jersey, he\'s ashamed of the relationship when he returns to Yale.\n\nOnce again, Perrotta presents the theme of escape from New Jersey, and in the novel, Danny\'s escape is temporarily through Yale, but ultimately through education. Cindy represents everything Danny is trying to escape--a lifetime driving the Roach Coach, and Danny knows far too many people who made huge mistakes and ended up trapped forever in New Jersey. \n\nClass is another theme in the novel--during the school year, Danny works in a cafeteria. The employees and the Townies are all too well aware that their lives are mapped out--whereas the Yale students seem to have vast, limitless opportunities. While Danny\'s background is humble, and his parents have made tremendous sacrifices to send him to Yale, he rubs shoulders with peers who come from incredibly wealthy homes. To them, Yale doesn\'t quite hold the desperate stakes that face Danny. When it comes to making some rather questionable moral choices, Danny nakedly examines his motives, and simply shrugs. While this does not make Danny a heroic narrator, it certainly makes him very real and very human. As a Perrotta fan, I hope that the author rediscovers Danny in another novel. In "Joe College" Danny\'s moral fibre is still quite plastic, and he may prove to be fascinating in middle age--displacedhuma\n'

aS'\tWho knew that earth demons like Chef Boyardee?\n\t\'The Regulators\' is not quite on the literary level of \'Desperation,\' but that makes it more fun in a way, especially as it\'s less preachy.  I liked that \'The Regulators\' adds a little more information about the mysterious Tak.  Here we see a more terribly playful, oddly fastidious, and possibly younger Tak who loves spaghetti, chocolate milk, westerns, and Cassie Stiles.  And while most of the characters of \'The Regulators\' are flatter than those of \'Desperation,\' \'The Regulators\' gives us a glimpse of what some inhabitants of Desperation might have been like before Tak possessed them, particularly Audrey and Collie who were never shown "pre-Tak" in \'Desperation.\n'

aS"\ta necessity and a work of pure genius\n\tas soon as people see breton's name on a book, they immediately feel indignation and privately exclaim,  quot;the dictator of surrealism! quot; what they don't seem to realize is that, despite being a flawed and somewhat ambivalent man, he probably had more passion in his pinky than they do in their entire body.  quot;nadja quot; is simply one more delightful proof of breton's genius and his infallible flair for the surreal, the mysterious, the mystical, and everything that is profoundly divergent. in this tale of intrigue and obsession he travels the streets of paris with a ghostly, clearly insane young woman who calls herself nadja, which is the russian word for hope.  the most captivating parts of the novel are the bizarre and surreal conversations he has with her. even though he found her incredibly fascinating and almost an ethereal enigma, things start to turn sour between them and breton grows bored with her.  at the end of the novel, nadja is put into an asylum after the police are called because of her incessant screaming and apparently incoherent behavior, some of which suggested that she was living in a world of hallucinations and irrational fears.  we do know that nadja was a real woman and not by means some fictitious creation of breton's, and we also know that she came to a somewhat unfortunate end. it may be true that breton's behavior and attitude of indifference and deliberate ignorance about her truly wretched fate (she died of cancer, insane and completely alone) is indeed nothing to admire, but those who put too much emphasis on this admittedly accurate fact forget that while he may in a sense have betrayed her, he also made a truly admirable effort to make the world see nadja and those like her as no one has seen them before, and immortalized her in a book that is absolutely unforgettable and breathtakingly beautiful. breton was a profoundly hopeful and truly revolutionary figure who exhorted humanity, even while the second world war raged and reaped it's devastating results universally on all of mankind, to recognize the miraculous and wondrous nature of our very existence, however 'absurd' or meaningless some felt it to be after the horrendous events of the twentieth century. it is true that he occasionally goes over the top with his optimism, but his iron will and determination to fight 'miserabilism', the philosophical justification of human misery, at all costs can only call forth our admiration. his exaltation of the imagination as the highest of human faculties and the sole organ of man that will allow him to attain felicity seems to be verified by direct, concrete experience of life.  as we grow older and we come to realize that sensual pleasure is a big part of life but essentially empty and hollow, our inner lives (hopefully) become more vivid and we end up spending more and more time there. breton knows this and wants us to cultivate it to the highest degree possible. don't be fooled by the 'anti breton' rhetoric and take a dismissive attitude toward him, because you'll be missing out on some of the most fascinating books (to my mind) ever written\n"

aS'\tAdventures of Huckleberry Finn- A Racial Controversy\n\tThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been argued as a racial controversy since the first day it was published. Shortly after it was accessible to the public, multiple committees banned the book, proclaiming it to be racist and "trash". To this day, Mark Twain\'s Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is banned in several school districts. \n\nIn my personal copy of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, there is a helpful and informative introduction and notes throughout the text written by Robert O\'Meally. He clearly states that the intent of Twain\'s word usage is needed in order to properly and vividly describe the setting and tone of the book. His usage of the racial slur "nigger" can be seen as offensive, but I believe it was necessary for it to be realistic. The dialogue that Huckleberry uses throughout the book stays very true to his character, time, and place, at which the slur was used casually. \n\nBesides the usage of the word "nigger", characters in the book often loudly express their racist mentality.  In the begining of Chapter 14, Huck and Jim are talking about all sorts of topics, both of them speaking their mind. Twain describes Huck\'s thoughts: "Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger." Obviously some would perceive this to be intolerable and crude, yet I believe that Twain is simply describing the way Huck thinks of Jim. The growing friendship between Huck and Jim is the basis of the entire novel. The book depicts the way Huck feels and thinks about several ideas and concepts about life, the way he feels about his friend must be present and elaborate.\n\nI strongly support Mark Twain\'s the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book wins people over with it \'s dialogue, plot, originality, and capability to express a realistic story that takes place in a racist and unjust America.\n'

aS'\tWow - my ears are opened!\n\tI just got a book out of the library.  The author is a nut about recording songs and analyzing the sonograms (frequency intensity over time), and in his mind, when he hears a song, he identifies it by how it "looks" in his mental sonogram.\n\nThis whole idea is amazing, and I think I\'ll never listen to birds the same way again - just after reading the first few pages!\n\nThe writing style pulls you into the author\'s world as he tracks birds and ponders the meaning of their song.  If you love birding, you will wish you had been there on every walk, and you\'ll want to wake up two hours before dawn the next day to discover the amazingly different pre-dawn songs of common birds.\n\nThe book comes with as CD with 98 tracks of songs, and some of the tracks are slowed down, which really changes your perception and shows you the depth and richness of some of those "blurt" sounds birds make.  The Woodthrush  at 1/10 speed reminds me of a howling wolf.  I know I\'ll never listed to this song the same way again\n'

aS'\tPhotographer as Artist\n\tGeorge DeWolfe sees the photographer as an artist, not a technician, yet his book provides the technical knowledge and shows how to use Photoshop to create consistently high quality fine art prints.  Writing for the experienced photographer with a basic knowledge of Photoshop, DeWolfe begins by showing the photographer, with many examples, how to evaluate an image and decide what adjustments will bring out its special qualities.  The experienced photographer has always used his or her understanding of how light, luminosity and color give life to an image, and has traditionally used various techniques in the darkroom to enhance them.  DeWolfe begins by training the eye of the artist to see these elements and understand how they work.  After showing the reader how to truly see the image and decide how to fine-tune it, DeWolfe then gives us a very detailed digital workflow which, once mastered, allows the photographer to produce excellent prints on a consistent basis. The workflow is clarified by many screen shots showing Photoshop techniques and before/after image adjustments. Those who think visually will find these particularly helpful.\n\nDeWolfe\'s approach is to use the simplest techniques that can produce consistently fine results.  (Some Photoshop users will be surprised by his use of the history brush instead of masking; as a photographer who uses this tool, I appreciate its simplicity and controlled results.)  His focus is not on "tips-and-tricks in Photoshop", but on how to get the best possible prints in the simplest, most straightforward way.  While a first reading gives valuable insights, the book\'s true value becomes evident when the photographer uses the workflow on his or her own images, and practices to become proficient.  The proof, as they say, is in the print\n'

It has also triggered a renewed interest in the children for using their own imaginations to create stories of their own creation. I am ordering a copy for our own personal library.

aS"\tThe Death of the Devastators\n\tMany people remember the battle of Midway as the turning point of the war in the Pacific due to the sinking of four Japanese aircraft carriers, and rightly so.  But would the American success at Midway been possible without the heroic actions of their torpedo squadrons?  Probably not.  In this eye-opening account of the battle, author Alvin Kernan sheds much new light on these intrepid airmen who, flying obsoloete aircraft and using defective torpedoes, cleared the way for the SBD Dauntlesses to deliver the crushing blows on the Japanese carriers.\n\nAfter sighting the enemy carriers, the three American flattops began launching their torpedo bombers, dive bombers, and fighters in the hopes of making a coordinated attack on the Japanese fleet.  However, while en route to the target, almost all of the squadrons became separated and the USS Hornet's contingent of fighters and dive bombers never even made it to the Japanese fleet. Its aircraft either returned to the carrier or ditched in the sea.  Meanwhile, ,the planes from USS Yorktown and USS Enterprise were not able to coordinate their attacks.  Thus, the torpedo planes attacked without fighter protection.\n\nThese planes were thrown into a virtual meat grinder of anti aircraft fire and pursuit from Japanese fighters.  Out of a compliment of 51 planes, 44 were shot down.  One man, Ensign George Gay, survived from Torpedo squadron 8.  Not a single American torpedo hit the Japanese fleet.  However, this sacrifice was not in vain, for a few minutes later, the SBDs found the Japanese and in the span of a few minutes sent three Japanese carriers to the bottom.  The fourth followed later in the day.\n\nThe author brings up some interesting points in the book.  For example, he mentions the confusing flight plan of the Hornet's commander Ring, who, for some reason, chose to fly a course which would take him well north of the Japanese fleet.  He then failed to write an after action report upon returning to the Hornet.  The author also describes the inferiority of the American aircraft, specifically, there extremely limited range which, in the end, caused the American fighters to turn back.  Also, the fighters that did make it to the Japanese fleet never flew down to help out the lumbering Devastators.  In all intents and purposes, the SBDs happened to end up in the right place at precisely the right time.  If they had not, the battle could have turned out much differently.\n\nThis is a fascinating book.  I've read several books about the battle of Midway, but none have went into the depth of exploring the destruction of the torpedo planes as this one does.  The writer, a former member of the Enterprise's air group, describes the battle as only a true eyewitness could.  He raises some alarming quetions which I had never thought about before reading this book.  Although the book itself is somewhat short, it does a masterful job of covering the plight of the torpedo planes.\n\nI highly recommend this fine book.  If you've read anything previously about the battle of Midway, you must read this book.  It sheds some new light on the heroic sacrifice of the American torpedo squadrons and how their actions paved the way for the American victory\n"

My nearly 2 year old demands poems from it all the time (as only 2 year olds can demand!!) and her older brothers have also enjoyed them.  The book has so many poems that struck a chord with us; just one small example: With recent cold weather I ended up sharing Dragon Smoke (about day being so cold you can see your own breath) with my oldest son\'s class at school. I have also suggested that our local pre-school buys a copy for the adult library so that the poems can be shared with the children when relevant themes / moments arise.  The pictures are perfect for the poems creating a completely wonderful package. It is just an absolutely superb book and one I will be buying as a present for many other families.  I think in a way the title is a bit of a pity, (although completly reasonable), as these poems will last a lot longer than just for the "very Young"\n'

aS'\tLight into darkness\n\t"Lords of the Earth" is the term the Yali warriors use to describe themselves.  They live in the Heluk valley in Irian Jaya, and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains.  The first section of the book is about them, their customs, and the awful fear and darkness they lived in.  Don Richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin, and longing for release.  The horror of their pain is graphic, and not suitable to be read to younger children.  \n\nThe second part of the book describes the early life of Stan Dale, his conversion, and his burden for those in darkness.  He is drawn as a determined man, physically strong and fit, with firm convictions.  \n\nThe book goes on to tell of Stan\'s coming to the Yali people.  How a strange story begins over his identity, protecting his life.  How the first few Yali Christians were killed, and later Stan and a fellow missionary were brutally murdered.  How another missionary family died in a plane crash, except for the nine-year-old son, whose friendship with the Yali paves the way for them to turn to Christ.  \n\nThe book reminded me Christ\'s words in John 12:24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."  On earth, Stan Dale never saw the fruit his life and death brought forth, but he will rejoice in heaven with the Yali that are there through his witness.\n'

aS'\tWar and Peace: Both Inscrutable\n\tReading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking, which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human. The first time that I read it, I read it as a novel, for entertainment. Years later, I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious. I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man.  During this second reading, I was able to examine the Russian names, characters, events, and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through. What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog, which I scanted then but studied now. Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going, which it certainly is, but in it, Tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do. In essence, each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space, with one atom colliding at random with another, but when a sufficient number act in concert, such as Napoleon\'s invasion of Russia, their force is irresistable. When Tolstoy introduces world leaders like Napoleon or the Tsar, he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom, who can not see the Big Picture any more clearly than anyone else can.  The tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change.  But when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self-deluding--as when General Kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms, then they are drawing closer to a universal "one" with nature.  This "one" Tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with God. Tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that "one" or any other deity, but he does say that history, time, and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path, and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go, then he might wish to emulate General Kutuzov, who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going.\n'

Dr. Streicher\'s book helped educate my mother so that she was an informed patient and knew what questions to ask her own doctor.  Fortunately, it was determined that my mother did not need to have a hyesterectomy.  My only problem with this book is getting my copy back from my mother.  I may need to purchase a new one.

Once you read this you must also read Raising Demons, which is the sequel, and every bit as good, although much harder to find\n"

From types of attacks, to algorithm security to security in the context of your data center, you get a full overview of the current practices and consequences arising from them. The author argues for security as a process, not a product; security is not something you can add to your product after the fact. Starting from the product specification, down to your last outsourced programmer, security has to permeate your organization for it to work. Building 'attack trees', relying on peer review and enforcing liability are all suggestions advanced by Bruce Schneier. \n\nSecrets and Lies is a well organized book with plenty of real world examples, problems and solutions. Buy a copy for yourself, and many more for everybody else you know, we will all benefit in the end.\n"

aS'\tA Fresh New Look about an Old Topic\n\tFor those who love historical texts, but sometimes have a hard time weeding thru the period language, overly technical jargon and miles of microfiche, this book is a real blessing. The author not only deals with the methods of tracking, chasing and boarding prey, but goes happily in-depth about the people who follow the "sweet trade". He covers the buccaneer lifestyle on land as well as at sea, the events leading up to their rise in influence in the Caribbean, and goes into clothing, food, religion, heirarchy, weapons, flags,choice of ships and cultural relationships.\nI picked up this book primarily to confirm or disprove my theories on individual weapons combat during boarding actions and while the techniques are not played up in any great detail,citing the use of powder and grenades over cutlass and knife, the reasonings behind what weapons were used and how unorthodox hand to hand combat could be in closed quarters are sound.\nOverall a very enjoyable and informative book!\n\nGareth Thomas\nDirector; Historical Maritime Combat Associatio\n'

aS"\tWell illustrated and explained.\n\tIf you are just starting out on photography, I highly recommend this book. It begins immediately on the first chapter on picture making! For this reason alone, I would give it 5 stars. Here in the first chapter, the authors wasted no time to tell you what makes good pictures: the photographer, not the equipment. They then proceed to explain why the majority of our pictures (at least, the rest of us non-professionals) turn out unflattering despite our best efforts and high-tech cameras. \n\nIf you read nothing else but the first chapter alone, I would bet that your photography will already begin to improve. Or if not, the first chapter will at least inspire you to try the suggestions and see the result yourself. In fact, even if all you have is a humble point and shoot film camera, the things they teach in the first chapter are still totally valid, as the principles of good photography remains the same whether you use film or digital.\n\nThe next chapters give details about camera operations, how to creatively use camera controls, and another great topic, how to tackle different photographic subjects. Just what I needed! I like the chapter on how to process you own film in black and white. Although I'll probably not dive into it, this chapter gives you good grounding on the grassroots of photography.\n\nOther good stuff inside:\n\n1. Projects at the end of most every chapter. I dare you to do all the project at chapter one and tell me if it will not improve your understanding of what makes a good picture!\n\n2. Information on digital aspect of photography. Although I shoot film slr, I know that one day, I'll want a digital slr so the info on it is nice.\n\n3. All the illustative pictures are ones that can be done by amateurs! In keeping with the beginner's purpose, this is intentional on the part of the authors. If you are looking for award winning photos or famous photographers, you wont find it here. But the pictures in the book are beautiful in their own right and they drive home the points taught. \n\n4. Modest studio lighting you can create yourself! The principles on the very important aspect of light taught here are very revealing to me. The diagram of how to photograph a subject using only your own flash and any old white card to reflect some light is already a good starting point.\n\nHowever, I am tempted to give this book 4 stars since I felt that despite it's generous information, attractive layout, highly readable text, and wide pages, the authors skimmed the topic on tricky exposure problems. The use of grey cards, spotmeters, and handheld lightmeters to solve these tough light problems were only briefly explained. On the other hand, they provided easily applied solutions to our most common exposure problems. So I give them the benefit of the doubt that such issues correctly belong to advanced photography topics which might only discourage the wobbly beginner if mentioned here. Now that you are aware of it, you will probably do more research on it. Meanwhile, a lot of my pictures are already much improved by the application of the principles in the book alone.\n\nI therefore, highly recommend this book to fellow beginners in photography\n"

aS"\tClassic Larry Niven\n\tThis story, set early in the  quot;Known Space quot; period, is an important part of Larry Niven's future universe, full of his accustomed ingenuity in both the plots and the science. The Protectors don't fit quite comfortably into the  quot;Known Space quot; Universe, and have raised some problems later, for example in the famous  quot;Man-Kzin Wars, quot; where the  quot;Known Space quot; universe has been shared by other writers, including Poul Anderson, Jerry Pournelle, SM Stirling and Hal Colebatch, but the story is fine space opera and entertainment, and has a genuine sense of strangeness and wonder that all too often is lacking from contemporary SF\n"

aS'\tVery Useful and Helpful for speaking Spanish on both sides of the Atlantic but lacked some 21st Century Vocabulary Words\n\tWith respect to my qualifications, I am the founder of the Learning Spanish Like Crazy method. I am also the author of several articles written on the topic of learning Spanish. And now for my review . . . \n\nI tend to judge a Spanish-English Dictionary by the following criteria:\n\n1. Does it provide 21st Century Spanish vocabulary words or only outdated\nSpanish vocabulary?\n\n2. Does it provide BOTH the words that are commonly used in Latin America\nAND Spain or only one or the other?\n\nUsing yardstick number one this book did fairly well. I found words such as "raton" not only defined as "mouse" as in the rodent but also "mouse" as in "computer mouse." And "pantalla" wasn\'t only defined as a "screen" but a a \'computer monitor\' as well. However, it only used the original definition of "bajar" (to lower, to descend, or to go down). It lacked the 21st century definition which is "to download."\n\nUsing yardstick number two, this dictionary did well. For the English word "block" I found the Latin American definition of "cuadra" but I also found the European definition of the word which is "manzana." Several Spanish-English dictionaries that I have used in the past only define the Spanish word "manzana" as the English word "apple," and only define the English word "block" as the Spanish word "cuadra."\n\nIt is important that a dictionary provides both the  Latin American and European Spanish words. From my experience, Latin Americans tend to use\ndifferent vocabulary words from one country to another. But if you use the European Spanish word, even though they may not use the word, they will be familiar with it and will understand you. \n\nOverall, I give this dictionary "cuatro estrellas" (four stars).\n'

aS'\tA  quot;MUST HAVE quot; FOR MALE INTIMACY\n\tI was recommended this book after having taken a Body Electric workshop a few weeks before.  From the first page I began to re-live the entire bonding rituals that we had experienced over that weekend.  How to connect, how to communicate, and how to intimately bond on a higher plane!  Although some of the prose is repetitive, it helps instill a spiritual base on which the reader can pull from. A definite  quot;must have quot; book for the gay tribe who would like to interact spiritually and emotionally\n'

aS'\tAssertiveness Training\n\tAs the authors state in the preface of the book, the main focus of the text is to show the reader how to write high quality contracts. This is not a text intended to convince readers of the veracity of design by contract, but if you are a developer with an academic knowledge of assertions, then this book with its extensive examples will likely convert you to a design by contract advocate.\n\nMost of the examples presented in the book are written in Eiffel, an object oriented language that fully supports preconditions, postconditions and invariants without need for preprocessing. If you haven\'t written code in Eiffel I highly recommend that you download EiffelStudio and deploy the examples in this book. Although there are tools that offer assertion facilities, none provide the ease of use as that seen in the Eiffel language. The text covers a preprocessor that imparts assertions to Java, but the extra steps and unique keywords required to incorporate and activate the assertions are likely to prevent wide scale use of the tool in a software development environment.\n\nSome aspects of object oriented languages such as design by contract and multiple inheritance are often taught through a language and an integrated developer\'s environment that minimally supports the functionality. As such developers form a poor opinion of the concept and not the tool. The keyword support of contracts in Eiffel makes the language a perfect learning tool which will impart a more than academic understanding of the value of assertions. \n\nThe authors state ardently that developers have a choice between spending hours hunting down the causes of runtime errors or instead allocating time to write thorough contracts. As a sometimes Eiffel developer I can state that this assertion is accurate. Since contracts also assign responsibility for the runtime errors, they are invaluable for debugging. I recall an instance when I encountered a postcondition violation while using a linked list from the Eiffel library. As a client of the class, I didn\'t spend any time tracking down the source of the error other than to report it along with the condition that triggered the error to the supplier. In industry significant time is spent debugging code prior to delivery and maintaining code afterwards. Any concept or tool that aids in this function is indispensable to the project. Apparently many people understood this notion since for several years the proposal to broaden Java to include keyword support of programming by contract was purportedly the most frequent "non-bug" report requested by Java developers.\n\nThe book is well organized providing a set of step by step instructions on how to write robust contracts applicable to a wide range of examples from simple data structures to more advanced cases such as the implementation of the Observer Pattern. I considered myself well versed in design by contract but the six principles and guidelines as well as the frame rules, introduced successively via examples, provided a more rigorous approach to developing contracts than I had employed in the past.\n\nIn Chapter 2, the distinction between basic and derived queries is discussed and all six principles are introduced through a stack example. Each principle is unveiled in conjunction with designing methods and their contracts for the data structure.\n\nIn the development of the dictionary class in Chapter 3, the authors present a case for a new query which asks if the dictionary already contains a specific key. The query arises from the specific application of the principles pertaining to postconditions. This is an excellent example of how contracts result in the development of new and needed features in a class. \n\nIn Chapter 6, the authors present a clear rational for weakening inherited preconditions and strengthening postconditions and invariants in accordance with other literature pertaining to the same topic. In particular, the example of a delivery service reads like a case of retail agreement in plain language but is complemented by examples of code and UML diagrams. The concept of guarding postconditions with preconditions to facilitate possible redefinition of methods is also introduced and well explained.\n\nChapter 8 covers the benefits of design by contract and if the reader has compiled and executed the examples presented in the book, they will have experienced some of these benefits firsthand. Of course there are considerations like better documentation and more reliable code, but the debugging assistance is the most overt benefit of contracts. The stack traces associated with assertion exceptions are an invaluable tool during both development and maintenance. Anyone who has developed quality software under a tight schedule understands the benefits of precision bug identification and resolution.\n\nAnalysis by contract, introduced in the final chapter, presents the concepts of design by contract abstractly removed from the code specifics. The authors present an analysis of a person withdrawing money from a bank. In doing so they codify the sequence of events based on the contract stating that the design is "derived from the specification rather than being a design that is also being used as a specification." The obvious implication of this is that the final product will likely fulfill the specification implicitly.\n\nThis is a book packed with knowledge that is essential for all developers regardless of the current support of design by contract in conventional languages. In the future, as the more popular languages incorporate additional design by contract concepts, there will be an increased number of authors producing texts on these topics as well as a growing number of developers annotating their resumes accordingly. I suspect that all of these texts will reference Design by Contract by Example and many of the developers that already understand the concept will be well acquainted with the pages of this book.\n'

aS"\tThe Best Six Sigma Book from alpha to z-tests\n\tThis book is a must have for anyone applying six sigma to real world problems.  Not only do I use it on a nearly daily basis, I'm finding that my engineers are embracing the terminology and concepts so clearly conveyed in this text.  We're spending 20-minutes at each staff meeting to review topics from basic statistics to advanced application of teaming concepts to get results.  Instead of the usual soft stuff application examples that seem to illustrate that the author thinks everyone's making clothes pins, Pyzdek's book shows that he's really lived this stuff.  I highly recommend this book to anyone serious about applying six sigma for results.\n\nJoe Maciulla\nManager, Manufacturing Engineering Systems\nRaytheon Missile System\n"

aS"\t5000 yrs of Western Civilization Mapped Out\n\tI am an inveterate map reader. Whenever I travel there is a map in my pocket. But a recent trip to the Middle East and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as I tried to put in context  the ruins visited and the coins I collected. With time, the names of cities  and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period.   Morkot's superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps, but the  rationale and context for their evolution and change. One of the best  features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview, followed  by a series of in-depth accounts, each from the perspective of the  important  quot;players quot; during a given historical period.  This  approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the  same information is repeated and new information added as each of the  regions, their politics and battles, are succesively presented.  From the  Mycenae to the Parthians are thousands of years, thousands of miles, and  thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of  influence affect us even today. For the first time after years of puzzling  over strange Grecian place names and leaders, I am now able to begin to  understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the  birth of Christ.  I wish this had been the first book I read in my study of  ancient history.  I can hardly wait to start on Penguin's sequel - Acient  Rome\n"

aS'\tAn Often Overlooked Gem\n\tTRUMAN CAPOTE\'s wrote THE GRASS HARP early in his career and it is an often overlooked gem.  This sweet, eccentric, moving and decidedly southern tale is the leisurely paced story of the repercussions that ensue when three townfolk decide to up and run away to live in a treehouse on the outskirts of town.  Three quickly becomes five and eventually swells to even more as the makeshift home becomes a sort of paradise and refuge where stories are shared, closeness is established, and love blooms....think FLANNERY O\'CONNOR meets SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON with a dash of STEEL MAGNOLIAS.  Themes of finding one\'s place and path and making oneself known are skillfully woven into the narrative.  It has the feel of a fantastic and utterly charming myth.  Primary assets are the "thick as molasses" southern mood and syntax as well as a bevy of unforgettable characters.\n'

aS'\tA Great Magazine, A Great Collection, A Great Concept--Can You Tell I Like This Idea?\n\tWe are so truly lucky to live in an age when something like this is possible! Without existing virtual technologies, compiling a complete collection of the New Yorker would otherwise be a near impossibility due to space considerations, availability, and of course the daunting financial investment. For the price of a modest concert, eighty years of intelligent discourse, satire, observation and fiction are all available.

aS'\tLove poems from the Heian era.\n\tJane Hirshfield and Mariko Aratani have done a marvelous job with the translation of these lovely tanka-- manages to capture both their fragility and robust complexity. I had a friend who was a Japanese scholar, who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka. I have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well. Hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called "On Japanese Poetry and the Process of Translation". I recommend it highly, even if you do not normally read this kind of essay.\n\nI am a little bit afraid that the focus on the love poems and the emphasis on Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu as female writers may give the wrong idea about the strength and importance of the poetry. Shikibu is widely considered the greatest poet of her period and Ono no Komachi was one of the Rokkasen-- the six best waka poets of the early Heian period. The reason that I am not giving this volume five stars is because of this packaging and not because of the poetry itself.\n\nThese poems are a joy to read aside from any issues of scholarship. They are strong and sad and very affecting. There is actually no stronger recommendation to read this than the poems themselves, so I will close this review with one of the poems by Shikibu:\n\nWhat is the use\nof cherishing life in spring?\nIts flowers\nonly shackle us\nto this world\n'

aS"\tEngaging and illuminating\n\tBefore reading this book, I'd had a much more black-and-white (sc., mostly black) impression of Jewish life in medieval and early modern Europe. This cogently-writtten volume presents a much more nuanced picture. Ghetto walls were an injustice, but also a refuge for many Jews from the tense environment around them. Oddly enough, this circumstance contributed to the relatively large number of conversions to Christianity in the liberal West after the Napoleonic liberations (in contrast to the shtetl Jews in Poland and Russia, who lived side-by-side with Gentile neighbors). Katz's discussions of of Jewish martyrs during the First Crusade and the flexibility of rabbinic responsa, among other topics, are also quite fascinating.\n"

aS'\tGreat summer read\n\tI found Airframe to be a great book to read on my summer vacation.  I was expecting it to be more of a science fiction novel but it is really a book about corporate intrigue and social commentary (i.e. the media).  That being said, I was not the least disappointed.  \n\nIn his typical style, Crichton takes an aerospace engineering course and boils it down to plain English.  I learned so much about the construction of airplanes and the airline industry - it was fascinating.  He also does a great job in raking the mass media over the coals - which was fun (and somewhat ironic from the creator of "ER")!\n\nThe book is fast paced and reads like a movie - which I am sure is no coincidence by Crichton ;)  The main character is very likeable and you find yourself rooting for her.  There are a number of plot twists and surprises and it certainly keeps you turning the pages.\n\nIn summary I would not say that this is Crichton\'s best work, but it is surely a very enjoyable book that I would recommend to everyone\n'

aS"\tbright and enjoyable, but not especially deep\n\tWhile I agree with several people who don't consider this chick-lit, I don't see why that is a bad thing. I enjoyed Radish's writing style, purple prose and all. If you're expecting a Dickensian journey into a complex character, this book is not it. However, it does provide a snapshot of a woman forced to assess her life and choose between the road less traveled and her current miserable life. \n\nYes, the (positive and negative) circumstances of Meg's life were unrealistic, but I felt they were dramatized to make a point. We all have strong, kind, and amazing people in our lives, but we have to look for these things in people. I had an aunt just like Marcia, who fought her battles with a fantastic sense of humor, courage, and love for everyone around her. The message I took from this book is this - life can be all you want if you simply take the time to nourish your own strength and that of those around you. It doesn't take money to be powerful and satisfied with your life\n"

aS"\tInsightful and Exceedingly Rare Scholarship\n\tKudos to Finkelstein for having the courage to tackle such subject matter.  The fact that he himself, a descendent of Holocaust survivors, has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points: you cannot criticize the state of Israel or its proponents without being labeled an anti-Semite.  Any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless UN resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism.  By far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the Swiss banks; this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition.  Finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion.  Very odd that those on the far left and far right both give accolades to this work.  Hilberg's endorsement carries a tremendous amount of weight, and those unfamiliar with his seminal multi-volume set The Destruction of European Jews would be well served to check it out\n"

You may have also felt a spiritual presence while running, perhaps saying a prayer or working through personal problems while on the trail.  In this extraordinary book, Joslin explores this mind/body connection and gives many different ways to experience the spiritual side of the sport. He shares meditative techniques developed over many years and very rich personal experiences with excerpts from his running journal.  The book is well thought-out and written with a great deal of humility and care.  This is one that I will read again and again.  It changed the way I approach running.  I also think about this book throughout the day, even when I am not running.  A great book\n'

aS'\tA Loving Look At Middle Earth\n\tThis book was originally published ca 1980 as England and Always.  I have not seen the original so I can\'t tell how much of this book is new material (beyond a chapter dealing with Peter Jackson\'s films).  Lobdell has examined Tolkien\'s writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives.  One of the most interesting deals with the influence of Edwardian adventure fiction (Haggard, etc.) on Tolkien.  Another fascinating chapter deals with Middle Earth as a Christian world in a pre-Christian age.  There is also a short fiction story in an Appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to Tolkien\'s own abandoned sequel to The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the Shadow.  I enjoyed this story, though of course Lobdell as a fiction writer cannot measure up to Tolkien. (But then, no one can!)\n\nI am a long time Tolkien reader and addict (since the age of 12 in 1969.)  Most of the time I do not care for Tolkien "criticism" and "literary analysis", which to me seems to suck out the magic, but Lobdell\'s work is different.  The World of the Rings enhances Middle Earth and intensifies the love I feel for it\n'

aS"\tTeaching Kids to Read (Without Stressing Out!)\n\tIn her latest book, Tracey Wood demystifies the process of teaching kids to read.\n\nAs parents, we've all been told that reading is critical to a child's success in school, in a future career and for pleasure and enrichment throughout a lifetime.  We feel a great deal of pressure to help our children achieve this important skill, but typically don't know how to go about it.\n\nTracey presents a refreshingly straightforward, step-by-step approach to teaching reading skills.  The book is chock-full of word lists, fun activities, games, and creative ideas to engage a child's interest and get him reading.  There are helpful book recommendations for readers of all levels (including parents!) and pointers on spotting reading problems early, with practical suggestions for getting help.  The book is spiced with humorous anecdotes parents can truly appreciate.  Tracey's compassion and commonsense shine through and take the stress out of teaching kids to read.\n\nI highly recommend this book to parents of beginning readers.\n"

aS'\tHooray For Hollywood\n\tFirst off this is "A History of Hollywood" not "THE History of Hollywood."  David Thomson isn\'t writing the chronological, straight-up, blow-by-blow account of Hollywood movies.  "The Whole Equation" is an essay that takes as its question, "are Hollywood films ever art like a Beethoven symphony or a Picasso painting?"  He says they are both more and less than that.  More because American film captures the tension between wanting to make money and wanting to say something which allows for the unintentional to happen.  That serendipity is wonderful when it works which isn\'t often.  Less because there are always artistic compromises as someone is always looking at the budget and thinking about the profits.\n\nAnd unlike most film critics he is just fine with this tension.  His argument is that to understand and appreciate American film, you have to understand that it\'s always about the money and about the art.  That means it is never truly art in any pure way (but is any art truly pure?). To tell you the truth, I don\'t think the book succeeds that well on that level.  He  points out various people and their struggles with this dilemma through out the history of American film but he doesn\'t developed a coherent argument that builds on his initial insight.\n\nFor me, that just didn\'t matter.  What makes it a terrific read is that David Thomson knows and loves film.  He writes with a adolescent thrill and openness about his subject that makes it fun and poetic.  He uses the film "Chinatown" as his framing device and as that is my all-time favorite movie, I was in heaven.  He is not a deep thinker but his book crackles with his delight in sensations whether of the movie theater, the audience, the actors, the costumes, the music, all of it.  He constantly raises questions and throws out insights that just tumble onto each other until you realize that like watching a film, you must just suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride.\n'

aS"\ta must-read for anyone who eats\n\tIf you read one book on food ethics in your life, it should be this book.\n\nSinger and Mason's book is an excellently researched and foot-noted exploration of three different American diets, tracing these diets back to their sources and showing the many hidden affects that our food choices have on our environment, our neighbors, the animals that many of us eat, and ultimately ourselves. This book shows how these seemingly innocuous choices really do make a difference in our world, and then guides the reader towards resources which might help them make different choices, if they so choose.\n\nThis book is not only full of an amazing depth and breadth of information on everything from organics, to local food, to intensive factory farms, to fair trade products, it also is immensely readable. The meetings with the three different families are very vivid and help to humanize these issues further. \n\nI highly recommend this book to every thinking person who eats. Which is, really, all of us. Please read this book! Do yourself, your neighbors and your planet a favor! \n\n(:,\nJennife\n"

aS'\tHelpful information for parents willing to develop their childen readership\n\tIn general the book provides some simple tips of how to help your children to learn reading by having fun and develop a taste for reading.

aS"\tA strong argument for tort reform\n\tHere is the disclaimer:  I was already a proponent of tort reform before I read this book.  However, after reading this novel, I am a stronger proponent of it than ever.  Enter Clay Carter - unknown defender in D.C. of the poorest of the poor.  Then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap, one he can't refuse, partly because the parent's of his long-time girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money.\n\nGive Carter a taste of money, then the greed sets in.  For the middle half of the book, we get to see unadulterated greed come to run his life!  Especially infuriating is how he lets that greed come before the well-being of his clients.  This is what will be his undoing.  One of his clients who was already ticked off at a settlement he made gets a terminal illness and decides to go after his lawyer.  This is the rags to riches to almost rags in the course of about eighteen months.\n\nGrisham actually makes you feel sympathetic with the main charater (Clay Carter) through his rise, and especially his fall.  That shows to the quality of his storytelling.  In fact, while Carter is in some ways a sympathetic character, he mostly is not!  Mass torts and greed is the theme of this story.  The fact that he came back to haunt him was only justice.  Too bad such justice doesn't often happen in the real world of mass torts\n"

aS"\tSharp insight from Virginia Postrel\n\tI consider myself an optimist and insightful person, but somehow managed to miss many of Postrel's insights. She gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than I previously thought. She does keep that hope in check, though, by talking about the enemies of the future- primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat, instead of the blessing that it is. \n\nShe thoroughly destroys the notion that 'there is nothing new under that sun'. While the universe, therefore our earth, is necessarily finite, we misunderstand this finiteness because we misunderstand the different combinations things can be arranged in. For example, a deck of cards has only 52 cards, but the number of combinations you can put the cards into is 52x51x50x49x...x3x2x1, which is a number larger than the number of particles in the universe! So whenever you shuffle a deck of cards, you can rest assured, that that is probably the one and only time that arrangement of cards will ever be in existence... ever. \n\nPeople are so inventive and creative and always looking for new things. Obviously, there will always be new things. Every time someone declares that we are nearing the end of history, science, technology, etc. it's safe to say they have no idea what they are talking about. We need to let people be as creative and as inventive as they can. It will only make our lives better, on the whole. There will always be setbacks, but as long as people can think, we will always find a way to make out of those setbacks. \n\nThe book is a stunning, intelligent look at modern life. I liked it so much, I bought The Substance of Style, which is, yet, another insightful look at modern life.\n"

aS"\tnot restricted to just educational context\n\tMuch of the book's material is not restricted to educational research. It is generally applicable to anyone who wants to perform experimental studies in the social sciences. Where you need to deal with human subjects. Granted, in the book, these subjects are often primary school kids. \n\nBut the guidelines given in such matters as the general steps for qualitative research, data collection and data analysis are quite general. Likewise further in the book, when it discusses quantitative research. \n\nThe book's discussion of statistics is necessarily abbreviated; directed at a reader unfamiliar with chi square tests and the like. But still easily understood\n"

aS'\tI wish all textbooks were like this one...\n\tAs an econ student at UC Davis, I have learned to appreciate books that explain concepts concisely and in an easily understandable way.  This is one of those few.  Chapters are relatively short and are uncluttered with unnecessary examples or tangents.  Graphs are labeled with simple explanations that are useful for clarification as well as quick-reference.  \nI recommend this book to people who want to understand econ without trudging through the swamp of repetition, needless technicality, and headache\n'

aS'\tAnother "I wish I would have read this earlier in life!" book\n\tWhether you are new to dating, widowed or divorced and starting to date again, or in your 50th year of marriage - you will be able to gleam something from this book that will impact your life in a positive way.\n\nIdeally - you could read this book before you embark upon the "dating chapter" of your life.  But, even if you\'re not new to dating, this book can make an amazing and positive impact in many ways - it can increase your chances of finding the right person, reduce your chances of being hurt by or hurting someone (emotionally) during the dating process, and help you avoid scaring away someone with whom, otherwise, you could end up having a wonderful relationship.\n\nI especially recommend this to women who are in a relationship (or, who are thinking that they "thought they were") with a man who seems to have changed all of a sudden.  If you are questioning things like, where did he go? why didn\'t he call?  why does he seem so distant now?  what did I do wrong? - you are possibly at a point in the relationship where your choice of actions can make or break a relationship that might just be on the edge of going somewhere.  And, likewise, I recommend this to men who feel that they\'ve come to a point in their relationship where they all of a sudden "aren\'t sure" anymore, are feeling anxious or maybe even "trapped", and at the same time there is a strong need to just get away and think and/or if the woman you are dating seems to have become more insecure, worries more, questions you more, starts pressuring you more about commitment, etc.  All of these situations, emotions, etc. are explained in this book.  You\'re not the only one - it\'s a normal part of dating - but, unfortunately, most of us won\'t possibly be able to understand this without someone else pointing it out to us - like Gray has done in this book.\n\nEven if you are married - this book opens your eyes to many things and can really improve your level of understanding with your wife/husband.\n\nIf you are the perfect mate in a perfect relationship - you may not realize some of the problems other people experience and therefore, could probably benefit from this book by being able to better identify with friends, family, children when they come to you for advice\n'

aS'\tA story of survival\n\tHow does she do it? \nThis will forever be one of my favorite books. Reading about the astoundingly crazy life Mary Karr had as a child made me wonder how her sense of humor could be so sharp and perfect and still get across the sadness and pathos without making me feel bad or hopeless. \n\nNor did I feel that she was in a hopeless situation. It always seemed as though there were morsels of goodness somewhere to be found. A profoundly inspiring book. I only hope I can be as resourceful and resilient\n'

aS'\tHaving to live another day was the worst nightmare...\n\tIn 2003 I suffered my worst major depression ever. It lasted for over a year, and in the worst moments -which lasted months- my anguish was so intense that I wished I were dead. Again, the worst part was when I couldn\'t even get a full night\'s rest, and after just two or three hours of sleep would wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. full of despair, unable to even pray or meditate or get any kind of relief, and anguished at the prospect of the new day approaching... Having to get up in the morning was hell. Needless to say I couldn\'t work, and that increased my ill-feelings and my guilt at seeing how my wife had to shoulder the full responsibility in our family of four (we have two adolescent kids). \nReading Andrew Solomon\'s book, which I found recommended at depression-blog at blogspot dot com was an extraordinary experience, because for the first time ever I found my own reflected on the written page by a gifted writer who has also suffered the extreme anguish and pain of major depression.\nIn my illness, I found that psychiatrists, doctors and other therapists who haven\'t themselves gone through the hellish nightmare of a major depression simply cannot understand what it is like. It\'s just like what happens with someone who has never eaten an orange: no matter how much you you try to explain how it tastes, the other person will have no real understanding unless he/she eats one him/herself. Same with friends and well-wishers of many sorts, who will tell you things like "Cheer up!" or "Make an effort!" without realizing that that\'s precisely what you would most want to do -but can\'t. \nSolomon\'s book and the advise of Mike S. -now a friend, and the guy who created the depression-blog at blogspot dot com- have been of great value to me. And of course the courage and love of my wife, who never -even in the worst moments, when we both thought I might die at any moment- abandoned hope, sustaining me, putting up with a lot, holding me when I cried in utmost despair and wished I were dead as the only relief in the midst of what now I recall as the worst kind of torture a human being can be subjected to...\nAnd my kids, too, who at times even made me laugh with a joke or helped me get some sleep with a massage. And God, who in the midst of utter darkness and despair, was there too, and saw me through\n'

aS'\tReasons for being alone\n\tSo here is a collection of essays by Jonathan Franzen, the wizard who brought us the highly intelligent and acutely mesmerizing novel of 2001, The Corrections. Many of these essays originally appeared in literati mags such as Harper\'s and The New Yorker--so, readers should know what they\'re getting into. I read this book mainly as an attempt to try to get a sense of Franzen as a corporeal human being, and not just some exalted author of an award-winning novel. Overall, I liked most of the essays appearing in this collection. From the promising opener, in which Franzen poignantly recounts his father\'s slow descension into quietus from Alzheimer\'s, we progress to a quasi-portentous pronouncement of the dangerous state of privacy in America, before Ashcroft and the Patriot Act invaded the American lexicon. Why Bother (which was previously referred to as The Harper\'s Essay) is an interesting rumination on the inevitable failure of the novel in the 21st Century as a tool of social reform; the novel should not be used as a way to engender social reform, but, should rather be written--ultimately-- for plain old entertainment value, Franzen seems to argue. \n Some of these essays seem to be a little discursive; Franzen evidentally has a lot to say, and seems to forget what the initial point of his arguments are, going off on long tangents; such as in Mr. Difficult, where as some other reviewer stated, he begins with an interesting exploration of his artistic need to be "pretentious," but then slowly veers off into a history and ode to author William Gaddis.\n \n Franzen once again proves to be a smart and sophisticated reader and writer, and this book perfectly showcases his aptitude for social commentary, without pontificating or being too offensively forward. People may consider Franzen an "elitist," but I consider him to posses a well-read, inquisitive mind; there are far too few Jonathan Franzens around these days\n'

aS'\tNo Baloney Here: Straight Shooting Advise From an Insider\n\tIn a sea of books from self-proclaimed "career counselors," Mr. Corcodilos has no-nonsense advice from a true insider.  Instead of the usual yada-yada, Corcodilos explains how a candidate can stand out in a sea of prospective employees clambering in a recruiting system designed to produce the status quo.\n\nOne hears a lot of complaints from hiring managers that effective, qualified employees are in short supply.  However, Corcodilos lays bare the true cause of this corporate angst:  The present recruiting system is broken.\n\nAsk the headhunter is worthwhile reading for both the candidate and the hiring manager; two agents who are in desperate need to meet\n'

aS'\tWhy Classics are Classics\n\tAs one reads Peter Pan, one doesn\'t have to do much thinking to figure out why its story has achieved such worldwide acclaim.  I had ridiculously high expectations of Mr. Barrie\'s imagination before purchasing this title, and he has fulfilled them completely.\n\nMany parts of the story are nothing but nonsense, which I enjoy above all else.  Mr. Darling, the head of the Darling family, commands his children to take their medicine after he hides the medicine he\'s supposed to take.  He brags about how noble he is for drinking a medicine that tastes so much worse that theirs.  Unfortunately for him, during his bragging his medicine is found, and the whole family agrees to take their respective medicines on the count of three.  Sure enough, when three is reached, everyone except Mr. Darling takes their medicine, and Mr. Darling once again tries to hide his.\n\nThis kind of scenario is what I\'d call Mark Twain nonsense.  You can imagine it being true, even though it\'s quite high up on the ridiculous scale.  Then there\'s what I would classify as over-the-top nonsense - AKA bull - which there is plenty of in Barrie\'s original story of Peter Pan.  Going back to Mr. Darling, if we take a look at how he\'s doing near the end of the book, we find him going to and from work in a dog kennel.  Ah, yes...grown men in pet taxis.  What could be more fun than the "he-didn\'t-even-try-to-make-this-belivable" silliness of such a scene?  To be honest, I don\'t know if I\'d even read books if they all left out fun stuff like this.\n\nOther silly parts of the book involve Wendy growing up a day quicker than most girls; the narrator claiming he hates Mrs. Darling only to call her his favorite character a few sentences later; the lost boys asking Wendy to change the characters her story just two sentences into it; the narrator using the phrase "woke into life" because Peter likes the word "woke" more than "wakened;" and my favorite, Captain Hook using a stale cake as a missle and then falling over it in the dark.\n\nI believe the novel version of Peter Pan was written after the author had already established Peter Pan as a successful play.  That may explain a lot about the colorful narration, which takes many, many literary liberties.  We see everything from blatant narrator interference with the characters in the story to the shameless attempt at informing the audience that the narrator only chooses to make the events in the story happen a certain way so certain characters in the book won\'t be disappointed.  Perhaps without these wacky (and maybe even insane) traits in the narration, there\'d be no reason to read the book, since it would be no different from the play.  After reading the Peter Pan novel though, I\'d have to say it almost seems criminal to watch an adaptation of Peter Pan without any wacky narration.\n\nContrary to most adaptations of Peter Pan, the individual lost boys (of where there are six I believe) are actually more developed as characters than John or Michael Darling.  Heck, at the end of the book they actually end up moving out of the Neverland to live with the Darlings and grow up to busy themselves in interesting professions.\n\nI may not like the actual land of Neverland as much as I like the land of Oz, but Barrie\'s narration is unbeatable in my opinion.  He could probably make a Jeopardy contestant\'s Friday night schedule sound exciting.\n\nI believe Barrie has written another Peter Pan book as well, a prequel of sorts entitled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens."  It should be interesting, particuarly if it addresses what is contained in the dark dreams that haunt Peter throughout this book.  Freud would have a field day with such dreams and the whole mother issue.\n\nThe only thing I expected to see in this book that I didn\'t see was "happy thoughts."  That must have been a creation of Disney\n'

We live in a world where people sell drugs that kill our kids for money and your worried about this guy making a few bucks with a writing career?  It's called priorities people, get some.  I say he should continue to write and see what he becomes.  \n\nI have read Tolkien (not just The Hobbit and LOTR - but ALL of his works).  Dark Tower, Harry Potter, and Star Wars stuff too.  I love Sci-Fi.  Stop nitpicking.  If your at that point then you have lost the purpose of picking up a good sci-fi book.  Start over.  Do not pass go and do not collect $200.00.\n"

aS'\tOutstanding\n\tDale Carnegie is one of the authors I have admired for so long. There are numerous reasons why this book is a classic one. He deeply believes that in every person there is good and you can approach it. Of course, there are many negative people who don\'t like this book because they see everything in black and white. Carnegie on the other side advocates a really delicate, positive and humane approach to everyone around you. It comes very close to "treat the others as you want them to treat you". I am sure that if everyone read and apply the principles in this wonderful book, the world will be a better place. I am sure that you will be pleased as well with his talent to really understand what drives people. Some of the key and basic motivators he discussed are sex and being important. His viewpoint is very close to the one of the bestselling author of scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex. After all genius things are usually simple. Carnegie explores the human nature and common hot buttons together with the reader and gives you tools to manage and push them at your will with the help of numerous examples. I liked that the book is practical, easy and fun to read, and most of all that it delivers great value. I can not say the same for many other books. Definitely get a copy especially if you are a "good" person and prefer to treat people with respect and dignity\n'

It's about a driven man, Michael Dell, who came up with a simple idea - direct sales - and then expanded his company into the world's second biggest manufacturer of personal computers. Dell's personal story is inseparable from the story of his company, and his book gives readers his unfiltered, first-person perspective. He covers his company's history, challenges, problems and successes in an unvarnished, matter-of-fact style. We highly recommend this book to anyone in the computer industry, to entrepreneurs and to managers who want to make their small businesses grow\n"

aS'\tJules Gets Four Stars\n\tSuzanne Brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in.  The "mystery" portion of the story and the romance between Jane and Cosmo left a little to be desired.  I really didn\'t understand why Jane had to have her alternative personality as Mercedes and Cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened SEAL persona.  These particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to Jules and Robin, who clearly stole the show in this book. \n\nAs a matter of fact, of the different plots and stories going on in this book, Jules\' was the best.  It was not only very well-written and sweet, but even as a hetrosexual female, I could identify with Jules and how he felt at times because what was happening to him, happens to all of us, whether you are in a gay or straight relationship.  I am really hoping that Jules either gets his own book, or has more appearances in future novels where he does find true happiness. I do share Ms. Brockmann\'s opinion when it comes to differences in appearance, nationality, sexual orientation, etc. and I really like how she includes this in her books.  As far as I\'m concerned love is love, no matter what and it\'s portrayed beautifully here.\n\nPlease Ms. Brockmann, don\'t allow the naysayers to steer you away from this storyline, it\'s a very good one\n'

aS'\tIncredibly Useful!\n\tAs a prospective college student, I have to tell you how much I appreciate Students\' Guide to Colleges. It combines many of the best features of the Princeton Review and Fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness. I also appreciate that it is without any trying-to-sound-hip blather because these are not editor-interjected profiles, they\'re written by actual students. This is a great compliment--I have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year, and this is the best guide to colleges among the many I\'ve seen. I also just read the Oberlin College profile in this book with an Oberlin alum and relative. She said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate Oberlin portrayal she\'s read in a guide. Among other things, she and I loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable-in-previous-guides questions like "what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour?" The guide\'s honesty also impressed me, as the Fiske guide lauded Vassar\'s "diversity," for example, where Students\' Guide admits "Although Vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot, most students are actually wealthy and white." I am confident in saying that anyone applying anywhere from Hampshire to Harvard will find this book incredibly useful!! \n\n-Josh\n'

aS'\tThe Greatest Book on John Lennon\n\tThe original publication of _The Lives of John Lennon_ in 1988 was accompanied by hysteria.  Much of it emanated from Yoko Ono, who likened Goldman\'s book to "being punched in the face."  Yoko is a close friend of Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine, which duly ran an article attempting to discredit Goldman\'s book.  Some of Lennon\'s fans took this behavior in and assumed that _The Lives of John Lennon_ was forbidden; they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty.  \n\nNow, however, the dust has settled, and _The Lives of John Lennon_ holds up beautifully.  Each contention of Goldman\'s which was alleged to be outrageous in 1988 stands.  Remember the ridiculous panic over Goldman\'s portrait of Lennon as a heavy drug user?  That drug use has now been acknowledged by just about everyone who knew Lennon, including Ono and Lennon\'s first wife, Cynthia Powell.  The same is true about Goldman\'s claims about Lennon\'s tendency towards violence (a tendency Lennon himself owned up to in his Playboy interview).  And, while Ono and others acted agitated over Goldman\'s depiction of Lennon as bisexual, Ono herself is found to have said she considered John Lennon a "closet fag" in a 1981 interview.  (Why, then, was Ono so upset by the appearance of Goldman\'s book?  Because of what it reveals about her.)    \n     \nIt will be clear to anyone who approaches Goldman\'s book with a fair mind that the outrage its publication originally sparked was unjustified.  _The Lives of John Lennon_ is not dishonest or flawed in any way.  A perusal at his "Sources" section reveals his awesome thoroghness.  Goldman bravely explored areas of Lennon\'s and Ono\'s lives that others shied away from out of deference to Ono, a worshipful attitude towards Lennon, and a reluctance to figure things out.  Albert Goldman was the most fearless and thorough writer to approach this subject.  _The Lives of John Lennon_ might be overwhelming to the infantile fans who deify Lennon, but for those with genuine interest in Lennon, it is indispensable.\n'

Granted, not every piece is exactly 16 bars.  Some go a bit over, but this is usually excusable due to proper phrasing.  It's well worth looking into for those who are just starting out.

I think the packaged cake mixes from the store have a nice taste, so these recipes just build on those mixes.  I just want easy recipes that aren't intimidating, and this book is the solution for that.   I highly reccommend The Cake Mix Doctor.\n"

aS"\tTerrific reference material\n\tGrowing one's herbs is satisfying but using them completes the cycle. If you've ever wondered what to do with all the herbs you've managed to put in your garden over the years this book can help you. If you are just starting out with herbs this book can get you going properly. Not only does it have recipes but it has some ideas that I never could have imagined let alone used. The bulk of the book is dedicated to the herbal index which is extremely helpful. Each illustrated herb is broken down and expalined simply as to it's use, from root to leaves. The only problem I found with this section is that it is organized by their botanical names, which unless you're so inclined is difficult to find quickly. This is a minor problem that is remedied by the oversized common name, which of course is not alphabetized but more recognizable. A page is dedicated to over 100 of the most common herbs used. It tells you how to cultivate the individual herb and it's uses, which includes the medicinal use. Even if I don't use all the herbs or have them growing in my garden it is fascinating to know the historical and contemporary use of herbs. This book is a constant learning experience that can be read over and over. A perfect garden companion for that break under a tree. The knowledge can prove to be invaluable. Even such common herbs as Thyme can present posssibly new insights into it's benefits. Have trouble sleeping? The leaves of Thyme can help insomnia as well as stimulate the production of white corpusules to resist infection amongst it's many other attributes. There is much more information than I need here but there is something for everyone, from herbal dyes, to baths and massages and to the ever popular potpourri. This is, as the title suggests, the complete book on herbs. A great book for the kichen or to help you plan your herb garden, this book has as many uses as the author presents uses for the herbs\n"

aS'\tI love Alex.\n\tDr. Alex Delaware is completely incorrigible! I love this character, but no wonder his pal Milo is going gray - keeping Alex out of trouble is a full time job! There is a scene in this one where Milo tells Alex straight out not to go snooping - he tells him, "I know you ..." Yeah, Milo knows him all right, and so do we, don\'t we? (And if you don\'t - read the books! They\'re great!)\n\nOkay, Alex is a clinical psychologist who is semi-retired, does mostly forensic work now for the court and the police. His best friend Milo Sturgis is a homicide detective with the LAPD. Once Alex gets involved in a mystery, he is incapable of letting it go. In all fairness, it is Milo who gets him involved in this one. \n\nAlex and his girlfriend Robin are rebuilding their house - she\'s a carpenter, so she\'s very hands-on with the rebuilding. In the meantime, they\'re living on the beach in Malibu. Sweet.\n\nMilo is quite taken by one of the jurors involved in a particularly gruesome and high profile case. Ever since the trial, Lucy Lowell has been having nightmares and Milo asks his friend Alex to try to help her. She\'s quite a character and Alex is taken by her too. (Things get a little complicated when she reveals her crush on Milo - FINALLY! A woman falls for Milo! (I\'m not the only one!) The fact he\'s gay does put a crimp in things, but no matter). While her recurring dream becomes more intense, other strange happenings have her - and everyone else - questioning her sanity. But there is obviously more going on than anyone originally thought and Alex is afraid maybe this dream is not a nightmare at all, but a long suppressed childhood memory. The memory of a murder.\n\nMilo is tied up with another complicated case, so Alex goes off digging on his own - again. I had to laugh - several times, Alex comments about doing something "on impulse" and I\'m sitting there waiting for someone to try to kill him. The lies come so easy for him in this one - he\'s been getting a lot of practice. He pretends to be a journalist, a freelance novelist, a publisher and he even manages to keep his lies straight - he\'s amazing! But the inevitable happens and he and Lucy find themselves staring down the wrong end of a gun. \n\nThe mystery is 20 years old, so it\'s a very cold trail and a very complicated case - you won\'t figure it out - the ending is quite a surprise\n'

aS'\tA Focus on Hardware Optimization\n\t"GPU Gems 2" edited by Matt Pharr (Addison-Wesley, 2005, ISBN 0-321-33559-7) is a collection of forty-eight white papers that detail cutting edge techniques based on today\'s latest graphical processing units (GPU).  The full color hardcover text is 784 pages and includes a CD-ROM with working demos and source for some of the articles presented in the book.  The text retails for $59.99.\n\nThe book is divided into six parts: geometric complexity, shading, high-quality rendering, general purpose computation on the GPU, image oriented computing, and numerical algorithms.  A part has anywhere from five to twelve chapters.  Each chapter is written by a different author but the format and style is consistent.  The chapters have an introduction, discussion of the problem or technique, conclusion, and references.  The material is presented with color illustrations and occasionally some pseudo-code or code fragments.  Generally, the material is extremely current and very approachable to read.\n\nAs a sequel to its well received predecessor, the text focuses on taking advantage of the computational power and features of today\'s high-powered GPU boards.  The first part of the book, geometric complexity, emphasizes this with chapters dedicated to batch rendering, using multi-streaming, hardware occlusion, and displacement pixel-shaders.  Each chapter illustrates how operations traditionally performed on the CPU can be moved into the GPU for efficiency and greater effect.\n\nThe subsequent two parts on shading and rendering continue along the same theme: improved performance by using hardware functionality found on the GPU.  Each topic considers the performance ramifications and GPU capabilities when discussing the problem domain of a rendering technique and factors it into the final solution.  For example, chapter 10 considers irradiance environment maps for fast lighting - but with a twist - using the GPU to do the calculations in real-time.  In doing so, the book\'s real value becomes apparent.\n\nThe fourth part on general purpose GPU computation is an interesting addition to the text.  The chapters illustrate methods of offloading traditional CPU tasks by exploiting the inherent parallel nature of modern GPU hardware.  Since the book features Nvidia hardware, the architecture and performance capabilities largely focused on their products.  \n\nIn the fifth part of the book, hardware assisted image creation and analysis is considered.  By using context clues from the spatial, texture, or lighting data - additional refinements can be made to a scene prior to rasterization.  The topics presented in this part are further refinements of the text\'s main theme (using the GPU fully) and are specific solutions to uncommon problems - or approaches to rasterization.  None the less as GPUs continue to evolve, the topics presented in this section will undoubtedly become more common.\n\nFinally, the sixth part of the book provides several non-traditional graphics examples to illustrate calculating data on the GPU: solving linear equations, options pricing, and numerical simulation - just to name a few. As using the raw floating point power of modern GPU is a growing trend - these sections were quite interesting and well done.\n\nThe included CD-ROM contains examples to 28 of the 48 articles in the book.  In most cases, the example material includes source code as well as pre-compiled binaries to help illustrate the topic presented in the text.   In order to run the majority of the samples, Cg must be installed on the host computer.  In addition, the CD-ROM provides access to Nvidia\'s software development kit, Cg toolkit, performance tools, and several helpful reference links to on-line sites.\n\nGPU Gems 2 provides a cutting edge view of the capabilities found in today\'s video cards.  The selected articles illustrate that every part of the rendering process can be enhanced in some fashion by fully using the underlying hardware.  As such, this book is essential to anyone working with modern GPUs.\n'

aS"\tThe Art of Chinese Swordsmanship\n\tWow! This is a wonderful reference book not only for Taiji Jian (tai chi sword), but also for Taiji Quan. All sections of the book are straight forward and easy to follow. There wasn't any mystical  quot;mumbo jumbo quot; I couldn't comprehend. The first chapter which gives the reader information about the history of the Taiji jian, I particlularly liked this historical information. Chapter two is for Taiji jian and Tai Chi Quan practitioners. This chapter explains clearly the  quot;ins and outs quot; of Taiji Quan and Taiji jian. The author explains basic trainning, principles, elements, etc. I found this section of great interest to me having only studied Taiji Quan for about a year now. I believe the information I've gainned from reading this section will help improve my practice.I think advanced practitioners will find chapter two valuable as well. The remaining chapters 3-8 give the reader information on the parts of the jian, how to practce with the jian, basic movements,fighting principles, and a 32 posture form with pictures and detailed explanations. The explaination of each picture includes info about the key points, internal components and the movement itself. This is a great manual that I know I will refer to over and over again. This is a must read book for any Taiji Quan or Taiji jian practitioner\n"

aS"\tThis book tells girls what good sportsmanship is all about.\n\tquot;Good Sports quot; is a book which helps girls to be the  quot;best athlete you can be. quot; It catagorizes players, parents, and other important people into real-life situations. It has quizes, quotes from  other athletes, and memory pages. Also, it offers a lot of web sites and  other addresses for girls to look up their favorite sports. More  importantly, this book shows girls what teamwork and good sportsmanship is  all about. One of my favorite parts in the book says:  quot;Sometimes heart  is the strongest muscle. quot; This book also tells girls how to take good  care of yourself- to eat healthy so that you are a better athlete. It  includes the food pyramid and what one serving is.  quot;Good Sports quot;  involves  quot;Power Drills quot; and advice from other girls. It goes  inside the lives of other athletes, such as Michelle Kwan, but also shows  girls'lives who are teens or pre-teens.  This book not only focuses on the  physical parts of playing a game, but on the mental part as well: keeping  your dreams alive even when you're at the bottom of the team, or you were  embarrassed at a basketball game when you tripped. I would reccommend   quot;Good Sports quot; to any female athelete, whether you are experienced  or haven't even started yet. It teaches you the basics and also the mental  parts of a game! It has advice on keeping your mind and body strong, along  with being a good winner and loser. It has advice from other athletes,  famous or otherwise, memory pages to record your victories, dreams and  goals, and ways to reach sports associations. As the book says, it includes   quot;Winning. Losing. And everything in between. quot\n"

aS"\tMr. Explainer does it again\n\tWhen I read Ron Penton's first book, Data Structures for Game Programming, I couldn't wait to see what he did next. MUD Game Programming lived up to all of my expectations, and indeed surpassed them.\n\nThe author has an extraordinary knack for making complex topics understandable -- and, equally important, making them interesting. Reading MUD Game Programming is like having a friendly, cheerful expert sitting down next to you and showing you the tricks of the trade. Instead of just telling you what to do, he explains the thinking behind the decisions that go into the design of a complex program such as a MUD server, enabling you to make the decisions that are right for your own project, which might not be the same. You end up with not just knowledge but understanding.\n\nI highly recommend MUD Game Programming to people doing any type of network-based multiplayer programming, not just traditional MUDs. I'd give this book six stars if they'd let me\n"

aS'\tAnna Anderson WAS Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia\n\tAnna Anderson/ Anastasia\n\n \nI have researched this great mystery for some time now and I have concluded that the woman, Anna Anderson, could not have been an imposter. Not only did she never give any signs of playing a part, but she was in posession of all sorts of little facts and information that no one on the outside could have known. She knew of Gleb Botkin\'s paintings before he even came to see her, she knew exactly what she and her sister Tatiana had been doing while WWI was being declared for Russia (this was confirmed by Dr. Rudnev who was visiting Russia and saw Anastasia and Tatiana at that time), she had intimate knowledge of every single royal house in Europe, and could recognize her royal cousins- sight unseen- by their voices alone. One must wonder how a demented Polish farming girl could do that. Aside from just her character, there the many scars and lacerations on her body, as well as the bunions on her feet identical to Anastasia and the cautorized mole on the shoulder which was verified to have been on the young Anastasia as well by a standart officer who did not even support Anna Anderson\'s claim. For over six decades, Royal cousins and friends to Anastasia would try and trip this woman up with tricks. They would misstate things just to see if she would catch them and she always would. It is virtually impossible for someone to go 65 years without ever being caught in a mistake. Anna had people such as Alexei Volkov and Alexadra Tegleva in tears after having met her because they were so touched. No one has ever yet attempted to explain why Ambassador Zahle and Grand Duke Andrew\'s papers are still kept secret, why Doris Wingender touched up her photographs in court, or why Pierre Gilliard had his scandalous midnight \'burning\' of evidence. To this day, anthropologists who compare Anna Anderson\'s face, ears, and handwriting specimens to the young girl she claimed to be declare with certainty that the "two" women are the same. \n   The Franziska Schanzkowska story is clearly a lie from beginning to end. Anna Anderson was several inches shorter than Franziska Schanzkowska, wore a size shoe three inches smaller, was not mentally insane like Franziska, she spoke a bad German while FS spoke German as her first language, and could understand Russian. The Schanzkowska siblings did not understand a word of Russian when spoken to them. AA clearly understood Russian. Anderson also gave birth to a child. There is no record of Franziska ever having a child. Recent documents also show that Schanzkowska was never injured in the grenade explosion which supposedly infliced the wounds on Anna Anderson\'s body. The DNA tests have won the hour, but I hope the future will see the release of Ambassador Zahle and GD Andrew\'s papers to cast even more doubt on this. Richard Schweitzer\'s switch theory is very probable given the doubts about the identification with Schanzkowska as well as the security measures which were not that good at Martha Jefferson Hospital during the complicated court battle between Marina Botkin Schweitzer and the Russian Nobiltiy Association. According to Massie\'s book, one researcher was even allowed access to the intestinal tissue during this time. Is it reasonable that the Royal families would ignore the fact that Anna Anderson was about to recieve recognition as the Tsar\'s daughter after they had been fighting to disprove her all her life? \n   In any case, the body of Anastasia is still missing, although in Russia there lies a body under the coffin which reads \'Anastasia\' measuring 5\'7, despite the fact that Anastasia was the shortest of her sisters. If this isn\'t reason enough to be suspicious that there is some sort of agenda, I don\'t know what is. I\'m afraid however that the body lies in the ashes spread over Castle Seeon under the stone which reads, "Anastasia Manahan 1901-1984". \n   To end this, I will quote Empress Alexandra\'s best friend (aside from Anna Vyrobouva) Lili Dehn, who met Anna Anderson in 1957(?) and declared, "Don\'t bother to tell me she has read these things in books. I have recognized her physically and intuitively, through signs which do not decieve. What can I say after having known her? I could not have been mistaken."\n\nThis is to explain my conviction that Anna Anderson was Anastasia. I think there is something about the DNA we do not know. \n\nThe File on the Tsar- 2002 edition... p. 362 \n\n\'Nearly fifty years ago, Anna Anderson told a story about a sketch she and her sister had put on to amuse their parents during their confinement in Tobolsk. She played a male part, she \'recalled\', and and had to borrow a man\'s dressing-gown. At a pivotal moment in the play, a freak draught made the dressing gown billow up around their thighs, revealing that she was wearing the tsar\'s long-johns- against the bitter cold of the Siberian winter. The family, said Anna Anderson, had hooted with laughter. \nThe only witnesses from the imperial household who would have been present at that scene, and who are known to have survived, were the two family tutors-both foreigners. One was the English tutor, Sydney Gibbes, and his memoirs were published for the first time in 1975. They include this account of an incident during amatuer theatricals in Tobolsk. \n"The cast," Gibbes wrote, "had its happiest night with an Edwardian farce by Henry Grattan, called \'Packing Up\', ... Anastasia took the male part... at the end of the farce the \'Husband\' had to turn his back, open his Dressing-gown as if to take it off- Anastasia used an old one of mine... but a draught got under the gown and whisked its tail up to the middle of her back, showing her sturdy legs and bottom encased Emperor Jaguer\'s underwear...\' \nSo far as exhaustive research can establish, only Anna Anderson had ever before told this vivid ancedote, in private and three decades before the Gibbes memoirs appeared. If Anderson was a phoney, as the seemingly damning DNA evidence now tells us, how did she know the story? \nThat was one of the myriad puzzles that believers in Anna Anderson had to confront when the scientists delivered their verdict. Ian Lilburn, a research historian and the only observer to attend every session of the "Anastasia" appeal process in the German courts, had a calmer response than some. "I think," he said, knowing he sounded like a Luddite and Romanov flat-earther, " there is something we don\'t know about the DNA." \n\n\nMaybe after reading you can understand why some of us don\'t believe the DNA was Anna Anderson\'s, and why we don\'t believe she was the tall, size \'36 shoe wearing Franziska Schanzkowska who could not have had such exclusive info if she were an imposter.\n'

aS"\tInsightful!\n\tThings are going swimmingly in Fish! land. In the latest volume, Fish! Tales, authors Stephen C. Lundin, John Christensen, Harry Paul and Philip Strand build on the successful training program that evolved from their first Fish book. Tales shows how four companies - a long-distance call center; a hospital neural-renal unit, a car dealership and a roofing company - have applied Fish! theories effectively. They also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the Fish! function. The four main principles are familiar by now - keep the work fun, seek to serve others, stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude - but the examples in the book bring them alive. Along the way, the authors heavily sell their Fish! courses and merchandise - that's just good salesmanship - but the real catch of the day is the final how-to section, showing ways to apply these principles in any organization. The lively writing style helps keep you hooked. We suggest that if you haven't yet caught any Fish!, start with this one. Its cheery, accessible methods should lure you in, hook, line and sinker\n"

aS"\tfantastic English mystery in the Christie tradition\n\tWhile on maternity leave from Cambridge University and with her husband away handling a legal matter in Los Angeles, Professor Cassandra James meets her neighbor actress Melissa Meadows and her spouse Keith Kingleigh.  Melissa and Cassandra share an affinity since both recently gave birth prematurely.  Kevin is going to direct a production starring Melissa.  He asks Cassandra to adapt the Victorian drama East Lynn, which she agrees to do.\n\nAs opening night beckons, Cassandra notices the cast seems extra nervous.  Later an anxious Melissa calls Cassandra believing that someone is stalking her.  Cassandra tries to calm her down.  The next day Melissa fails to appear for a rehearsal so Cassandra goes to visit her.  Melissa is gone without a word, but abandoned her six month old baby that she had shown so much love.  With her own fussy infant at her side, Cassandra wonders what happened to her new friend while unable to contact Stephen, dealing with the abrupt arrival of her first husband, and Detective Sergeant Vickers suspecting the professor killed the actress.\n\nSTAGE FRIGHT, the second Professor James tale (see MURDER IS ACADEMIC), is a fabulous amateur sleuth mystery that builds up the suspense slowly so that the reader like the heroine suspects everyone's motives.  Either foul play occurred or Melissa had played the role of a loving mother, but Cassandra cannot find a motive for either scenario while the evidence points towards her so that even the audience will believe she harmed or murdered the actress.  This is a fantastic English mystery in the Christie tradition.\n\nHarriet Klausner\n"

aS'\tA Solid Defense\n\tThe Gospel of Judas has had its fifteen minutes of fame. It is but another in an endlessly long line of stories or documents meant to shake the foundations of the Christian faith. Like its many predecessors, it gave National Geographic and anti-Christian authors an opportunity to voice their dissension with the biblical story of Jesus. A book titled The Gospel of Judas shot to near the top of the bestsellers lists and nearly as quickly, shot straight back down. Still, while its popularity was short-lived, it allowed Bart Ehrman and other revisionists a chance to laud the epistle for its new insights into the life of Christ. Surely Ehrman forever cast doubt upon his credibility as a historian when he blathered, "(The Gospel of Judas) is one of the greatest historical discoveries of the twentieth century. It rivals the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Gnostic Gospels of Nag Hammadi."\n\nNational Geographic describes the importance of the document in this way: "The Gospel of Judas gives a different view of the relationship between Jesus and Judas, offering new insights into the disciple who betrayed Jesus. Unlike the accounts in the canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, in which Judas is portrayed as a reviled traitor, this newly discovered Gospel portrays Judas as acting at Jesus\' request when he hands Jesus over to the authorities." A classically dualistic, gnostic document, The Gospel of Judas presents a Jesus who is seeking to escape from the corruption of this physical world and asks Judas to betray Him so He can be free of this wickedness. Judas complies and shows himself to be a hero, rather than a villain. No longer the betrayer, He is a faithful friend to Jesus Christ.\n\nRenowned New Testament scholar N.T. Wright is the first Christian to my knowledge to write a thorough refutation of the teachings of The Gospel of Judas. Judas and the Gospel of Jesus is due for publication in October of 2006 and will be published by Baker Books. It is a short book, weighing in at only 144 pages, but provides a thorough treatment of the subject matter.\n\nWright is fair to this newly published document. He does not say that there is no value in The Gospel of Judas for surely there is, for it tells us much about the gnosticism that was a great opponent of early Christianity. It gives historians access to an authentic, original document. But it tells us nothing about the real Jesus and the real Judas. Those who would have us believe that this letter provides details about the real life of the real Jesus can be little more than revisionists. Wright shows that such people believe in what he calls "the new myth of Christian origins." This myth, popularized by men such as Bart Ehrman, has three main teachings: first, Jesus was not as the canonical gospels portray Him; second, there were a great many different varieties of early Christianity, and they produced a large number of different "gospels," all of which circulated among Christians more or less unchecked; third, when Christianity became consolidated in the fourth century, many teachings about the "true" Christian faith were rejected.\n\n"Classic Christianity," he says, "has a lot more life and promise than have ever been imagined by those who propose the new Myth, or by those who offer newly discovered gnostic texts as the panacea for our ills. It is a shame that the churches have been so muzzled, so often self-blinded to the full dimensions of the gospel they profess, the gospel of Jesus himself."\n\nThrough this short book, Wright asks good questions and insightfully shows where The Gospel of Judas simply cannot be held as equal in any way to Scripture. He shows himself to be a New Testament scholar the equal of any involved in promoting this new gospel. While the document appears to be genuine, it is little different and little more significant than the multitudes of other gnostic writings which have come down to us, even two millenia later.\n\nIt is perhaps somewhat ironic that N.T. Wright, who has reimagined and reinvented many of the teachings of Paul (and thus Jesus), would be the first to make a stand for the truth against others who would seek to reinvent Jesus. Unfortunately, Wright\'s New Perspectives are glimpsed, even if only dimly, through much of the text of this book. Still, he offers a compelling response to Ehrman and others and one well worth reading. I would tend to believe that, for most people, The Gospel of Judas is best ignored. It offers little that would be of interest to the average person. For those who do have interest in it, Judas and the Gospel of Jesus will no doubt prove an interesting response to the irrational views espoused by those who wish to reinvent Christianity and to cast doubt upon Scripture\n'

aS"\tGreat!, if you're a Carolina fan...terrific if you're not!\n\tOn the way to a conference in New Orleans, my flight from Raleigh to Charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems, and I was booked on a flight to D.C. As I boarded the plane with  quot;The Carolina Way quot; under my arm, a gentleman seated at the front of the plane asked how I was enjoying the book.  I explained that I had not yet started the book, so I could not give an answer.  The gentleman followed me to my seat and introduced himself as Dr. Gerald Bell, the co-author of  quot;The Carolina Way quot;.  Myself a Carolina fan, I was pleased to meet Dr. Bell, as he spent several minutes talking about Coach Smith, whom I have admired for over forty years, and the UNC basketball program, which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under Coach Roy Williams. Dr. Bell's contributions to the book tie Coach Smith's leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from Carolina's storied history to today's business situations.  Surely, Coach Smith, given his ability to recruit top players, has been criticized by many for his failure to win NCAA championships in the manner of Coach John Wooden at UCLA, but winning two NCAA championships, winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict NCAA rules, and coaching top players that graduated at a +90% rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of Coach Smith's  quot;system quot;.  Teamwork, integrity, loyalty, and hard work, are the cornerstones of the Carolina Way, and anyone in the position of managing, leading, or molding young people today would benefit from reading this book, corny as it is at times.  This book is not just for Carolina basketball fans\n"

aS"\tFascinating look at America 50 years ago\n\tJohn Gunther's INSIDE U.S.A. comes as close to time travel as we are likely to get, hurling us back to the America of 1947, as he explores, state by state, the people, politics, issues, passions and fads that make up our country.  Written with great energy and insight, Gunther captures an America justly proud of its WWII success, still unsure of its role in the world, and populated by fascinating characters like Mayor LaGuardia of New York, Governor Saltonstall of Massachusetts and Boss Hague of Jersey City.  Gunther describes regional characteristics that persist today.  He captures aspects of America that are gone,l never to return (an  quot;industrial quot; nation based on coal, iron ore and steel.)  And he foresees issues that dog America to this day -- the  quot;Negro problem quot; (actually, the  quot;White problem. quot;)  He condemns the segregationist society he finds in America, so inconsistent with its lofty ideals.  As you can tell, I loved this book.  It's very hefty -- but every time you are about to put it down, Gunther comes up with another amazing fact or interesting sidelight that keeps you reading.  All this said, Gunther does concentrate on the (a) historical, (b) political and (c) economic side of things.  You won't find much here about the arts or science.  But it is amazing a single individual could have compiled this much data and presented it so interestingly\n"
