<reviews><review>Thank you thank you thank you !! I  want to thank the people that made this place happen ....you have made all my dreams come true. Imagine a delicious yogurt shop with super fun flavors like peanut butter, chocolate mint, cake batter and so many more.  I used to have to travel to  Yogurtland or Jujuberry  but not anymore , now we have one right in the hood!! Guess what?   instead of eating a normal lunch I can pig out with a healthy peanut butter yogurt smothered in chocolate chips.   Could be the perfect lunch!!  See you there!

<review>A Humane Society store at the Biltmore?  Interesting.  I had seen an adorable chihuahua mix at the Humane Society's webpage, and headed over to check out the little dog and the store.  They sell a variety of toys, treats, leashes, collars, and foods- in short, they sell a little bit of everything.  There's no tax, and if you adopt a pet from them they will give you 10% off the price as a thank you.  When I went there were 4 dogs up for adoption, a rabbit, and a wall of cats.  The little chihuahua mix was hanging out in the store with another little dog, so we got to play with them for a little bit.  The staff were friendly, and weren't pushy or hovering.  \n\nIn the end, we did end up adopting that little chihuahua mix from here.  He's the sweetest little dog ever.  Thank you Petique!

<review>The tire pressure light came on a day or so ago, so I had my husband fill the tire with more air. Took it down to Discount Tire this morning, and apparently I ran over a hunk of metal a few days ago. Although it was pretty busy in there, they fit me in and had my tire repaired in about 30-35 minutes. Cost = $0. Totally awesome. And they didn't try to sell me new tires! Love that. \n\nPlus one of the technicians in the garage was singing so loudly to Lady Gaga that he could be heard in the waiting area. Very entertaining. :)

<review>Good Pizza and great service!!\nThe date dinner for two special is great for its value, available on Thursdays after 6:00 pm!!!\n It included an entree, two salads and one pizza of your choice!!! \nEnough food for two!!! :) The garlic french fries were bomb!!!! Deliciously seasoned. As for our friend, the birthday boy, he had pepperoni pizza and that by itself was great, better than our BBQ Chicken pizza I would say!!\n Fun place, great service, AWESOME YOUNG MAN SERVING!!! :) We came here with a group of 12 and were seated urgently and smoothly!! :) Oh and the Pomegranate Martini was Oh soo Great!!! A must try, a bit strong, but that's how I like them!! :)

<review>Found this place looking for a taqueria on line. I wanted authentic mexican food. NOT taco bell! I found exactly what I was looking for. I got the Carne Asada burrito. It was bigger then Chipolte's for $2.00 less! The asada was very good and lean, no fat. I was staying in the area for 5 days and found myself eating here four times! Very friendly service and clean. My son said he knew it was going to be good even before we walked in because of the mexican music playing outside, and he was right! TAQUERIA MI CASITA ROCKS!  I will definately find my way back here again.

<review>I was so excited when I saw this place opening. We moved here from California so this was yet another thing we left behind. Fortunately all our favorites are slowly following us here. Eventually California will fall into the ocean and we'll have beach front property and we'll be set. I digress. \n\nThis BevMo particularly is really well stocked and large. Larger than a lot of California ones and the people here are all really helpful. If they don't have something in stock, they can order it for you and get it in pretty quick. They used to have a great bar in it with wine and beer tastings but it's gone now. Some problem with licensing - I'm assuming liquor license. I can empathize with the bureaucracy. I just filed our quarterly taxes and its driven me to drink - hence BevMo.\n\nEven if you have nothing in particular to buy, take a walk through. It's like Disneyland for adults. Unless you're a Mormon. Then it may not be for you. But if you're not, it's great. (Special bonus - HUGE selection of tiny liquor bottles to stash for lame dry wedding or to keep on hand for general times that require tiny bottles of booze.)

<review>"""This was also my first play, sad I know! Although I missed the first half of \The Clean House\"""" I was lucky enough to find someone that caught me up to speed! We got seated on the lower level left balcony very close as soon as I sat down I pretty much laughed thru the rest of the play, it was a great story! I had no idea there was cussing in the theatre! The cast was excellent, I am also a fan of Felicity La Fortune (Lani) she appeared in a soap I used to watch I thought she was fantastic!! I missed the Wicked Bakery  and  Gelato spot stuff afterward's no worry's Wicked is near by and I am planning a visit soon, like tomorrow lol! Seeing the play was a treat all by itself a good time was had! Thank you Yelp and Gabi!!"""""""

<review>Carlsbad Tavern is my favorite Mexican restaurant. I love the dark and cozy atmosphere inside and I love that they have Hoegaarden on tap.. I've had the machaca burrito and fish tacos here and both dishes were amazing. They serve New Mexico cuisine here. The only difference I noticed is they are big on green chile and use black beans instead of refried beans. I have a lot of friends from New Mexico and they all love this restaurant. The food here is delicious and flavorful if you don't live in the neighborhood it's definitely worth the drive.

<review>I like Chinese food. When I lived in San Francisco, I lived in the Inner Richmond (before it was run over by the Hiptards, when it was a fun Chinese neighborhood), and would go to various restaurants with a friend, Chinese, so we got taken care of all the time.\n\nNow in LA, it's more about Korean and Thai, but I still love my Chinese food.\n\nI flew in to see the parents, and we headed over to Joyful for dinner. The parents have been there a few times, and a friend of theirs is a NY'er who is fanatical about his Chinese food, and he goes once a week. \n\nSpoke to the wait staff, from Hong Kong and Macau via Vietnam and then Los Angeles. They have Cantonese and Mandarin style, as well as a few Thai and curry dishes.\n\nWe ordered egg rolls, vegetable egg rolls, vegetable egg foo young, beef chow mein and chicken moo shu. All were amazingly good, and fresh. That's the key: really, really fresh.\n\nThe chow mein noodles were homemade, nice and fresh. The beef was a nice quality, and thick pieces.\n\nThe moo shu, for me, was the best. They hand roll the crepes in the back, coming out in tightly wound roll. The chicken and vegetables were nice and fresh, white meat. And the extra hoison sauce was perfect.\n\nAnd they give you almond cookies and fortune cookies at the end, which isn't really Chinese but who cares. :)\n\nAll in all, it's a four and half star place. The fifth star, however, is to offset Lauren. Sorry you didn't get utensils, but really the food is much better than 2 stars. And, the hotel should have been able to supply you with fork, knife and spoon ... just tip the bell boy $2 and you would have been set.
</review>
<review>AMAZING FOOD! Yes there is a long wait (2-3 Hours sometimes) but if you can't find any friends that you would like to spend a few hours with next door at the bar drinking wine and eating a cheese platter and some olives, then maybe you should just call for delivery and stay in your cave.  The ingredients are minimal on your pizza but you can' TASTE the freshness, and that beats all greasy and heavy pizza in my book! So come prepared to wait, but Bar Bianco, which is less than 20 steps away will help entertain you while you wait. Food and service are exceptional!

<review>Last night we attended the  summer night time activities for kids held on Fridays  form 6-9 during the summer. We had a great time, the kids had water  blow up slides to play on , water play , Phoenix Youth theater acts, \nfun  family music.   They have only one more Friday left this summer, so come out and have fun. There was a lovely breeze by about 7:00  and the sun  stopped heating it up. \n\nAlways love the zoo, they seem to be getting more and more exhibits and animals.  I recommend going at the beginning of the day or end of the day. That's when many animals come out to play , feed and  water. \nLast  night we  saw the family of wild dogs playing and hanging out  also saw the cheetahs which was  a treat , they usually hide to camouflage .\n\nThe zoo is equipped with clean bathrooms, lots of places  for breaks and hanging out. We have had two birthday parties there and the kids loved it. \n\nThe kids wanted a ride on the tram which was nice in the evening , we learned new facts from the guide and a little about the Zoo's work on keeping many animals from becoming extinct.\n\nMy 9 year old and my best friends 10 year old have been coming here since they were 2 and 3 . They love coming here and never seem to tire of it\n\n We visit the zoo about every two months just to check out what the animals are doing.  You can bring in your own food, wagons, bikes and stay all day . For little ones there is a huge tree house to play in  and a water splash place for summer.

<review>"""Regency has been in Ahwatukee for as long as I can remember, and I've been here a long time!  The staff is super friendly; they recognize me as soon as I walk in the door and even know who my parents are (who have been going there forever) and tell me that they stopped in earlier in the week.  They do alterations too!\n\nThe prices are a little high, this isn't your $2/item dry cleaner.  I've used those places before and I believe you get what you pay for.  For example, they look for spots/stains before they clean my clothes, I don't have to call special attention to them.  Regency catches the stains that I miss!!  The $2 place never did that!\n\nAlso, they use earth friendly cleaning products/process.  To me that makes my money worth it and it also makes me think twice before getting something dry cleaned.  \Can I get one more wear out of those dress pants?  Its not like I went hiking in them . . . yeah, I can wait.\""""\n\nAs we've all heard before, we vote with our dollars, and I vote for the local, friendly dry cleaner that cares about the planet!"""""""

<review>"""Service and food is excellent.  $3.99 for a good sized burrito served with rice and beans on the side is a great deal.  Or 99 cent tacos (these are the Mexico \street\"""" style ones served on a soft flat corn tortilla).  All their food is very authentic.\n\nThe Al Pastor (seasoned grilled pork and onions) is my favorite and is the best I've ever had.  Whether it's in a burrito, taco or torta, I absolutely love it.  The sodas are the kind you'd get in Mexico.. they import them in the glass bottles.  I've always liked these better than the plastic bottle type you get in the states. The Mexican ones are sweeter and less carbonated.\n\nGreat place, and they have beer too."""""""
</review>
<review>"""Let's talk about the good things at Moto.\n\n1. Beer. The owner (who splits his time between CO and AZ) doesn't mess around with \typical\"""" beers. You won't find Budweiser, Miller, Coors, Heineken, Corona or any of their \""""lite\"""" varieties. Usual beers found on tap are from Four Peaks (local brewery), Stone Brewing (San Diego), Avery Brewing (Boulder, CO) and various other craft brewing companies. \n\nAlong with the beer comes an in-frequent \""""beer celebration\"""" held at Moto. This happens for Stone Brewing Anniversaries along with other random events. Usually advertised on tables a few weeks prior to the event. \n\n\n2. Non-sushi menu items. There is a good selection of pre-made bowls along with a make your own bowl option. I consider all of these bowls to be \""""to-go\"""" options, I can never finish a full bowl (I'm 6'3\"""" and 200+ lbs, to give you an idea of my size/appetite). Also, the buffalo burger and salmon entrees are good sized and won't break the bank.\n\nI've had every appetizer available on the menu and can say that they are all good to excellent. The spring rolls come with a wonderful sweet sauce. The chicken quesadillas are large and filling. The asian nachos are piled high.\n\n\n3. Desert - The \""""Mojos\"""" are probably one of the best frozen deserts I've ever had. Ice cream wrapped in rice crispy treats. The ice cream can change daily, the servers usually do not know what flavor it will be. The menu states this as well.\n\n\n4. The \""""Underground\"""" menu. This is the menu of specialty rolls that are made. These clock in at $12 each and are very good. The Jalapenko is spicy and very filling for an 8 piece serving. \n\n\n5. The \""""all you can eat\"""" on Saturday. This is both good and bad. The good is that yes, you can get all you can eat (of the available sushi, not everything is on this special). The bad is that once it gets busy you will need to wait for your items, Moto runs two sushi chefs max. If you expect 20 orders of 5+ sushi items to come out in 5-10 minutes, you need to come back to reality. Get there early and order in a timely manner, be prepared.\n\n\nAnd now the downside:\n\n1. Sushi - The regular menu has, in comparison to other sushi bars, a very small selection. As mentioned in earlier reviews, only smoked salmon for some items rather than regular salmon. The sushi available is of good size without the \""""rice bloat\"""" that some sushi bars have, you know what I mean, when the roll has more rice than contents (fish/veggies/seaweed or soy wrap). I recommend ordering a regular roll, such as spicy tuna and an \""""underground\"""" roll (mentioned above).\n\n\n2. Wait time and servers - This is a neighborhood restaurant, through and through this is how the owner markets the establishment and runs it. If it is very busy you will need to wait for a table. You will need to wait for your order to be prepared longer if it is busy.\n\n\n\nThat's all I have to offer you in the way of advice and opinion on Moto. Overall it is above average when factoring in the experience and goal of the restaurant. I wouldn't call it a \""""sushi experience\"""", but rather a nice sushi restaurant in a good neighborhood. Go to have a nice lunch or dinner, or to watch a game and drink some great beers."""""""

<review>We Finlay made it to St Francis. My girlfriend and I came here for dinner New Years eve for dinner before heading to a party. We both went with the 3 course meal that night. She got the salad that had thinly slice grapefruit and a light but tasty vinaigrette. I choose the lobster bisque. This lobster bisque was so good except one thing, they put thinly sliced pecans in it. This is not a place for nuts. I had a few bites of it before I got the pecans and it was delicious. Once i chewed the nuts it coated my mouth and that was all I could taste for the rest of the bowl. Leave the nuts out next time it was so good!!! Course #2 She got the scallops. Freakin awsome and cooked to perfection! I have never had a scallop cook so perfect ever. Props to who ever was cooking the scallops that night! I ordered the fillet. I ordered it med rare and it was more like med+ and I took one bite and decided to keep it cause it was delicious and they were busy and didn't want to wait 15 min for another. I usually would have sent it back but the flavor was there and the veggies that came with were excellent. For the desserts she got pear dessert with ice cream. Freakin awsome. Great thing to have for cleansing the palate after all that great food. I got the Chocolate turtle dessert that was great but we took that home for later. The building is cool and for the firs timers the waiter gives you a little history about the building before ordering. Great service and great food. We will be back and cant wait to see whats on the menu next time we stop by!

<review>Uncle Bear's is one of the best things about Queen Creek! \n\nThe food is actually decent pub grub. The vibe is laid back, festive, friendly, and warm. The locals that frequent the place are definitely life of the party. The dog wall of fame is very sweet. The RIP wall made me tear up for my recently lost dog. When you're in this joint, you feel dinstinctly like you're in a beach town in San Diego, rather than a tiny suburb in AZ. \n\nI recommend you swing by. If you come a few times, everyone will know you and you'll feel like you're walking into a really fun living room.
</review>
<review>Really Nice inside... not your typical Courtyard.\n\nHad a bit of The W feel but it was bright and airy inside.\n\nThe rooms were really nice and the bed was super comfy.\nAlso, the bathroom.... the sink is outside from the shower and toilet.... which makes it easier for 2 people to use the bathroom at the same time.\n\nThey also offer complimentary WiFi which is very convenient.\n\nI didn't get to enjoy the cafe downstairs but it looked good.\n\nThe front desk folks were nice and efficient.  Got the 4 of us and our 3 rooms organized and checked-in in a matter of minutes.

<review>"""My husband and I came here after hiking Camelback Mountain. We were hungry and wanted some hearty diner food and totally found it in Joe's.\n\nTwo eggs poached for me. Perfect, especially for $0.99. My husband had the corned beef hash covered in two fried eggs with a side of chorizo gravy and biscuts. The hash was as he puts it so well: \Tastes like it's out of a can, just like I like it.\"""" The eggs were cooked well. The only negative was the biscuit. Like good southerners, we're a little picky and it was a little doughy for our taste. But the chorizo gravy is a must. Delicious, and I know my gravy.\n\nThe service is friendly, quick, and attentive. We'd definitely come back next time we're in the area."""""""

<review>Oh...my...lanta! I can't believe I haven't visited this little gem sooner! It's nestled atop a Pei Wei and Starbucks so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But from the moment I walked up the dimly light stairway and into the bar, I knew it was going to be a great night.  So first off, they open at 4 and happy hour is until 7pm.  (20% off everything on Sundays!!). They have a huge selection of different booze and brews and their specialty cocktails are definitely something that sets them apart from other bars.  I loves me some Moscow Mule, so when I saw that they had one on the menu (in a real copper mug!!) I ordered one immediately.  It was so tastilicious that I had to order a second.  For my next drink, I tried the Retro Cooler, which in my opinion, is as cool as it gets...think Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused.  It's a mix of St. Germaine (Elderflower liquer) with Champagne and a lemon twist.  It went down the ole' hatch super easy, though, so be careful!  The second time I enjoyed this bar I ordered the White Rabbit (no...it's not vegan and they don't have a milk substitute...I cheated!)  It has Godiva White Chocolate liquer, horchata, stoli vanilla and some other yumness.  This one tasted like candy and I drank it in about five seconds.  Anyway, besides the drinks, they also have a few light snacks like hummus, artichoke dip, etc.  The vibe in this place is super chill and I really dig the way the bar is set up; the backdrop has big circle cutouts with yellow lights behind. There are comfy couches and high top tables and of course seats at the bar.  I almost felt like I was going to see Shane and Alice from the L Word walk in.  On our last visit, it was pretty busy as it was a holiday weekend and there was a dj.  The people of SideBar definitely know what they're doing and I will certainly be back!
</review>
<review>Love this place!\n\nI'm vegetarian, but my friends and family aren't. It's great that True Food has plenty of options for both, plus those who are gluten free. I highly recommend the TLT sandwich (tempeh, lettuce, tomato) with sweet potato hash or the hummus plate. The hummus plate is enough for your main meal or to be shared with 2-4 people.\n\nThe pricing is decent--it's what you're going to pay anywhere else in Scottsdale. The only time I had an issue with the service was when they first opened and had snobby hostesses, but I haven't had that problem again. The weekend wait at night can get annoying, but at least they offer free wifi to pass the time.
</review>
<review>OHHHHHHHHHH BABY!!!! I love me some InNOut Burger.  Growing up in Arizona we didn't have InNOut Burger, so when we went to So Cal to visit family, the daily trips to InNOut were like mini vacations within our vacation.  You can imagine how happy I was when they started opening them in the Valley.\n\nI absolutely love this place.  Try something off the secret menu.  3x3, 4x4, animal style, well done fries... grilled cheese! yup!\n\nThe service is always good, the restaurants are always clean, and the food is always fresh.  Can't ask for much more.
</review>
<review>Basically this is a place offers some real frozen yogurt, unlike so many other stores offers ice cream but titled as 'frozen yogurt' to be in the trend. Bliss's froyo actually has the sour, tart yogurt taste, and you can feel the lightness! I love the original flavor, and don't like toppings on it. I always get a big one to go, and put in the freezer when I can't finish it, and it still tastes the same on the next day, or tastes even better after you freeze them according to my roommate.\n\nAnyways, this is a great place for some real froyo. Just be sure to look to a corner store next to the Bank of America on Mill, cuz its kinda hidden in the brickyard.

<review>WOW!  This is a beautiful Spring Training stadium!  I was able to attend the Season Opener of the D-backs and Rockies and loved this place. It did take what seemed forever to get a parking and I am sure that they have worked out the kinks.  The lawn seating covers the entire outfield and is the best place to watch a game.  The food was fantastic!  There were so many choices.  I decided to go with some fry bread and I was not disappointed.  My next visit I will have to try out Salty's or Native New Yorker.  I did get to spy on a celebrity...Gonzo was signing some autographs for some lucky fans!  I loved the selections of micro brews that are available at the stadium.  I like that this stadium has sunblock stands available courtesy of CHC.   I can't wait to watch several more games at this stadium during spring training!
</review>
<review>This is such a nice getaway from the pretentious, overpriced Old Town places crawling with posers. \n\nHands down the best margarita in town. Nice happy hour with good drink specials. Overall, nice ambiance, good music and not too loud. \n\nThe food is pretty good too. Good soups, nice apps, (tres hummus plate is very good - veggies instead of pita is a nice, healthy touch). Arizona fire corn is unique and delicious, and the sweet potato fries are a winner.\n\nFor the entrees, if you like fish, the Pescado Veracruz is very flavorful. Also, the sonoran veggie wrap was good- but DRY, which is too bad because the sonoran sauce is delicious. Here is a hint:  you need to put it on the whole wrap, not just on the last bite! I must say I was looking forward to the Rocky Point Pizza and was a little disappointed. I expected shrimp on the pizza, not shrimp flavored puree. It was still good, but not special.\n\nFinally, this is just a nice place to chill out at the bar after a long day without obstreperous music and irritating patrons.
</review>
<review>This is a very nice superstore for all you homemaking needs....but I think what set's it apart from stores like Hobby Lobby.....and Michaels is that they offer free classes to show you how make you home more beautiful. I mean everything from sewing your own curtains....to making arts and crafts to decorate your home....and did I mention it is all FREE. Can't be that.....so get over to Joann's and get your homemaking on people. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends

<review>A perfect way to top of an exotic shopping experience at 99 Ranch.  The Taiwan Express has photos of many (not all) of their dishes. Very authentic.  \n\nAlso try some shaved ice for desert (brought me back to Singapore!).  My kids love the shaved ice, though they are more used to Asian foods than most kids.  \n\nNote that the Buffet section (to the left) is better than any mall food courts, and may be more tame for some taste buds.  \n\nAND - in between the buffet and Taiwan Express you can buy a whole roast duck for about $12.50, which they will cut up for you.  Be sure to buy some Plum Sauce (elsewhere in the store) for a sweet dipping sauce for the duck (yummy!).

<review>This past weekend, I finally had a chance to try the brunch at Postino on Central. I went as part of Smunch, my monthly brunch meetup. I was really looking forward to this, as the reviews I'd read were glowing, and Postino did not disappoint!\n\nI started brunch with a delightful peach bellini, and my wife and I shared an order of walnut toast with brie and fresh berry compote. The berries and brie were a fantastic combination and the bread was yummy, toasted lightly to add a bit of crunch.\n\nI had the French toast, which I'd heard from Georgie S. was good enough to bathe in. It lived up to its reputation, as it was warm and soft inside without being too well done on the outside. It was served with creme fraiche, berry compote and sliced strawberries. It was an altogether delightful take on a breakfast classic.\n\nFinally, I finished the morning with a glass of honey cucumber lemonade and a cup of coffee. The lemonade was absolutely wonderful, light and refreshing. I'm sure it's magic during the hot summer months, but even with the winter weather I found it enjoyable. The coffee is from Lola Coffee a local coffeehouse and roaster. It was slightly more bitter than I prefer, but I accept that I'm an unrepentant coffee snob, so I rate it as perfectly acceptable for a restaurant setting.\n\nFinally, I have to commend Postino for handling the 30+ Smunch attendees very well. Troy (the manager) had set up four tables, but the group quickly expanded to seven. The staff, especially our excellent server Jenny handled everything with grace and a smile. I was also impressed that the kitchen staff was able to turn out so many simultaneous orders while keeping the quality high.\n\nThe only problem was with figuring out the bill. Instead of doing separate checks or checks per table, we had three or four checks which each contained the orders for several people, but we weren't sure whose was whose. In the end, we got it handled, and since this was a special situation, I didn't feel that it should take away from the five stars I feel Postino deserves.\n\nOverall, Postino brunch is a resounding success!

<review>This is a small family owned sub shop that's been in the same plaza in this older part of Mesa for over 30 years. This is the original but they've since expanded all over Mesa. You'll find them tucked next to the Dirty Drummer bar on the corner in the same plaza as Wendy's. It can be hard to spot if you're not looking for it. \n\nThey have brightly colored booth seating right when you enter. A few feet back is the counter to order. Depending on what time of day, you'll either see the owner working, his family, or your typical high school kids.\n\nI've always enjoyed their subs, whether it was as a young child or on lunch break long ago in high school. What I enjoy most is their meat selection and the fact that they have a generous helping of not too tart italian dressing and mayo on their subs. The combination is hard to describe but when it's done right, it tastes unlike any other sub.Their bread is soft and fluffy and they leave out the million and a half vegetables you'll get at other places, making it a true sandwich- not just a bunch of vegetables on bread. You can get your sandwich hot or cold and they have reasonably priced lunch specials btwn. 10 AM - 2 PM where you can get an 8 or 12 inch sub, drink, chips or pickle for between $4.63 - $5.23  They also do catering.\n\nPersonally I think the Poorboy is one of the best with Salami, Spiced Ham, Bologna,  and  Provolone Cheese. I would never think of putting those meats together, let alone eat them by themselves, but for some reason they make it work. I love Krazy Sub :)

<review>I like this airport, it's huge. I usually dislike oversized hubs but I like Phoenix. It's layout is friendly and organized, the long, flat, escalators make you feel like your super-human-power-walking, love it.\n\nIt has a ton of shopping and good bars. I think there is 11 jewelry stores in the airport alone, which would suck if it were anywhere else, but when your in Arizona your in the Mecca of awesome craft jewelry masters from all the local Native American tribes. That do amazing turquoise and silver work. \n\nHighly airconditioned so bring your hoodie. Barfly is a decent bar for a cold cocktail.

<review>For a municipal course, Dobson Ranch is tops.  This is the place to go for a good, cheap afternoon round of golf during the summer.  It's a well maintained traditional course, with large trees lining the fairways, and grass everywhere.  Dobson Ranch is great for beginners, as the ball is playable from anywhere that is not in someone's backyard.  It's slice-friendly too, with most of the out of bounds areas sitting to the left of the fairways.\n\nDobson Ranch is a standard par 72, except instead of having 4 par 3s, 10 par 4s, and 4 par 5s; it has 5 par 3s, 8 par 4s, and 5 par 5s.\n\nAt only $10 to walk on a summer afternoon, this is one of the best values in the Valley.

<review>I used to be anti-Cold Stone, but I've changed my stance since moving nearby and getting it way too often due to my girlfriend's cravings. Yeah, that's it, I'll blame her for our weekly visits. We started going to this location about a year ago and the trend always seemed to be pissed off, teenage high school girls with neck tattoos behind the counter hatefully making your ice cream. It was especially nice when they felt the need to complain about their miserable lives to the customers. But ya know, I learned something from one of them one day. It sounds to me it was the owner or manager of this location that was the bane of these poor girls' existence. So ya know what, I'm on their side now. \n\nBut that used to be the trend. Over the past few months there seems to be a happier group of girls working who don't have neck tattoos. They are more upbeat, positive, and don't complain. They make damn good Gotta Have It sized specialty ice cream bowls. Enjoy!

<review>Great dim sum!  Go on Sunday for brunch/lunch!\n\nFavorites that I always order:\nShrimp dumplings\nBean curd rolls\nShrimp or beef noodle wraps\nSnow buns for dessert\n\nIf you're brave, try the chicken feet.  It's a traditional plate that is delicious as long as you can get over the fact that you're eating feet.  If you're Asian, you should have been born over it.  haha\n\nDrink tea with your dim sum!  It's not right any other way.\n\nThe owner/manager comes around during dim sum time to make sure you got all the goodies you wanted.  If not, he goes and grabs it from the cart especially for you!  How nice of him!\n\nI've been here for dim sum, with one occasion for dinner.  Everything was tasty!  There aren't as many traditional choices that would be found in the bay area or LA (California), but this is the best place in the Pheonix/Mesa area for Chinese food so far.

<review>McGraths in Scottsdale is CLOSED!!!!!\n\nThe wife and I actually stepped in for lunch here today and they have a pretty affordable lunch menu. We both had halibut and shrimp fried with french fries. very good stuff! The Cole Slaw is also very good, creamy and flavorful. Coming from the Pacific North West I am very particular about fish. This halibut was white, solid and flaky. I'll be trying out the Soup and Salad next time. Gotta' have good clam chowder or it just aint' a fish house!
</review>
<review>My parents and I love Marjerle's. Their happy hour is good, love the wings. We end up going there and we all just get wings! The fried shrimp are great, and the brownie dessert is decadent and good. We've been here for trivia night and we won a $5 gift card, the emcee was funny and it was a nice way to spend a night! Great place to watch UFC or whatever game you like to see. Service is good, all the waitresses I've had have doted on us. Great sports bar, it'll always be one of our regular spots!

<review>"""WHY did I not order a Stetson Chopped Salad for myself instead of opting to share it with my girl?! BAD BAD choice, on my part. Once again, after 2+ years of not having one, it blew my boots off.\n\nWe made reservations and they seated us as we walked in the door at our appointed time.\n\nOur server, Gabe, was extraordinary- attentive and on the ball.\n\nWe split the Stetson Chopped, had an order of \Crispy Mac N Cheese\"""" and the BBQ ribs with the cherry BBQ sauce. The mac n cheeze was okay, a little dry, though they did provide a nice salsa thingy to moisten it up. The ribs n cherry sauce, OMG!!!\n\nWish they would sell the Stetson Chopped and ship it to me in San Diego... I am sure they would for a price, eh? I'll let you know how that day goes."""""""

<review>"""I can't believe I've lived in the East Valley for 2+ years and only just heard of this place!  My 4 year-old son and I visited today and had a fantastic 2 hours - free from whining and complaining - and FREE of charge!\n\nThis is a great spot to take kids ages 2 - 12 on a hot summer day for cheap, educational entertainment  (I'd say the sweet spot is ages 3 - 8).  There are 2 separate areas, one designed for kids under 5 and the other for 5 - 12 (but I saw kids from 2 - 12 in both areas).  The younger side features large, soft stacking blocks, bouncy horses to ride, a large  and  well-stocked play kitchen and living room, a play stage, and a coloring area.  \n\nThe 5+ side has at least 8 different craft areas to create different projects with tons of mixed media, glue, pipe cleaners - you name it.  There are puzzles and cutouts to stack and create art sculptures, a vet's office with lab coats, scales, and stuffed pets, animal costumes + a video screen, a sticker project, origami art room, musical instruments, and I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting.  There are also live animals in the \Extreme Pet\"""" exhibit I'm told - but the schedule wasn't posted online and they weren't there on our visit.\n\nThe first Sunday of every month is free from 12pm to 5pm and there is ample free parking on the street and in city lots.  Some of the complaints from previous reviewers don't make a lot of sense to me, but to each their own.  My son had a great time and can't wait to go back!"""""""

<review>First time here a week ago. The atmosphere is fantastic ! We came during dinner (around 630PM) and the place was packed but everyone was friendly and so was the service.\n\nWe ordered 4 different bruschettas. I was originally intending on ordering a panini, but one of my sorority sisters suggested otherwise. A few other sisters vouched for their bruschetta, so the bf and I didn't think we'd go wrong there. All of the different kinds we tried were delicious! So much that we ordered another 4 with our 2 favorites. Can't go wrong... just pick one! Or 4... since they come served that way.\n\nI wasn't feeling wine that night for some strange reason, but their cucumber lemonade was sooooooooo refreshing. Yes, that many O's.\n\nNew favorite stop-by-when-we're-in-town place.
</review>
<review>Mojo was delish. I had the original tart. It was very good. I didn't like the chocolate chip cookie dough topping. That was disappointing. I also tried the raspberry which was pretty good too. It was your run of the mill self serve yogurt. \n\nWhat I found interesting was how many people would serve themselves a taste and keep going back for freebies. Wow, I saw a whole family do that. It made me laugh yet I was embarrassed at the same time!
</review>
<review>I don't understand anyone not loving this place.  It destroys Honey Bears and Big City BBQ.  The guy who owns the place resembles Michael Clarke Duncan and is extraordinarily friendly.  He gives us free sodas often and used to break my balls when I wasn't over-the-top gentlemanly with my girlfriend.\n\nThe food is relatively expensive, but he gives you a large volume.  You'd have to be a big boy to finish the entire thing in a sitting.  The brisket melts in your mouth.  The rib meat falls off the bone like it was never attached.  Yes, it's fairly greasy, but the food is absolutely delicious.  The sides aren't anything special, but they are good.  The meat earns this place five stars, along with the character of the guy who owns the place.\n\nThe atmosphere is somewhat minimal, but I actually like it for that.  It's just a simple bbq place.  You get jars for your drinks, and the tables have traditional picnic table cloths.
</review>
<review>"""This is one of my very favorite stores in the Valley!  The first thing I always do, is make my way to the back to the grocery section.  They've got foods from all over the world (that you won't find at TJ's or AJ's) and delicacies that take me back to my travels.\nNext, I do the wall decor.  I've gotten some really cool iron hangings for my living room.  \nNext, the furniture!  I have been shopping for bedroom furniture for 2 months and I always make my way to Cost Plus World Market.  The prices are REALLY reasonable (and it's real wood!) and they have a delivery option.  \nI call the style of this store \funky urban\"""".  I prefer it over Pier 1."""""""
</review>
<review>"""It had been a while since I've been to Cherry Blossom, so I didn't feel good about reviewing it until I tried it again recently.  It was just as good as I remembered.  The service is a tad slow and it is pretty smoky inside, so you run the risk of smelling like garlic and wok oil all day if you eat in.  But take out is always an option.  \n\nI had a noodle soup with \mountain vegetables\"""" and fatty udon noodles.  Mountain vegetables?  WTF?  The server didn't even know what the were but they tasted good.  \n\nTwo thumbs up."""""""
</review>
<review>This is my all-time favorite hangout/ coffee shop/ work-out-of-the-office place in Phoenix. The coffee is fantastic (and so is the green iced tea), and everyone is super friendly. But THE thing to go to FTC for are.... \n\nthe vegan brownies. \n\n\nI'm not a vegan; I love most meaty things. But if all vegan food could taste this good, I'd plaster Phoenix in PETA stickers.\n\nOnly downsides: chairs are uncomfortable, and there aren't enough outlets. But if you get their early enough, neither are issues at all.

<review>"""I can't add much to the great reviews, except I had to rave about Little Saigon!\n\nI've tried a few Vietnamese restaurants on the west side, then my hubby stumbled across Little Saigon on his first trip to Yelpland.  Located in charming downtown Glendale only two miles from home, we went there on a Saturday night.  There is a generous patio with lovely twinkle lights, and you can hear the music from the coffee shop across the street.  The interior is bright and cheerful, with, I think, 3 rooms.\n\nThe place was almost full - always a good sign, and a very friendly waiter seated us and took our drink orders.  The menu is generous, and the prices reasonable.  We shared spring rolls and potstickers.  Best spring roll ever, methinks: not too much lettuce as filler, delish pork and shrimp that tastes like it once swam, with a light peanut sauce that does not overwhelm.  The potstickers were also great - generously filled with tasty pork and veggies, complimented by a mild Asian BBQ sauce.  We were off to a good start.\n\nHubs, who is new to Vietnamese cuisine, and who gets props for trying, chose a pan fried rice noodle dish with meat (at least chicken and shrimp) and veggies.  He thoroughly enjoyed it, generously offering me one bite, and pretending not to notice when I stole a couple more.\n\n Just as my bench-mark dish for rating Thai restaurants is Pad Thai, my dish for Vietnamese food is Bun Thit Nuong (or Bun Thit Heo Nuong here).  My bowl had all the right stuff: tender, flavorful grilled pork (not a speck of gristle - a first in Phoenix!), lettuce, bean sprouts, cilantro, mint, and julienned cukes, vermicelli and sauce.  I love the sweet, vinegary sauce that comes with Bun Thit Nuong, and my sweet server told me the ingredients.  It was simply so very good.\n\nLittle Saigon has the whole package:  clean, cute, friendly and attentive service, and excellent food.  We can't wait to go back and try some of the other things on the menu, and mentioned in Yelp reviews.  Can you say \Yum, yum\"""", Dum Dum?"""""""

<review>"""Are my reviews disappearing? I submitted a photo of this place back in September and it's still there, but I would swear I wrote a review too....\n\nSo add me to the mozzarella sandwich love.  I could eat the hell out of that thing every day of the week. Really wish I still lived close by so I could. The sandwich is so perfect, and so FRESH tasting unlike so many other \caprese\"""" style sandwiches I have tasted. And for $8 you get a HUGE sandwich. Go get it, you wont be disappointed.\n\nThe piece of candy/chocolate they give you is a welcome touch :)"""""""

<review>Expensive. Small. Filled with talent.\n\nWalked in with a ten minute browsing mentality, on our way to the airport to head back home to CA, we stopped off to buy a cupcake next door...and spotted this ultra-cute spot. Absolutely NO intention to buy anything...but I can't pass up a boutique crawl.\n\nSo how did we rush out 15 min later with two pairs of butt-hugging William Rast jeans for him and two extremely sassy dresses for me?? \n\nThe fabulous female duo that runs this place! They got talent. Quickly dressing my hub in what looks good on him, and tossing me a pair of heels to go with the dress I was modeling in front of the 3way, they knew how to make the most of the short time we did have and make it work. \n\nDresses 50% off and jeans lookin' way too hot, my wallet lost the battle with my inner fashionista. I wish these ladies had a shop near me....they had ridiculously cute stuff and tons of it.\n\nWait, my bank account says maybe not. But anyway, Happy 5 Year Anniversary to us...we deserve a splurge!

<review>"""I walked in the front door.  The sign said, \Wookie Wednesday! Howl like a wookie for a dollar off your meal!\""""  The guy behind the register looked down at my black tee emblazoned with a bold cartoon logo of yesteryear and exlaimed, \""""What's up Thundercat.

So why would a fly guy who's not such a high guy be into a place with weed up in his face?\n\nSimple.  The staff are entertaining.  The food is good and not too expensive.  I enjoy watching pictures of presidents, aliens, and your mom (I swear, go check, third polaroid from the end!)  sharing a toke and a smile while my sandwich is being situated.\n\nCheba is always on my list when I'm looking for something to fulfill my late, but not too late night cravings.  Even so, I still prefer take away.  It's a fun place.. for about five minutes while my sandwich is getting made.  And then I'm ready to jet.\n\nI know I'm gonna jinx myself... but these guys have never fucked up my meal.  How cool is that?"""""""

<review>"""Coup Des Tartes is a solid 4 stars with the potential of being 5 stars with a few menu updates.  After reading some of the Yelper reviews I was a bit perplexed about what to expect when a friend invited me to join him at Coup Des Tartes.  After h told me this is a BYO, pas de probleme ~ you can count me in!! \n\nFirst off, there are not enough fine dinning BYO places in Phoenix!  PLEASE HELP ME SPREAD THIS THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY!!  It's a \good time\"""" when you're able to bring your favorite wines with you to dine and not pay the restaurant's prices.  Especially when it's at a place that offers quality food and service at reasonable prices.  \nSure there is a \""""cork fee\"""", but I look at it this way ~ I would rather pay $9 for the \""""cork fee\"""" and $30 for a bottle of Chateau La Galiane Cabernet Sauvignon I can buy at Total Wine, which would cost $100 (plus) at any other fining dinning restaurant.  \nTheir food and drink pricing is very reasonable considering the quality and taste. This is where I think CDT has an opportunity to improve.  They have a limited menu and since they are a French restaurant, they should think about offering some of the more updated French dishes.  A stereotypical French meal is heavy in saturated fats; heavy creams and butter which are staples in many French dishes and what CDT offers is no different.  Think about offering some of the newer French style dishes that include crepes, more game meats and sea food dishes.\n\nAppetizer~ their delicious three onion Tart and it was excellent! (sweet and savory and decadent).  We also had the Mate Horn and the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad which was very good. \n\nEntrees~ the Filet Mignon, cooked mid-rare of course with sides of mashed potatoes and haricots verts.  I had their signature dish: the Lamb Shank.  It was extremely meaty, \""""fall off the bone\"""" tender. The couscous was very fresh and it had just the right amount of veggies and sauce to pull everything together.  \n\nDesert~ Pumpkin Tarte and fresh cup of French caf\u00e9.  It was also very good.  \n\nService~ exceptional.  They were extremely attentive and very friendly, but not too friendly if you know what I mean...  They brought us a wine decanter and an aerator without asking.  The place is very quaint with somewhat of a homely feel and yet very simple in d\u00e9cor. \n\nWine~ FANTASTIQUE!  Will plan to bring a second bottle next time!"""""""

<review>Lodging - 4 Stars:\n\nI really enjoyed the historical background of the property and the rooms where each in their own one-story area (I was honestly expecting some high rise thing) and a small patio. Rooms were outfitted very nicely, they were fancy -- but not so outdone that you felt out of place. \n\nWent with a friend and the two sinks in the room were an excellent bonus. Each evening spent sitting outside, enjoying a bit of wine and the warm Arizona air. Beds were exquisite, rooms were quiet and just enough luxury to make you feel pampered without being overwhelmed by staff or extra charges for amenities.\n\nWe got a room close to the pool, and although a bit nippy in the evenings to go swimming -- it was a short shuffle away from the large hot tub which was excellent (except for the drunk couple that decided to turn it into their personal boudoir...)\n\nSpa - 3.5 Stars:\n\nI have mixed feelings about the spa. First issue was when I was trying to make my appointment and the front desk did not seem very knowledgeable about the services they offered (for skin types, etc.) Then, upon arriving we received a tour of the facilities which was not very personable and seemed so rehearsed. (Also, I think I can find the bathroom and the towels, and I also know how to open up a locker....the tour turned into 15 minutes of me not being able to be in the Jacuzzi.)\n\nIt seems that they schedule everyone at the same time for their services...because before I knew it the calm waiting room had turned into a packed holding cell for half the women of Scottsdale. One by one, they called the clients into their services...but it just felt a tad awkward. \n\nMy massage was EXCELLENT. The masseuse was extremely good, probably one of the best I've had and really enjoyed it. I'm not particularly shy, so it's easy for me to relax pretty quickly when getting a massage. Afterwards, had a facial and the Asthetician was also quite good -- my face was glowing for two days afterwards. I REALLY appreciated that she didn't try to sell me on the products she used, which after a relaxing facial -- the last thing I was is you trying to hawk your $50 face cream in a tube the size of lip gloss.

<review>I went to the new 'Nous' with my girlfriends a couple of weeks ago and we had a blast.  Of course there was the standard no card, and a $5 cover that Friday night, but it was well worth the ATM fee.  \n\nThis is the kind of place you can hear some blues, reggae, soul, and disco to boggie the night away.  I preferred to drink a mixed cocktail and do the twist for most of the night and had a fabulous time.  There is limited seating and it does get crowded (with good reason), so arrive early or plan on spending your night on the dance floor!  \nThe staff is straight forward and they get the job done well, music is top notch for Phoenix, the capital of non blues bar having cities..! have fun!
</review>
<review>I wish I had tried this place earlier! It has quickly become my go-to place for pizza in the Valley. I really like Oregano's, but they are better known for their specialty pizzas and when I crave sausage pizza they aren't my number one choice. I've never actually eaten in-shop as I always pick it up and take it home, but they are prompt and I've never had to wait for it to finish. There is seriously something addicting in their sweet sauce, because you definitely start to crave it after a while. I wasn't quite sure the first time I had it, but I've quickly come to love the taste.\n\nI tend to go between the Mama's Signature, the Combo, and the Sausage and Peppo, but I've never had a bad pizza. Way better than the chains! I've found it even reheats better than most.
</review>
<review>A coffee shop is good when...\n\n1. they serve delicious caffeinated beverages \n2. they offer tasty treats to soothe your hunger pains\n3. they provide sufficient room to get work done. \n\nRoyal at the Market offers all three. The coffee is creamy, and full of a caffeinated kick which is the perfect boost to the day. I like iced coffee and enjoy their iced latte here. They have plenty of pastries to munch on and more important, the Downtown Public Market is just a step through a pair of doors. Finally, they have plenty of seating where it's easy to get work done. They have community tables as well as individual high tops. They also have a back room with seating as well.  \n\nBetween the Market and Royal at the Market, this is an ideal spot to visit for a beverage and to do some work and I like to visit as often as I can.
</review>
<review>I love it! The diviest piece of crap hole in the wall, but they make the best food! The sweet and sour pork is actually chopped pork, with a heavy breading and cooked just right. So much better than the standard deep fried pork balls at other places. The egg rolls aren't actually wrapped, but they dip them batter and fry them without any wrapping. The soups are great, and the family dinners which come with soup, egg roll, and entree are a great value. The servers are pretty old chinese women that will not bend for anything... at all. We orderd a meal for two, and then asked to order a third one and she refused, saying they already started cooking it, and we would have to order another meal for two... odd. Also odd, is they have a birdcage with a fake cardinal in the center of the dining room. This is so far the best chinese I have found in Phoenix, a city that should be known for having no good chinese restaurants.

<review>I'm actually taking off 1 star for all the anti-Obama stickers they had by the register. Sadly I do realize we have to put up with the uneducated from time to time but that was a bit much. \n\nOk, on to the food. This was the first time I have been to Capt Bills and did not have any idea of what to expect. I did check out the reviews on Yelp and they looked pretty good. I have driving by this place for years  and never stopped in so I figured why not. \n   When I first walked in I liked the look of the place. Lots of wood and it felt like an old school joint. I walked up to order and was greeted by a rather attractive young lady and thats always a good way to start things. I ordered the 10 inch Italian and 2 10 inch pastrami subs. Price was not to bad overall. The Italian sub is dirt damn cheap for what you get. I did order to go so I picked it up and went on home to try out this new (to me) place. \n   I took a bite of the Italian first and was amazed at how good it was. Lots of flavor with a nice fresh taste. Excellent bread with good cheese. This is a winner in my book. I will be back for the Italian. \n    I then reached over and took a bite of the pastrami and again was shocked at how good it was. This is not the type of pastrami you find at places like Chompies but a bit more like lunch meat. It was however very good with no gristle at all. Great flavor and very good cheese. Another winner for me. I am now starting to think about trying more and more of what Capt Bills has to offer. \n    All in all Capt Bills gets high marks for the food but a big negative for the political B.S. on the walls. I will be back for the food but I will never start a chat about politics in this place.

<review>Overall great experience... Everyone seemed to keep an eye on their pooch but the amount of dogs humping each other was not to my taste.... I would come back... The park is very large, almost too large.... My dogs like to roam but the amount of people and dogs their was almost overwhelming.... They loved it but I was a bit worried someone might leave with my very trusting dogs.... And the 15 or so little dogs yapping and running back and forth was obnoxious.... But it was still a good evening....

<review>I was a dim sum virgin until yesterday!  My wonderful wife Audrey W was there to share my experience with me as were Dottsy Z, Donald S, Marian and Kevin H.  And Dottsy has pictures too!  And wow did I get off cheap!  \n\nThe best dim sum I have ever had!  Honestly, the only dim sum I have ever had!  I'm so glad I had other yelpers that were experienced to share it with and help me enjoy the first time!\n\nSeriously, Phoenix Palace has really good dim sum.  I enjoyed nearly everything I tried, there was tremendous variety and high quality through and through.  I was not quite as adventurous as some of the more experienced folks at the table.  I did pass on a dish that featured tripe.  Sorry.  Maybe I wasn't ready to go all the way.\n\nThe review trend has risen over the last few months.  I think I heard there was a change in ownership or management or possibly a new chef.  Or all of the above.  I don't know but it was good.\n\nFor 6 people and loads of food the total was just under $70.  Unreal.\n\nGreat lunch spot for dim sumderful variety and a total bargain.  Phoenix Palace is in the same parking lot as Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket so you can fill up on dim sum before you do your shopping.  Then you'll spend less when you go shopping.  Never go shopping hungry.

<review>"""I have been wanting to go to the Phoenix Art Museum for a long time now.  I just kept showing up on days they were closed or days when they didn't open until much later than I got there!  \n\nThey're closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and their hours are longer on Wednesdays.  Also, on Wednesdays, entry is free for everyone from 3P-9P; they just ask for a donation.  Kids under 6 are always free!\n\nLuckily, I was able to make it in today with my daughter.  \n\nThere is a current Paper exhibit that is pretty cool.  There is a papier mache sculpture exhibit by a Tucson artist that is veryyyyyy spooky.  There are dresses made from newspaper and the yellow pages.  There are lithographs of pop art you may recognize.  \n\nI liked that the museum houses a good balance of fine art and modern art.  I am not too keen on pop art, but DD is.  Her favorite piece in the whole museum was \The Artist who Swallowed the World,\"""" by Erwin Wurm.  She couldn't stop talking about it and remembered it by name.  She made sure to ask me what each piece was named, though sometimes she would dart to the next piece before hearing the answer.\n\nMy favorites were mostly in the fine art area.  I especially loved looking at all the old portraits.  Sometimes I felt as if they were alive.  If only the movie Night at The Museum was nonfiction!  But, seriously, the old masters really had a gift for painting their subject's gaze.  Fascinating!\n\nI also loved seeing the old bathing suits from the 20s and 50s and the old Naval uniforms.  I would LOVE to have a vintage bathing suit.  In fact, I might scour Etsy for one now!\n\nWe both loved the museum, even though I would have preferred to spend more time there.  DD was seeking quantity over quality today.  Perhaps I will get the chance to meander here another time with another adult!"""""""

<review>I cannot pass up the opportunity to take the FTR (First To Review) on Chef Aaron May's latest creation... \n\nI stopped by for a drink during their grand opening celebration last night.  While I arrived too late to sample the food, those around me said it was fabulous... \n\nThe place was packed but I think that is just because it was the grand opening... Located right on Main Street in Old Town, I can see this place being a perfect spot to grab a drink or a light bite after work, or as a more laid back place to go with a small group of people on a weekend night.  Aaron did a fabulous job with the decor.  I will return soon and update my review then... but I encourage anyone seeking a new hot spot in Old Town to go check out Mabel's On Main!

<review>Had a much better visit then 1 year prior.  My Order was ToGo.  The A la carte Taco's were generous on the meat and flavor.  Especialy the Tripa and Pastor.  The Carne asada was my least favorite.   The Chile Rellano was very nice.  The  Bakery Items that I enjoyed were the Bread Pudding, not the american style but a buttery Bar/Cake style and the sweet Potatoe filled Empanada which was a sweat soft  bread filled with autumn flavored sweet potatoes.  I will return for the Tripas Taco, Chille Rellano and the Bread pudding without a doubt.   The prices are very reasonable and there is plenty of parking in this Market style Order and wait business.  Do not go if you looking for a Nueva taco bistro or fancy setting.

<review>I love this place so much I would love to move to the area and volunteer. I came here to get my therapy pet which happens to be a guinea pig named Clark and while we were there we could not resist a rat named ratatouille so we snatched her up as well. I could not help but take forever looking at all of the darling pets and feel so sad that I could not take all of them home with me. The employees are very much as in love with pets as I am and you can tell that each and every one of them is an avid animal lover and not just some person who is working there because it's a job to them. \n\nThe person who helped us let us take our time petting each pig and getting a feel for each animal. He even played with the rat for what seemed like an extended amount of time. Don't expect to waltz in here and waltz on out of here in 15 minutes, you really want to make sure you feel a connection to the animal so just sit there and play and hold the animal. The employees will tell you all you need to know about the animal's history and demeanor. Plus they want to make sure that they are going to suitable homes so you will need to fill out an application and if you live in apartments make sure you go and adopt while your apartment complex office is open because they will need to call and make sure that you are allowed to have pets in your complex, no exceptions.\n\nThe staff is so friendly and we were even able to purchase an extra cage for $12! If you know small animal cages you recognize that this is a steal for a new, moderate sized animal cage. The facilities are very nice for an adoption center, there is a gift shop for your new pet so you can pick up beautiful collars and pet dishes ect. I think you even get a discount when you adopt a pet. Each animal has their own section and there are rooms where they will put in in with the pet and play with them. As I was leaving I couldn't help myself and took Clark out at the car so I could cuddle him, an employee was going home and stopped and chatted with me and was very nice as she was happy to see Clark going home. I also like that they provide you with a free vet exam and expenses paid (if needed) up to $500 for any conditions the pet might have although they are thoroughly taken care of at the shelter. The appointment just needs to be made within 5 days at any VCA hospital that they will give you a flyer for in your adoption packet. I will be back here again.

<review>I went here last night with the BF to use a Groupon I had bought. I really had wanted to go to Sens back in the day, but once we moved right across the street from it, they went out of business...sad times. Anyway, this was the first time we made it out to Sochu house. The place reminds me of a club turned restaurant...the decor is very dance club. We sat in the dining room, but the bar looked a bit cooler. At the suggestion of our (awesome) server, we had mostly tapas. We started with the potstickers, which we both thought were just ok. Then we got the orange puffs...very good. Lightly fried chicken with a sweet and spicy orange sauce over some tasty cabbage slaw. We then had the soup dumplings....Oh. Em. Gee. These were awesome! I haven't found dumplings like this anywhere else in Phoenix. They are salty and savory and delicious. So good, we ordered a second plate. We finished up with the red curry. This is supposedly the spiciest thing on the menu, but I didn't find it that spicy. It really was kind of a just okay curry. Could have been a tad bit thicker and had a little more flavor. I would definitely come back, however, for those delicious soup dumplings....I have actually been thinking about them all day. Also, they have some great specials like any 4 tapas for 20$ on Tuesdays and date night specials on Thursdays....Definitely will be back.

<review>A tale of 2 Phoenix AZ stories:\n\nPrior to Dec. 2010:\n\n'hey heather, have you ever been to phoenix before?'\n\nyeah i have long ago...all i remember was being in a motel with my dad scared to death while he watched pet cemetery. i was under the covers with my ears plugged and yet he continued watching it (wth dad?). i was probably 7 or 8.\n\n'but what else did you do?'\n\nno clue..thats the only memory ive retained O_o\n\n(this has been my answer for years)\n\n---\n\nAfter Dec. 2010:\n\n'hey heather, have you ever been to phoenix before?'\n\nyep! had a lovely time being shown around by my awesome guy...he took me up to the Compass Room where I got a panoramic view of the entire city during a full yellow moon.  It was really special :) And though more gushy a story than (previously) comical...I'm happy I now have this answer to share\n\n---\n\nAs a visitor to Phoenix, places like the Compass Room really shine to me. Beautiful, classy, iconic...this is a place to go for special occasions. Where *every* table is a good table to have a fantastic view of the entire city skyline while you slowly rotate around with good company. There are little plaques telling you what you are viewing throughout the time, which is neat.\n\nWe came around 9pm on week night during the holidays so it was fairly quiet and slightly atypical in social atmosphere, I imagine. Just for a glass of wine and a shared dessert - Bread Pudding (delicious). We were well taken care of by our professional and friendly server and had a lovely time.

<review>"""This place has a big sign outside that says \n\Under New Management\""""\n\nI'm not sure how new the management is, or if the old management sucked... whatever.  Don't really care.\n\nI totally dig this place.  $3.99/lb of live Fiji rock, AWESOME!\n$7.99/lb of live Tonga rock, HUZZAH!\n(I got 20lbs of live rock, and when I brought it home and set it up, all these little starfish and shrimp climbed out of the rock! )\n\nI'm new to the marine aquarium world and I like that the guys here totally love saltwater tanks, talking about them, giving advice, etc etc.\n\nThey've been very helpful, and have super cool fishies to stare at too!\nI like a lot."""""""

<review>Decided to pop in and get takeout for lunch today and holy cow, I'm blown away. Now I will say that the actual restaurant seemed cold and unfinished, but the food was killer! They were out of a few of the sides, but at the end of the day my meal was spectacular!!!! I went with the brisket sandwich with a side of seasonal vegetables. Now these weren't any regular vegetables, they actually cooked them in the smoker!! It was zucchini, mushrooms and peppers. Super great, perfectly cooked! My brisket sandwich was one of, if not, the best BBQ sandwich I've ever had period! The bark on the brisket was spectacular, nice spicy dry rub on the meat. The brisket itself was super tender and had that killer beef flavor you expect from a slow cooked brisket. The bbq sauce was a bit strange, but was pretty good. The sandwich didn't need it at all, super killer sandwich. Overall there were some minor things I'd change but hey, they're a new restaurant!!! Killer BBQ spot on Central Phoenix. Way to go guys!!! (now go put up some decorations will ya?)
</review>
<review>Yes, I know, this is my 2nd update so I'll try to make it short  and  sweet. \n\nI bought a Groupon about a week ago  and  decided to use it this past Saturday when the hubs  and  I were trying to think of a place to have lunch. I got the chili cheese dog this time  and  it was delicious! Cheese burger  and  onion rings were freakin yum as usual  and  I have to say the fries were better this time around. We went a lil crazy  and  got 4 additional sodas, along with the 2 we had during lunch, 2 root beers, 2 cream sodas  and  2 orange sodas. I also have to add, since this was our 1st time dining in, how clean it was! They had a girl at the register this time  and  she was super sweet.\n\nWe love this place!!
</review>
<review>Iowa Cafe is one of those places I always saw and wished to stop but never did. Someone from our church had told us that it had reopened under new management and in a different location. Then, we heard other friends talk about it and said that it was good with a down-home feeling. Well, one Sunday after church my whole family decided to go there for lunch. We all liked it!!\n\nMy husband ordered the meat loaf and he said that it remainded him of back home (Ohio) so I guess that's good. The food option in the kids menu is good and super affordable. I ordered a small traditional breakfast with bacon and country potatoes that was good but also ordered  a cinnamon roll to share with everybody that it was amazing!! Just make sure you ask for it to nice and warm. \n\nOverall, our first experience there has been nice. Service is great and super friendly!! We're definitely going back!!
</review>
<review>I love this place. I have had at least 8 screws in my tires over the past 6 months and they have patched them all for me for free! I did have one instance where my tire was beyond repair and not only did they offer me a credit for the old tire, they match a competitors price for a new tire that was similar and I ended up with a new tire for only 20 dollars! \nThey are fast, understanding of my time, and reliable. I will never go anywhere else because of how great they have always been!

<review>"""Fattoush (pronounced \Fuh-too-shh\"""") is essentially one of those hole in the wall, ethnic mom-and-pop dives people always yearn for when craving something a little more authentic. After several consistent recommendations from friends, well, I finally gave in to pressure.\n\nFirst off, it is not in a \""""sketchy location,\"""" really. No more \""""sketchy\"""" than many pockets throughout central Phoenix. So it's not Chandler or Surprise? Get over it. I rather relish any hints of urban grit. It's called living in a real city.\n\nThe interior is unremarkable, there is no atmosphere, however, it's clean. After seating yourself, someone brings you a menu. After eating at Fattoush on just a few repeat occasions, you will quickly become familiar with everyone who works there, and who knows, ended up addressing many of them on a first-name basis.\n\nMinus the few noticeable, more Mediterranean and pedestrian items (read: the Greek salad), Fattoush, for the most part, serves noticeably authentic food. In fact, it's probably one of the most genuine Middle-Eastern establishments you'll find in Phoenix. From their baba ghanoush and falafel to their tabouli and lamb kebabs, the food tastes fresh, and frankly, like it should.\n\nNothing on the menu is priced unreasonably. In fact, it's fairly cheap. Serving such good food, I'd be willing to pay a lot more. The service is never overbearing. If you go expecting someone to be circling your table every few minutes, asking if everything is alright, if you wanted another drink, etc., you will be disappointed. This is not Pita Jungle or the Cheesecake Factory, and, thank god for that.\n\nI probably eat there now two or three times a month, and it's consistency comforting. If you truly love Middle Eastern food beyond hummus and lentil soup, you will truly love Fattoush. It would be worth a visit. \n\nI am truly glad I discovered it."""""""

<review>I was on a savage hunt for some yogurt and was determined to find the perfect spot to satisfy my craving... you know when you're craving something in particular and even though you really want it you become super picky?? yeah that was me.. we must have drove by 5 yogurt spots and i was being a brat and could not make up my mind which place i wanted to go into. When we drove past this place i was intrigued by the design  and decorations. It has a old 50 classic diner feel to it which i thought was cute. Even all  the employees were in their dorky little outfits/hats.\n\nwhat is frozen custard you ask??? It is better than ice cream... it is freakin delicious! toppings are endless.. Everything from sprinkles to cap'n crunch! I got the lemon flavored custard mixed with coconut, graham crackers and butter toffee nuts.. shit was the BOMB! so effin'' good.. better than i could have though.. \n\nYou can get large pint sizes to take home... they also serve hamburgers, sandwiches, strawberry shortcakes, root bear floats, French fries ..you get the idea.\n\nJust did dessert this time.. but i will be back Nielsen's..oh yes i will be back.
</review>
<review>What can I say?  This is my favorite place in the world to eat or drink.  I don't know where to begin.\n\nAt both locations whether it's busy as all hell or dead, we are always seated pretty promptly.  \n\nThe beer is top notch.  Kiltlifter is my #1 favorite beer of all time.  I've tried them all and they are all very competitive but Kiltlifter takes the cake.\n\nOnto the foodies.  Without a doubt, any burger on the menu is going to be monstrous and delightful.  Mushroom and Swiss is my backup but I've recently fallen in love with the Jalapeno burger.  It's cream cheese, roasted jalapenos (not spicy) and onion straws.  For $9 you can't beat it.  I really haven't strayed away from my favorites (I tend to stick with what I love) but anything anyone has ordered on the menu, there has never been a complaint.\n\nWithout a doubt, if you are just visiting for a day or two in Tempe or Scottsdale, this is the place you want to go for lunch or dinner.  It will save you on the pocketbook and you'll leave with a smile on your face.\n\nThey also play wonderful music and have lots and lots of television.  I have also never had to wait longer than 5 minutes to sit at a table.
</review>
<review>My friend and I went here after a day of spring training baseball and we were indecisive on where to eat.  This was close to where we were staying and looked nice with good reviews.  Wow, I really enjoyed this place!  The service was friendly, and quite a good menu.  I decided on a pizza with meatballs on it and my friend got the pasta puglia and we shared.  The pasta puglia was AMAZING!!!  So fresh and tasty; but we got it on spagettini instead of the fusilli.  I really enjoyed the pizza too!  Good crust, not too think and the meatballs were not dried out from the oven; the garlic was a great touch!  The bread you get to start is also quite good!\n\nI would definately return!
</review>
<review>Okay, the drive through is never really quick but the food is always hot nonetheless - which is why I guess the drive through is not quick!   I am willing to wait - the other day I was really hungry and on the road - grabbed 3 rolled tacos with guacamole - soooo YUM!  We go to  Taco Tuesday often and the carne asada taco, while not 99cents, is a worthy add-on - Cucumber Slices are a great snack while you are waiting for your number to be called.
</review>
<review>When I lived in Phoenix, I used to frequent CB quite often as the food was reasonably priced, breakfast or lunch was always good and service was stellar. I also liked the store in front of the restaurant and would often find things to buy from seasonal items to collectibles (long ago it was Boyd's Bears) and they had good candy.\n\nWell, I have lived in the Bay Area for well over 8 years again and this was the first time I have been back to a Cracker Barrel. This time was for breakfast with my Mom and daughter. The service, as I remembered was fantastic, the menu huge but with things from reasonably sized to giant portions and all that in between. This was the first restaurant I can remember that asked me if I wanted my poached eggs soft, medium or hard (soft please) and the cheesy hashbrown casserole was still as good as I remembered. \n\nI will be back when I come back to town next and I can't wait!
</review>
<review>I think I'm going to be biased when writing this, because the nostalgia and the atmosphere are what really keep me coming back again and again, despite the average food.\n\nI try to go here at least once a month on First Friday, since I park at Burton Barr. I remember going here with my dad when I was in 5th grade, and always wanting to sit in the train inside the restaurant, hah. But like i said above, the atmosphere is what they really exceed with, and atmosphere is one of the most important aspects of a restaurant, in my opinion. It's sporadically placed knick-knacks and odd furniture selection are all part of it's charm. \n\nThe food here is alright, and decently priced. Waiters are always friendly and you never have to wait more than 15 minutes for a table, even with large parties, because the place is so enormous. \n\nThe Old Spaghetti Factory is nothing novel or award-winning, but it's homey feeling is what attracts me more than anything else.
</review>
<review>Best omelet ever.  The O'Pear Grenache omelet was incredible, I tasted my companions and was immediately regretting my choice of French Toast.  The French Toast was really good, but didn't compare to that omelet.\n\nThe service was incredible.  The place was absolutely packed, but my table of two never lacked for attention.  What we did lack was space!  The table we were at was TINY, our meals and drinks barely fit on the table. The restaurant itself is not large, it is actually quite cramped.  Don't go here if you are bothered by crowds and cramped quarters.  It's also quite loud on weekends, conversation was difficult.\n\nWe went on a Saturday around 10am.  We managed to get a table immediately, but it looked like most others had about a 15 minute wait.
</review>
<review>"""so i've heard this place is \as good\"""" as bianco's....i wouldn't know because on principle alone, i absolutely, definitively REFUSE to stoke the ego and elitism of anyone req'ing me to wait 2 hours to eat their food. \n\nthe place is cute and has plenty of room to avoid a 2 hour wait....and the pizza was good. wood oven baked so it had that little burnt crispy edge. we had the mahhhhgahhhhrita pizza and it was enough to stave our pizza crave. and then we indulged in their version of the desert pizza cookie. although quite bigger than oregano's, it wasn't as sweet, but altogether still tasty! \n\nfor our pizza, half the desert, a glass of wine....20 bucks for 2 people!"""""""

<review>"""Venti is Large. Grande is Medium. Tall is Small? Confused? You don't need a conversion chart to order a beverage at Unlimited Coffee. \n\nI am greeted upon entering with a friendly hello. After issuing my personal litmus test for any new coffee place I try out: the Americano, I am asked for my punch card. \Punch... card?\"""" I ask quizzically. I explain that this is my first visit to their fine establishment. Buy 10 and get 1 free.  At first I was hesitant to try a coffee place not adorned by a topless half-fish/half-woman person but now, I see that they have something that that other place doesn't offer. Customer loyalty apparently has a reward in this universe! I order the largest Americano they serve (a \""""large\"""" they call it) and eventually it cools to less than 200 degrees, allowing me to finally enjoy it without risk of 3rd degree face burns. The coffee is flavorful and rich and I finish it quickly. Other items on the menu include your standard lattes and mochas, but another item not on that other place's menu: gelato. I decide to reserve that treat for a future visit. \n\nThe atmosphere is not unlike that of your friendly neighborhood Pizza Hut. I don't mean this negatively. I mean... who doesn't love place mats you can color?? Yet, there seems to be the lingering vibe that this building used to be a part of said pizza conglomerate. There is a large, rectangular table in the middle of the shop surrounded by tables and the occasional love seat. The only thing I find fault with is their choice of chairs around some of the tables. They are plastic and not unlike something you'd find in Cousin Eddie's backyard. If you can secure an upholstered seat, then this becomes a non-issue. \n\nFor those of you with portable computer machines (a \""""laptop\"""" is what they call it) you can surf the 'net with ease. Power supplies dangle from the ceiling precariously (a la Tom Cruise in the first \""""Mission: Impossible\"""" film) allowing you to pretty much jack in to the matrix from any seat without fear of your \""""laptop\"""" dying.\n\nWith a very friendly staff, wifi and outdoor furniture on the inside, Unlimited Coffee is definitely a welcome change from that other coffee monster. Oh, and I can't forget to try the gelato next time."""""""
</review>
<review>Scratch Pastries is one of the best place to get sandwiches. I love their Smoked Duck Breast w/ Walnut, moist and tender with the crunchiness from walnuts.  While salads in general are not high on my list, I really like their salad that comes with the sandwiches.  The dressing is really good and perfect for the salad.  Don't forget to try the Chicken Breast w/ Dijon Mustard Mayo  and  Italian Ham w/ Aged Comte Cheese sandwiches too.  \n\nI forsee myself coming back to this place everytime I have a hankering for a good sandwich.
</review>
<review>Peeps, let's get real for a second:  when I go thrifting, I absolutely hate how dirty some places can be.  This place is like a beautiful, sparkling gem. I mean, reallllllly clean!  Off to a great start, if I do say.\n\nThe ladies working that day were all very nice and helpful, as I had several questions and needed to use the toilet.  Clothing is nicely arranged, and all items and pretty easily accessible.  The day that I shopped there, all blue tag items were a whopping dollar!  Score.\n\nWhile I didn't find anything on my first trip, I am happy to say I will be heading there soon to try and find a glorious Christmas/Hanukka/Kwanzaa/other this-time-of-year-holiday sweater.  \n\nSee you soon, Flo!

<review>Blue Nile has great raw food.  This is important,, because there aren't too many places available to get raw food now.  Although it is bit pricey, having raw food available is important, due to the role the enzyme plays in the human body.  Raw food will cure cancer and make all other degenerative diseases go away.  It is true.  Read about it.....\n\nSince Rawsome Cafe of Tempe, which used to be in the old Coop on University, just west of Mill, I have had to go to Pomegranite which is all the way in Ahwatukee.  \n\nThank you Blue Nile.  Your Ethiopian food is good too, but I'd love to see that raw food menu expand.....
</review>
<review>The customer service is great! they have a gym and pool that opens at 6am and closes at 11pm. They provide a complimentary continental breakfast for guests and also have a full service kitchen. they have a living area with a huge flat screen to watch games and a full bar across the way. oh, and cant forget the internet cafe area. They also have a bell hop to handle your luggage in and out of your car. \n\nthe rooms are queen size beds and have patios. i love it! \n\nalso, great tip AAA discount 15%..
</review>
<review>Sushi Brokers is a great place for happy hour.  Myself and my friends always find ourselves here.  They have TV's in every direction to watch whatever game is on and great contemporary music keeping the place exciting.  You definitely want to make sure you get here as early as possible, because the seats fill up quickly.\n\nThe nice thing about their happy hour menu is just about every roll is on it.  You get a solid selection to choose from ranging from $4 to like $16.  \n\nThe Lollipop Roll  is by far my favorite.  Its assorted fresh fish, shrimp, avocado, and spicy krab mix rolled in cucumber and topped with masago, siracha and ponzu! MMMM  It's fun because each piece actually comes on a stick so you can eat it like a lollipop.  It's a great summer roll, both refreshing and spicy at the same time.
</review>
<review>i think that locally-sourced, organic food done simply speaks for itself. add a charming host, an open kitchen and a welcoming atmosphere and you have a winning combination!   \n\nmy experience with FnB began with the message i received to confirm my dinner reservation.  pavle, the owner and our host for the evening, made me feel as if i'd called my uncle to say i was coming to dinner and he couldn't be more delighted!  when we arrived at the restaurant, our warm greeting from both him and his wife emily, continued the personal touch that set the tone for our experience at FnB.\n\ni am by no means a wine conniseur, but my dining partner was quick to point out that - although all the wines are locally sourced - they were all blended.  pavle let us know that they are introducing a varietal to the selection this week.\n\nmy favorites were the slivered fennel and the grilled lamb tenderloin.  however, i'm sure i could try anything on the menu without being dissappointed.  unfortunately, i was too full for dessert, but that will give me an excuse to go back!
</review>
<review>Dining at Roaring Fork was enjoyable. The decor is warm and cozy, with an upscale vibe. Our large group was accommodated for on the patio, and since it was happy hour, we were quite a demanding bunch.  The service was a little slow, but all drinks and food came out perfectly. \n\nI had trouble deciding what to order because everything looked so good! I split the Big Ass Burger (a huge ground chuck patty with cheddar cheese, peppered bacon, thick-cut tomatoes, pickles, and onions) and a kettle of fries with a couple friends. I also had the mixed greens salad (field greens with candied walnuts and feta, with some sort of vinegarette). The ahi tuna looked really good, as did the fish tacos. I also heard raves about the green pork chili. \n\nSo many amazing options  and  a great atmosphere--I'll definitely be back soon!!
</review>
<review>The food, service and ambience were great.  The only bad part about it was the noise.  It was loud on a Saturday night.  The menu has many great choices.  I'd like to return to try some other things.  The bruschetta options were terrific, including fig, prosciutto, and caprese.  I had the Saturday night special which was the chicken pot pie.  It was a terrific meal with great vegetables, crust and meat.  Sean, our server, was really a great host.  The music was fun, but a little on the loud side.
</review>
<review>I get into these wild food moods where Ill wake up and have a craving for something, its usually pretty specific, this particular morning it was corned beef. Sounds crazy but once I get it in my head I wont be satisfied until I give into my cravings. I wasn't hungry though for just any corned beef, it had to be Boar's Head brand, aside from a few grocery stores the only place you can get Boar's Head is a good delicatessen. I knew just where to go, Scott's!\n\nSituated between an Ace Hardware and a Basha's, this seems hardly the spot for a tasty sandwich. Let me tell you, they serve up massive tasty sandwiches with thick piled meat on your choice of bread and they have choices. Feeling helpless and at complete mercy to my urges I ordered Scott's Perfect Reuben-Reuben ($11.50). So tall you cant get your mouth around it, its stuffed with corned beef, swiss cheese and sauerkraut then grilled to a crispy buttery goodness.\n\nWhen the server set my sandwich in front of me my eyes widened, it was a thing of beauty and desire. As I managed my sandwich for the first bite, I felt the wafts of hot corned beef beckoning, eat me, eat me. Enjoying bite after satisfying bite, my morning craving was quickly becoming fulfilled like an ancient prophecy. Ordering a side of Russian dressing to dunk my fries into may sound slightly odd but after one dip I think you'll agree, its perfectly natural.\n\nFor the health conscious who are rolling their eyes at my delicious choices, Scott's does offer lighter fare such as salads, soup and half sandwiches. However, I for one don't go to Scott's to eat light, I go to Scott's eat well.

<review>Liquor? Good!\n\nIce cream? Better!\n\nLiquor and ice cream TOGETHER? THE BEST!\n\nMy hubby, cousin and I were in the middle of our road trip and were on our way out of Scottsdale to get to New Mexico. But when I saw this place pop up on my Yelp app, we made a U-turn from getting onto the freeway.\n\nThis store is located in a really nice and cute part of town. I could totally spend my afternoons walking around.\n\nI tried pretty much all the flavors there. Vodka Orange Cream was one of my favorites. It totally tastes like an orange creamsicle with a kick of vodka. My absolute favorite was Long Island Butterscotch. It was super strong like a real Long Island. It was just enough to get the flavor. And it was accompanied by little nuggets of butterscotch goodness. \n\nThere are only about 15 - 20 alcoholic and non-alcoholic flavors out at a time, but the owner (who is a friendly lady) has tons of flavors that cycle. You can see the complete list of flavors on their website. \n\nBy the way, make sure you have your ID! Or else you'll be stuck with the kiddie flavors. The non-alcoholic flavors are good, but just not as fun. =) This place is a perfect finish to a night out with your friends!

<review>I've been coming to Fair Trade Cafe ever since my move back to Phoenix in 2010 when I was living on Portland.  I met a friend here for coffee, at his suggestion, and have been coming here ever since.\n\nFor awhile, I spent three nights a week here either meeting about my book or writing it.  It was such a relaxed atmosphere and the employees were the nicest coffee shop employees in town.  \n\nSince moving to Ahwatukee, I have not had much occasion to visit the cafe.  Recently, I have been downtown more frequently.  I've popped in three times in the last week just to read.  \n\nThey now have the rewards terminal for Belly next to their register, which I've seen popping up at small businesses in town.  They have bigger tables.  They have gotten rid of their retail offerings (apparently they were collecting too much dust).  Their pastry case has been removed.  \n\nBut other than those basic changes, Fair Trade Cafe is essentially the same.  It is a great local cafe where you can get basic eats (today I had an egg and cheese croissant) and good drinks at a fair price.  And you can feel good doing it, too.  They support fair trade practices.  \n\nI've tried a few other local coffee shops in town and they're just not for me.  The vibe here at Fair Trade is relaxed.  I feel comfortable sipping on my soy hot cocoa or Italian soda at my own pace as I read a book.  I don't feel rushed.  I feel only the utmost relaxation.  \n\nIf you're working on a project, having a quick meeting, writing a paper (or a book) or just want a place to pop in to get away from the hustle and bustle for awhile, Fair Trade Cafe should be your place.\n\nThis place reminds me so much of SF Bay Area cafes.  It's just like home!\n\nA side note: One of the owners, Stephanie, is one of the nicest people in Phoenix.  She is such a genuine person and I really wish her every success in growing her business.

<review>"""OK, I'm adding a star to PastaBar because the food deserves it.  That and the \Jack on Mulberry Street\"""" cocktail - very tasty.  So, I've figured out what didn't strike me initially about PB.  It's not so much the art as the whole decor.  It's not bad.  It''s just not as put together as I'd hoped for a downtown local.  It's fine really, just not my style.  The food on the other hand is sublime; inventive and flavorful.  The portions are absolutely fair as is the price.  Now if I can just get them to lower the price of that great cocktail!"""""""

<review>As promised in my initial review for Primp and Blow, I returned... and this time took advantage of more services too!\n\nSince today is my birthday, I wanted to pamper myself just a bit.  I spent my lunch hour at P and B getting a brow/lip wax from Kai and a blowout from Liz.  Wow - what a difference that makes - I feel so much better now!  Both ladies did an excellent job and were a pleasure to chat with during my pampering.\n\nIn addition, there's currently a check-in offer on Yelp where you just have to share your Yelp check-in and you get a free Rain Cosmetics gift valued at $30.  It's a limited edition collection that includes an eye pencil, lip gloss, bronzer, mascara, and make-up remover wipe.  I'm not normally so excited about freebies, but this is a great one!\n\nI ended up purchasing a hair product as well (it's my birthday - why not?!) -- excited to use it at home!\n\nSo, I'm two for two with my visits here... adult pigtails? check! wash and blow out? check! wax? check! great products and service? check!  I'm indeed a fan!
</review>
<review>Good selection of beer.  Not as seasonal as I would have expected, but fun nonetheless.  (Also, they need to get some sours!)  Great way to taste some brews before you stop by the specialty shop and spend $10-20 on a bottle.  Food is very very good - but make no mistake, this is an alehouse, not a restaurant, so the menu is small.  Also, the menu is for foodsies, so if you're more of a burger and fries kind of person, eat before you come.  If you love creative dishes with ingredients like prosciutto or chorizo, you'll like eating here.  Will be back many times, I'm sure.
</review>
<review>"""First of all, if you are going to have dim sum, go early during the weekend because that is when the quality and freshness are best. Also go in a large group so that the bill is less for everyone. I have been here a few times on Sunday mornings around 10 am and never have to worry about waiting for a table. They have a decent selection of dim sum dished. My usual's are the \footballs\"""", the Hau gau, and the taro cakes, all of which are decent. If you wait long enough, you might be able to get your hands on the coconut pastries called \""""snow balls\"""" which are very enjoyable. In a hungry group of 4, you can expect to pay $20-25 total as a group and not want to eat anything for the next 6-12 hours."""""""
</review>
<review>I love this place.  I have visited it a couple of times and last time was for restaurant week.  Everything is great. I love the sauteed prawns with pineapple salsa and for the sides my favorites are the jalapeno creamed corn (can't get enough) and the cheddar mashed potatoes. On a previous visit I had the Pernil Asado, really awesome.  For dessert I like the Horchata bread pudding.  The place is very cozy, just a few tables inside.  I am so happy we have nice weather now, so we can sit in the patio.  Can't wait to go back.

<review>STAY HERE! - Truly a hidden gem!\n\nIn an age where service is gone, personality has been lost, and most everything is either overpriced, disappointing, or corporate and cold, FIRESKY is unlike anyplace else. Is it absolutely perfect? No, but it is almost perfect. Do they strive for perfection in a very sincere and personal way?- yes!\n\nThis is truly one of the best stays you could imagine - in Scottsdale or otherwise. The staff is friendly, and anything that might go wrong is addressed immediately. The management is seriously killer. They are in it to win it, and clearly they are establishing a reputation as truly personal, service oriented, while creating an intangible positivity and sense of well-being having to do with the actual human interaction that radiates through the place. You won't want to leave. Can you actually be homesick for a hotel? Yep. \n\nSpecifics- the afternoon gratis wine is a nice touch, and encourages guests to convene late in the afternoon.. Met some nice folks while getting our glasses filled. The pool areas are fantastic.. The small sand 'beach' is addictive- it's like playing in a Zen rock garden in the water. We had some local friends stop by for cocktails in the lobby bar- they brought their kids so the Wii in the lobby was heaven sent. The loungers and cabanas are appointed very well, with fantastic pillows and such. I could go on and on. But you will love the people of Firesky as much as the place itself. If you are a stuffed shirt, who demands a cookie cutter, corporate polish, stay elsewhere. If you want to feel good, really good, stay here. Special thanks to Gail and Cheryl for their professionalism and warmth.

<review>"""I admit Im not really a fan of the college bar scene in Tempe.. but enroute to the ASU/USC game last weekend.. my boyfriend said we should get our brew suds on before hitting the stadium.. little did I realize that I like beer (just one icy one!) while watching the Sundevils take on my home states school... (maybe thats to ward off the smack talkers of those from AZ around me! \University of Spoiled Children\"""".. 'they are all spoiled beach yuppies!'... WHAT????) but my own Sundevil says there isnt a beer to be had inside the stadium.. This place was actually alot of fun... packed to the walls with , none other than big old loud frat boys.. and cute sorority girls.. The servers still remained friendly and swift.. amongst the crowd.. Daves Electric Beer was icy and hit the spot.. game on!"""""""

<review>"""One can say an \ariline\"""" is \""""an airline\""""...this may be true however Southwest gets my attention everytime\n\nAnd here's why\n\n1) they are people movers. They have attendants walking the checkin areas to make sure you are on time and if not, they will move you up the line so you don't miss your flight. Now then, moving you up the ladder and not intefering with other passengers? Unbelieveable. They have a separate counter to deal with the late ones.\n\n2) 2 bags checked in free. What ariline does that these days\n\n3) At the gate, your boarding pass is coded to board by zones. Prevents the unorderly stampede of folks trying to get a good seat on the plane\n\n4) In flight? Attendants with humor. I've always had chuckles listening to the attendants as they annouce the comings and goings\n\nThese are just a few of their good points; solid though. Now if they upgrade their fleet, I might give them an extra star!"""""""

<review>Ok, so first for the bad: \nSo the first time I went there was when some friends invited me.\nThey were already at the restaurant, I was still in bed at home in Avondale. I showered, dressed and drove over there...they were still waiting for a table. In fact once I got there we waited another 30 minutes for a table. that means my friends were waiting over an hour and a half for a table.\nMy other complaint is that my potatoes are always too burnt, even when I tell them not to burn them.\nThey are closed on Monday (you would have thought I would remember this the first two Monday;s I came to eat here)\nSo now for the good:\nEverything else! I love the food!\nThe Chop  and  Chick and griddle cakes are my fave for breakfast and for lunch I love...well just about everything!\nCan't wait till I move back so I can go again!!

<review>I have been a fan of Joes BBQ for a long time now.. so when I heard about this place my expectations and excitement was huge!'\n\nSure enough the drive over from north west mesa was worth it. Everything from the parking on the unique looking pavers from the tall trees said this place was special!\n\nThe friendly young lady at the counter tossed out a suggestion for the Buffalo chicken sandwich and I went for it. Now here is the kicker.. I firmly dislike anything that has to do with blue cheese.. So when i received my amazing looking platter and inside the burger there it was I almost took it back.\n\nI tried it anyways rather than order something else or scrape it off.. and WOW. My taste buds loved it! My girlfriend knows I talk a lot.. well I was all but quiet for once as I finished every bite lol\n\n\nWhile out side the place has a very warm, back home, family feeling, just a very positive experience! I was told this place was amazing, looks like Ill be saying the same thing to others!\n\nOne thing I was hoping for on the wonderful drink station was the red cream soda you have at the BBQ rest.. but the tea was well enough to put away my dismay.\n\nHome run for the joe's crew, this place brings it all together :)

<review>Sat at the bar and had absolutely wonderful service. Boy does that make such a difference. Friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive. \n\n We did happy hour. I had a flight of their house beers. Really liked their Hefeweizen; crisp and tasty. \n\nWe had the wings buffalo style M with blue cheese sub for ranch. My wife didn't like them saying they were soggy. I thought they were ok but rather scrawny. They need larger ramekins to dip in too. \n\nI had the 5 meat deep dish and I was astonished how good it was. Really thick with the meat. \n\nAgain bartenders Edith and Corey were outstanding. If we lived near by I would come back just for their service.
</review>
<review>Heres the deal...this place really isn't that bad...definitely not worthy of one star.\n\nOur room..or condo sized apartment type thing was enormous and very clean.  There were no hairs on the bed or showers like others had seen. The kitchen was loaded with utensils/pots/pans..very awesome. The walls were pretty thin though..and we were able to hear a crying baby at ungodly hours of the morning. So that was a bummer but that only happened once in our 5 day stay.\n\nThe kids pool was actually the biggest pool I have ever seen in my life..It was also very clean and never had more than 5 people hanging out at one time. The adult pool area was much smaller and felt more like a bar area with a hot tub..also cool but we were looking for a good swim. \n\nThe tennis court was a plus.\n\nThe staff was very helpful and friendly...no attitudes or snootyness. \n\nThey do offer free wireless in the lobby.  It worked great.  If you want internet in your room..its $5 for 24 hours.  We didn't even bother with that though. \n\nThis is definitely the kind of resort where you are cooking your own meals  and cleaning your own sheets. There is no restaurant or lounge...but there are tons of restaurants and stores nearby. \n\nWe were very relaxed here and felt well taken care of. Its really not as bad as others made it out to be.

<review>"""I recently moved to a couple blocks away from the Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe, and naturally wanted to check them out for carry out.\n\nIn the two short months I've lived near them, I've dined in once but have gotten no less than 20 carry out meals -- they're THAT GREAT (IMHO)!  I've always loved steamed and lightly grilled dumplings, yet 99% of the time restaurants use super thick, gummy wrappings and also charge $7-8 bucks -- Cherryblossom uses the thinnest wrappers I've ever seen, and charge about half the going rate; they're absolutely first class, like everything they serve.\n\nOne may think it's kinda odd for what appears to be an Asian cafe serving Thai as well as sushi, as well as ITALIAN dishes too -- I sure scratched my head on that one!  BUT, it's like the staff says: \we serve these different dishes with our own Japanese flair\"""".  How true.  I love Pad Thai, yet their way of making it is no different than how many households make their own versions of things like meatloaf... There's always an abundance of meat, tofu (that's fried prior to tossing it in) and things like snap peas, yielding one of the best \""""non Thai\"""" versions I've ever had.  I've tried over a dozen of their dishes, and all I can say is I've never not enjoyed anything they've made for me to date.  I've yet to cross the proverbial line and order an Italian noodle/pasta dish, but that's only because in my being of Scicillian decent, I NEVER go out for Italian, simply because there's few that will ever compare to what my family made for us.\n\nAnd, the entire staff is as great as the food they serve, and the whole place speaks to quality, from cleanliness to the ambiance.  I truly believe that if you don't like the CherryBlossom, you're probably the type of person who can find fault with just about any restaurant.\n\nThey also always have loaves of blueberry banana bread for sale in the waiting area, and almost always they're still warm from the oven. I bought one to bring to a friend's house who made dinner, and it was almost as good as what my Mom would make -- and that women knew how to cook!\n\nFive stars is my rating, and I don't toss out stars like that often."""""""

<review>Dr. Wood is an amazing dentist. He is friendly, knowledgeable and cares about his patients. He never makes me feel rushed when I am asking questions and he makes me feel at ease in the chair. I have never felt pushed into making any hasty decisions on major dental work. \n\nHis staff is just amazing as well. Everyone is friendly and they greet you by name. When they gave me a referral for an orthodontist, they provided me with all information that I needed and also offered to send any information over to save me time. Liz, the dental hygienist, has always done my cleanings and she is such a genuinely sweet person. She always takes her time and I feel great when she has completed the cleaning. \n\nThe exam rooms and front office are clean and modern. I feel very relaxed when I am in the office, either waiting or sitting in the chair. All machinery is never outdated or worn. I tell everyone how great Dr. Wood and his staff are all the time!

<review>We visited just to see the Chihuly exhibit.  The traveling display had been to Phipps Conservatory in Pittsburgh and I thought was would be great to see it in the desert.  It was more amazing than I could have imagined.\n\nFirst off, I did not realize that there were so many different types and species of cactus.  I wish I was a local, because I would love to be able to sign up for their Desert Landscaper School.  That would be amazing!!  The lay out and the trails are very nice.  And I can't believe that I am typing this, but the different types of cactus are so beautiful!!  I must have taken a gajillion photos!  Also, we happened to go just before sunset, so it was very nice to wander around the gardens after dark.  Plus, the Chilly glass looks amazing all lit up.  A must see in Phoenix!

<review>I needed my clutch replaced and called everyone from the dealership to chain repair shops and speciality shops. I saw Mr Mechanic and decided to call and see if he could quote me a price. I spoke to Tim who was very nice and had no problem speaking to me over the phone answering every question I had. Not only did he quote me a price over the phone (which most of the places I called refused to do), he was also by far the most reasonably priced. Tim also scheduled a Saturday appointment to work around my schedule. Once I dropped off my car I also explained that my daughter had dropped coins in my cd player and my radio and door locks no longer worked. He mentioned that he'd take a look while he was working on it. \nNot only did he replace the clutch, he also repaired the short in my electrical and removed the coins from the cd player. When I picked up my car EVERYTHING had been fixed and my oil and air filter had be changed and all for less than most of the quotes I had received to just replace my clutch. Tim really takes the time to explain everything in language you understand and is quick to do what he can to accomidate you. I was also impressed with not only the one year warranty on my new clutch, but also the 6 month warranty on his labor. Just give him a call and have a chat with him about your car. Im sure you'll feel the same way I did when I decided to use him. No more chain shops or dealerships for me, I've finally found an affordable mechanic that I can, dare I say it, TRUST! Thank you Tim, I will be back again and again! I also took 5 of his business cards to refer my friends.

<review>So I guess I have nothing to compare my experience to, but thanks to a Groupon I got to take a peek at Circle 6 Studios for an introduction to glass blowing workshop. What a cool, random, spontaneous thing to learn! I would recommend this experience to anyone! \n\nIt is a little scary to be near a ball of melted glass that is burning hot! But the instructors are very nice and thorough in their explanations, so you will know what to do. They also keep a close watch over everyone to avoid accidents. My intro class made a glass flower. The whole process of making the flower probably took under 2 minutes, but learning the techniques and getting everyone in the class to do it took about 2 hours. Classes are usually $50 but $25 on Groupon and Living Social right now. \n\nI would recommend closed toed shoes. The studio is hot from all the glass heating so no need for a jacket! The studio is behind a house, there is a sign on the side of the road. Pull into the driveway and park in the back, you'll see it! \n\nThis was a cool thing to learn how to do!

<review>Used a Groupon coupon today for a gel manicure and spa pedicure.  My Groupon clearly stated work would be completed by a student as well as numerous signs within the establishment indicated the same.  This was clearly a teaching facility, which was no problem for me.  The area was clean and within an older building with equipment geared for teaching.  Don't expect a North Scottsdale atmosphere, this is a teaching facility.  All students were well groomed and very pleasant.  An instructor oversaw all work completed by the students, checking in frequently during the course of my visit.  My technician, Lin, did an excellent job and completed both mani  and  pedi within 75 mins.  There was more than ample selection of polish, both gel and regular.  I found only a handful (less than five) of bottles at half full.  I received a scrub type massage as well as a lotion massage to both hands and feet.  I would certainly recommend this establishment and I have scheduled an appointment on 9/5 to use my remaining Groupon.  My experience was better than expected from a teaching facility.

<review>"""Misty S, Amanda B, her friend Renee and I went here for our own little \after party\"""" after the Elite event at Sol Y Sombra. We thought the shady rockabilly dive vibe would be the perfect compliment to the sangria and tapas we enjoyed earlier. Like chasing Duck L'Orange with a jack in the box milkshake.\n\nRogue West is what happens when a Stray Cat music video pleasures itself into a petri dish. It has the checkered floor, the loud and extensive jukebox (Madonna and Nekromantix, within a span of an hour), and the pool tables (with red, uh, carpeting, very fashionable) of a rockabilly club, and all the dimly-lit shadiness and \""""I'm so bored please order something I'm not familiar with so we have a reason to talk\"""" bar staff that you would expect in a bar that grew up with a single parent. \n\nWait, what?\n\nNormally I'm hesitant to drink at bars. It's not the booze that concerns me, or even the price of the booze, it's that whole \""""yeah, I know that the gender on my ID doesn't match the gender I present but that's totally me in that picture\"""" thing that throws me. When Ruben (that's what his shirt said anyway) took my ID to swipe it, I felt a little anxious. It was a Wednesday night, after all, and the only other people at the bar other than us were the regulars. You know, the \""""I come here to get away from my nagging wife and a job that sucks my soul\"""" crowd. Those tend to be the people that give me the most static.\n\nBut Ruben was way cool about it. It took him a second to put two and two together, but once he hid he didn't make a peep. In fact, Misty claims that for the rest of the night he seemed to be in \""""tranny awe\"""". He kept coming to our table and asking if \""""us ladies\"""" needed anything.\n\nI'm going to be up and front right now about this. Any place that addresses me as \""""lady\"""" or \""""ma'am\"""" immediately gets two bonus stars. It's unfair and its biased and I'm a rotten bitch for it, but I can't help it. Nothing brightens my day like being addressed to like a proper woman.\n\nI mean, when it comes to dive bars, service is the only reasonable criterion. You can't judge their beer and liquor because they don't make it, and if the jukebox is too loud than that's probably someone else's subtle way of telling you to shut the hell up. \n\nRuben made stiff but flavorful cocktails and kept coming to our table and refilling our drink orders.\n\nWe were so impressed that Misty S left him a \""""California Tip\"""", which is what I say whenever I want to both praise her for her generosity and tease her for holding the West Side to Bay standards. \n\nI am a cruel mistress."""""""

<review>Any of you who read this who have ever been in love will be able to relate:\n\nThere's a first pang of distress, when the knife blade pierces the skin, when you know you are in for some pain.  But the endorphins kick in and you realize that you are in for more than you ever bargained for...\n\nAt los betos, after a few (5, 10, 20?) drinks, I had the sad misfortune of ordering a carnitas burrito at 220 in the am.  And what did I receive, but the most delectable delight ever served in the pinche madrugada ( rejoice, all my spanish speaking compa\u00f1eros, a cuss word or two to titillate you).  The carnitas were cooked to a perfect crispy exterior, while the innards burst forth with a cornucopia of spices and flavors that made my very synapses fire indiscriminately with glee.\n\nBut, not to be outdone, heartburn would make its own dastardly play for my overwhelmed nerve endings, tearing me from neck to knave with pain.  Did I stop, even for one excruciating second?  Yes, but only long enough to pour on more green sauce, villainously spicy in a way that no beto, be it fili, rol, or eri, has ever been.  Nay, I succumbed to the sweet agony of picante and used that to goad me forth into the foxhole against the onslaught of acid reflux.\n\nEach bite brought both more pain, acute, dire, and relentless, but also a sweet symphony of flavors that can only mean guacamole and green sauce replete with all the accoutrements.  I fought, and fought back hard, and what I can tell you is this:\n\nNo burrito has ever caused me such pain and yet no burrito has ever granted me such pleasure.  Like a sine curve, plunging predictably from zenith to nadir and back again, los betos has given me the pleasure--nay, the honor, of feeling every physical sensation known to sentient vertebrates.\n\nFive glorious, painful, resonating stars.  Five harrowing yet riveting stars.  Five supernovas, five black holes, five big bangs of taste.  The world has never known anything like what I have just experienced.  You too can have what I had... all it takes is intestinal fortitude enough to jump in the car with a beer bong and head straight to thomas and hayden.  Oh, and leave the zantac at home, puss.

<review>"""\Natural cut\"""" french fries are worth the visit - there's a heap of potatoes under the cutter and after you order then put one through the cutter and into the frier, and they come out piping hot and full of actual potato flavor.  So simple, I know, but so much better than just about any other place that serves french fries.\n\nSonoran root beer is available here, and you have to love a place that has a separate dedicated tap for root beer on draft.\n\nService was incredibly warm and friendly, and the atmosphere was upbeat and very, very clean.  \n\nGrilled cheese was fairly good, and the onion rings and fried 'shrooms are next on my \""""to try\"""" list for this place.  \n\nOnly minor complaint is that you're ordering a la carte and the portions could be bigger in this case.  Right now, order your dog or grilled cheese and it's pretty much \""""add a fries and drink for $4\"""" which you rarely see for just a small side of fries and drink that are paired with a main course lunch entree.  A combo would be nice, or if you're going to pay a la carte prices then I think it ought to be a larger portion."""""""
</review>
<review>This place manages to stay pretty under the radar even though it wins awards left and right in local publications.  The reason I would guess is because it is situated right in downtown Guadalupe.  If you are not sure what Guadalupe is, it is a small community  founded by Yaqui Indians that incorporated their own town right in the middle of Tempe and Phoenix.  The town is now mainly Native American and Hispanic and is about one square mile in size.\n\nThe Farmer's Market has an amazing assortment of super fresh produce and they even make their own honey.  Right inside the door you can see some live bees hard at work making the delicious varieties.  Because this market is in an area with a lot of Hispanic residents they carry a large selection of Peppers fresh and dried.  They get a lot of their produce from local farmers and offer some organic choices.\n\nI know some people who are intimidated about going here because they fear the neighborhood it is in is 'different' than their stucco and chicken wire Stepford neighborhoods,  but I have never had a problem going here day or night.\n\nOne thing to be cautious of is the fact that this town's speed limit is 25 MPH everywhere and you better observe it.  For one thing there are a lot of dogs and people crossing the street all over the place so the slow speed is safest for everyone.  Also, Guadalupe has their own police and they will not hesitate to pull you over because you think 25 is just too slow.

<review>Free Wifi deserves a full four stars.  \n\nThe layout, shops and restaurant choices are not world-class, it's mid-range level, architecture is plain, but I can't complain: free WiFI!\n\nFree WiFi alleviated the frustration when United Airlines delayed my flight back to SFO, not once, but twice.  I insist to fly United Airlines due to the Star Alliance partners:  Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines - so I suffer.\n\nThe airport staff is friendly, restaurant and establishment folks provide a hospitable service with a warm smile and genuine heart.  I'm really impressed by the Southwestern hospitality, I am so loving it.\n\nAlthough I wish I was stranded in a European or cosmopolitan airport hub, free WiFi sufficed to keep me busy and productive.\n\nIn addition to not being a world-class airport, less one star because of the crowd - male species - I hate it when I get these pickup lines and eager smiles from men (who I have nothing in common with) who even think I'd respond - yuk.  If I was in Europe, I'd smile back, or elsewhere international - oh please - leave me be to work - don't block my sun!\n\nBut free WiFi captivates this geek's heart!\n\nDid I say, free WiFi - you just made my Southwest Friday afternoon.

<review>This place is a great lounge. The place was very classy. Lots of seating both indoor and out. They have a variety of liquor. Lots of high-end brands. The drink prices are a little high, but normal for a place like this. \n\nThe music in the inside area was too loud to have a conversation without yelling. But, if you were sitting outside it would have been fine. The staff seemed friendly and helpful. \n\nThis would be a great place to go with friends for drinks if you wanted a more low-key, upscale place to hang out.

<review>"""As a \dude,\"""" or \""""bro,\"""" or \""""filthy smelly rugby player\"""" I really shouldn't like this place. \n\nAnd yet my inner case of \""""fabulous\"""" loves Nordstrom Rack.\n\nMy girlfriend, I think it is safe to say, has a bit of a shopping problem. I think if it weren't for the fact that this place is on the opposite side of the sun from us here in Phoenix that she'd be in there every weekend. I should give it zero stars for the number of times I've been subjected to \""""honey, I need to go shopping.\"""" And don't get me wrong, the first couple of times I found somewhere to camp out on the floor and settled into a good pout.\n\nThen, I think on the third or so forced Bataan death march to Nordstroms by the shopping slave master general that I live with, I found myself off of my ass, putting my phone in my pocket, and walking around trying not to be seduced by Nordstrom's very reasonably priced wares. \n\nSo here's the short and sweet of it, if you're a dude/bro/dirt ball like myself, and you are lucky enough to have someone who likes you enough to take you out in public, you might as well enjoy yourself, maybe even let your significant other show you what to buy so you're socially acceptable when you meet her friends/family/co-workers/fellow dog nuts/colleagues/people she'll claim you as hers/his in front of them. Trust old Uncle Ian on this one guys, it will help you out down the road.\n\nAlso, if you're looking to score some bonus points, drop the look of loathing and remorse when you're here.

So even if you have to \""""fake it til you make it\"""" try to look up beat when looking at the 1,324,744th pair of shoes on discount. \n\nAnd now I have a lot of new clothes that don't make me look like I robbed a homeless male prostitute for my wardrobe, which I think is a good thing."""""""

<review>I love this little pub. I love it for it's location / proximity to the ballpark and within walking distance to other establishments. I love this place for it's quaint-ness and the fact that as soon as you walk like 4 feet through the doorway, you can order a beverage. I love this place for the simple fact that it was one of the first bars/pubs I went to with friends when I first moved here (insert nostalgia). I love the beer selection (local brew on tap) + half off burger Mondays + $3 breakfasts after 10 on Sunday (also bloody marys and mimosas for the same price).\n\nMy only complaint is directed at myself for not being available to go to the Rose and Crown every Sunday morning!!

<review>I love TJs!  They have so many great products at fair prices (not Wal-Mart cheap, but fair and much better quality foods).  Nearly everything in the store is organic or, at least, a better choice than the usual junk you find at Safeway or Fry's.  Although I suppose it's possible, you'd have to look long and hard to find high fructose corn syrup or transfats here.  What you will find is a ton of great dry goods (TJs is my trail-mix supplier), a reliable house brand, a limited variety of affordable organic produce, great frozen goods with real ingredients rather than chemicals, tons of great snacks, protein powder, vitamins and supplements, great teas (I love their Earl Grey!), and their famous affordable wines.  \n\nYou'll spend more here than you would at Wal-Mart but way less than you would at Whole Foods and you'll feel a lot better.

<review>Nobuo combines unique, delectable dishes with an intimate, historic atmosphere. The setting is an old turn-of-the-century wooden house called the Teeter House. It's small, but there's darkness and mystery added to the atmosphere. The izakaya style of dining means that the dishes are tapas and are meant to be shared between those in your dining party. The experience at Nobuo is unlike any other dining experience I've ever had. The fact that it was a flawless experience with an atypical meal in an atypical setting makes me happy to award Nobuo with 5 stars.\n\nI had late reservations at 9PM and wandered through Heritage Square to get to the Teeter House. I love the fact that the area is surrounded by historic houses built over a century ago. I love going to places with history, which is probably why I love New York and Boston so much. Heritage Square in Downtown Phoenix has converted historic houses into popular eateries. Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we waited outside on some comfy seats on the porch. To be honest, I wouldn't have minded eating our dinner out on the porch looking out into the square, but the tables and rooms inside enhance your experience here at Nobuo. When our table was ready, they came out to get us and they sat us inside right next to the front door with a window to the porch where we were just sitting. Since the restaurant is in a house, there were different rooms that diners could be seated in. The house had the one original restroom, which had a large sink and a new toilet that I'm sure isn't from the 1800's. \n\nOur server was friendly and explained to us about the style of dining, izakaya, and that two people typically order 6 dishes. When we finally decided on what we wanted to order, we went with the following dishes:\n\n-Kimchi ($6) - By no means was this traditional kimchi... it was even better! More like a salad than anything, but the taste was similar to kimchi. I think the sesame oil made the taste of traditional kimchi less intense, but at the same time even more delicious.\n\n-Grapefruit  and  Hamachi ($14) - An interesting combination of sashimi, grapefruit, and avocado on four separate spoons. The white truffle ponzu oil and grapefruit gave this tasty treat its' bite. Our server told us that the dish was meant to eaten by the spoonful, as in, taken in one bite. The combination was so delicious that I wish they gave us more than four spoons.\n\n-Yellowtail Ceviche ($14) - Boy, I feel dumb actually thinking that they would give us traditional ceviche. This dish was much like the Grapefruit  and  Hamachi in the way they were meant to be eaten. Four separate spoons with yellowtail, myouga, sesame seed, with shredded taro on top. It was amazingly exquisite and I can't even tell you whether the yellowtail ceviche or grapefruit  and  hamachi was better. They were both put together so well, each of them had their own creative and unique taste.\n\n-Seabass  and  Mushroom ($14) - It came steamed in a neat little paper boat. The seabass was steamed to perfection and was surrounded by enoki mushrooms (I think) in a sake soy sauce. The seabass was good, but the mushrooms in the sake soy sauce made the dish even better.\n\n-Pork Belly Wrapped in Banana Leaf ($14) - The Pork Belly and Rice came out baked inside the banana leaf. The rice was sticky and had a great flavor to it. It was the typical white rice and the pork belly wasn't typical either. It was good, but this wasn't my favorite dish of the night.\n\nI must say that Nobuo is an experience I'll remember for a long time. I can't even remember that last time I was completely blown away by cuisine and atmosphere. The dishes are pricey, but expect to get a wonderful experience of divine cuisine with an unbeatable ambiance. If you're ever in Phoenix, you must try Nobuo at Teeter House.

<review>My greatest regret about Suite 301 is not checking it out on my first dozen benders through Mill Ave. Make sure you obey their silly dress code, or you're at least charming enough to be overlooked, and make your way up the staircase. Take note of the intervals between steps.\n\nYou'll probably have trouble walking back down. \n\nMy pals had no trouble dancing the night away. I'm more of a let's-get-drunk-and-observe-people kind of nerd, so naturally I went to the bar first. $5 pints are a steal when it's Saturday night and you can drink New Belgium Somersault like water. I didn't get mixed drinks, because fuck the mixed drinks when you've got this tap selection at this price in this cool of a club. \n\nSeveral pints deep, I wandered away to the patio. Not bad at all--you get another bar, groovy furniture, and an amazing view. Hell, you can light one up if you fancy a smoke. Suite 301 combines my desire for nice crowds, good drinks, atmosphere, and friendly staff. I like.

<review>"""An update:  I was very impressed with the owner and his responsiveness to my post.  I am happy to say that they have lowered their Drop in Price to $15.00 - Whoo Hoo.  \n\nI also would like to prop out a teacher; Todd Schuler.  I tried his class for the first time last week and LOVED IT.  He really made it fun, lots of different jumps, worked the arms, great mix between speed and hills.  My only complaint is that he only teaches Tuesday and Thursday...would love to see him teach a weekend class.  I can guarantee when I can hit up T/T I will be a regular in his class. \sprinkle of some more\"""""""""""

<review>"""This was one delicious and festive event!  I don't know if I could pick the \highlight\"""" of the evening, because the entire thing was amazing.  We were served so much food we were fighting off a food coma by the end of the night.

We sat across from Jessica, the sales manager of Tanzy, and she was a wealth of information about the foods we were tasting.

<review>I've had the privilege of flying into PHX on one blissful weekend to run the 2011 P.F. Chang Rock n Roll Arizona marathon. Finding that cheap airline ticket from HNL was the challenge in itself, but it was totally worth it. PHX is about a 10 minute drive from downtown Phoenix, so it wasn't too bad, although they also have a public transportation that's pretty noteworthy too. Using Delta Airlines as my prime carrier of choice, I connected through Salt Lake City, before boarding the small regional jet to PHX. There were some direct flights to PHX, but it was on US Airways, an airline I don't know much about, or do I really want to fly with anyways. I stick with what works and makes me happy.\n\nPHX itself is a regional airport, but is large enough to support a large flux of commuters and travelers getting into Phoenix and other destinations within the surrounding region or across the USA, if not farther than that. There is not much in the way of shopping here, unless you were to do the usual snacks, restaurants, and other pickups of souvenirs you want to snag at the airport before leaving for your final destination.  Getting in and out of this airport is similar to other sized airports, just go to follow the directional arrows to the baggage claim and pick up your luggage before heading to the rental car counter or shuttle, taxi cab area, or the waiting area for your friends and family. \n\nI definitely love PHX and the city of Phoenix and Tempe. Just like most airports, the ticketing area is very much together, unless mentioned otherwise. I do love the airline DIY kiosks, since I know I can do it myself without having to do much of anything. I normally just check in on my iPhone and print out the paper boarding pass at the airport. Sometimes, I should just use my iPhone app to go through security, just to save a little bit of time. Then again, I do like to keep those boarding pass mementos of 1st class seating, just because it's just an awesome feeling to be in 1st class rather than in economy. For now, economy works right now, since airline tickets are getting to be a pain. There is free wifi connectivity here at the airport, so that's a good thing when you need it. \n\nThe baggage claim area at PHX is smaller than I thought, but it's pretty good. The only problem would be that airport prices for food and amenities do cost an arm and a leg. That's the crappy part of the entire flying experience for me. While I know they have to make money somehow, try to find some other way to gauge the flying public, please! I know I shouldn't really grumble about it, but I'm blessed to be flying when all I am doing is running marathons in every state in the United States. I probably won't come back to PHX in the future. If I do, it will just be passing through to other destinations still undiscovered by me.\n\nFly away!\n\nB+

<review>while in AZ visiting friends i was introduced to the yard house. wow! i wish there was one in michigan. this place was amazing. i couldn't stop staring at the bar. i wanted to try them all!\n\nthe beer menu is slightly overwhelming however i managed. i chose a flight to start out and because i have never 'tasted' beer before. it was quite fun and there were some interesting brews. i was not a fan of the apricot beer and the apple cider was ok at first but then got to be too much. \n\nthe one beer i did enjoy was the breckenridge agave wheat (i'm pretty sure that's what it was called i had to google it). it was excellent. \n\ni ordered the avocado swiss burger which was amazing and the fries were killer. i tasted some sweet potato fries which really really good, i will have to order my own next time!

<review>I was here over the labor day weekend with my livingsocial deal that I got a few months ago and my family and I had a great time! The rooms were nice, well maintained and friendly staff but the perk of this place was the waterpark in the resort which was so much fun. \n\nWe literally spent our entire first day at the resort at the waterpark which has a lazy pool, a wave pool, big fun kinda scary slides and a toddler pool. Fun fun fun for the whole family! On the second day, we had breakfast buffet at the lobby grill which they had a nice tasty selection of omelet station, french toast, cereal, pastries, yummy bacon, oatmeal and fruits. After breakfast, we hung out at one of the two pools in our hotel complex and then headed over to the waterpark where in the evening they had a movie to watch while still enjoying the pool amenities. How cool!\n\nThe wife also had a facial at their spa which she said was relaxing and worth every penny. \n\nThis is definitely a place to go with the family.

<review>My wife and I live in Prescott and were down for the weekend. We decided to go to the Chandler Mall and found this great frozen yogurt place right there in the mall. \nIt is really good stuff. If you are in for a great treat that is healthy and refreshing, you will want to hit this place. It is located near the food court as you are walking into the mall. You can't miss it. \nThe flavors are awesome and lots of variety to choose from and toppings galore!\nOcean Blue is smooth and creamy and I love the self serve design.\nThe staff there are friendly and helpful too! You will love it if you are looking for the healthy alternative for a ice cream styled treat!!

<review>I always get the Stuffed Mushroom burger when I come here, beef and toppings always seems to be super fresh, and melted all gooey with jack cheese. Nice. Last time I came here it seemed a more greasy, but I give them the benefit of the doubt, it was just a 'miss' that one time. \n\nOrdered the Brewhouse Nachos once with a gf of mine and asked them to make it half chicken and half beef. This seriously messed them up and they brought out 2 Nacho platters, one beer, the other chicken. Outdoor patio had loud music that and we couldn't hear each other talk, we kept moving around tables outside to get a quieter spot, but we couldn't find any place to sit and talk without music blasting in our ears. Oh well, might as well try to finish the 2 large appetizers that they brought out! : / This review struggles between 3-4 stars.

<review>OM Heavenly G!!!  Who knew fried chicken and waffles went so well together!!!  My daughter was in heaven!!  She loved her chicken and she doesn't eat much meat at all but the crispy fried chicken had her knawing on the bone.  I ate my entire plate and so did my daughter.  And she has been asking to go back ever since.  And the sweet tea....YUM!!  It was just right, not overly sweet.  I don't know that a place like this exists anywhere in the Northern CA/Bay Area but someone should open one!  For now this is one reason I'm glad I live in Phoenix.....I will be a frequent customer.  \n\nThe inside feels like you walked into someone's house and I never would have known it was there since it's in a non descript part of town...kind of industrial.  We got there pretty early and by the time we left, the place was packed!  \n\nI have been craving this chicken since we went there...I know we will be back!!!  And often!

<review>Mmmmm...  garlic!\n\nA recent Sunday afternoon found us wandering around the Scottsdale Quarter.  It was around 3pm, and many of the restaurants were in the lull between lunch and dinner - a great opportunity to try the newest Grimaldi's location without a crowd.  \n\nIt is no secret that I am a fan of pizza.  While I am typically a 'pepperoni and mushroom' kind of girl, having visited the Grimaldi's DC Ranch location I knew exactly what to get - the White with Garlic pizza.  It is a simple sauceless combination of flavorful cheese and garlic.  Lots of garlic.  And that is a good thing.\n\nWe ordered the large, which proved to be much bigger than expected - it nearly covered the entire high-top bar table, making it interesting to juggle plates, pizza, wine (house Montepulciano) and water glasses.  Hey, there are worse problems to have!\n\nI look forward to enjoying more of that coal-fired garlicy goodness soon!

<review>I've never had anything but my nails done here which is why I'm giving a 4 rather than 5 since I cannot personally speak on the other services. But Dex, who did my nails for about a year while I lived in town was AMAZING and deserves 5 stars!! She was always on time, kept my appointments, worked quickly and did a great job every time. My nails had never looked better! Wish I didn't move away...I still haven't found anyone as talented as her. Miss you Dex!

<review>I used these guys to put in some French doors to replace some aging sliding-glass doors at our home.  They did a great job, and you can tell the doors are of good quality material.\n\n-- Updated: They were really cool about coming back out to help with a crazy scorpion problem we were having.  They helped seal the doors extra-tight, which is great.  At least I know the little beasts won't be getting in through the new doors.  GREAT service after the sale.

<review>Good food at good prices. This place has been our favorite local Greek food restaurant for a few years now. It has recently changed management. I've been here twice since the change and the chicken pita seems about the same. The previous management was good, but it appears to still be family-run and the service is still great. I wouldn't be surprised to find out the new owners were previous customers that liked it the way it was. They have only made a few minor changes here and I think they are improvements (i.e., real plates and silverware). Give them a try. We want to keep them in business!

<review>Ive driven past this place on the freeway about a million times and has always vowed that one day, i will try this place! \n\nand out of complete randomness.... it became my Saturday night dinner :) \n\nAs we park the car, we could already tell this place was packed! we walked in and there were parties waiting to be seated ... lucky for us... we were seated right away... I'm sure we deemed ugly hungry stares for it to... hey its not our fault their are only two of us.... \n\nright after we were seated our drink orders were taken by a very welcoming young gentleman. :) \nand out chips and salsa were brought out promptly too! \nThe Salsa was amazing... and the chips were fresh ... and hot!! that could have been my meal i was so content.... \n\nthis place has great lighting.... not to bright or too dull... just how i like it. \nin the middle of the place there was a huge area where they cooked all the food... or at least some of it... it looked like fun.... \n\nwe shared the beef Fajitas... they were amazing!! grilled on top of bell peppers and onions... red and white... mm served with rice, beans w/cheese, guacamole and a tray of salsa, sour cream and cheese... it was SO good and they brought out your tortillas in a little bowl with a cover to keep them warm.. but they tasted more like pita bread... either way everything was hot and fresh and out in a very timely fashion.. especially since this place was packed... \n\ni like this place alot... i would love to come back again and maybe sit near the chefs area :)

<review>"""What's not to love about Chick-Fil-A? The original chicken sandwich and waffle fries is the best combo and compared to other fast food options, its not terribly horrible for you.  But,if you are really trying to be good, the grilled chicken sandwich is good.  You can ask for no butter on the bun and order a side salad. If you really want to be bad, they have yummy brownies and ice cream.  \n\nAlso, the people who work at Chick Fil A are so nice and friendly!  They always say, \my pleasure\"""" instead of \""""your welcome.\"""" See for yourself!  They will refill your drink and clear your table and ask you you're doing.

<review>I have been waiting for this place to open. The decor is really nice comparing to those Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix. Finally good service at a Vietnamese restaurant also. The food is great. I had the shrimp and pork springrolls. The dipping sauce was perfect with it. My hubby had the eggrolls.He enjoyed it as well. Happy hour was great. I had the bbq pork vermicelli and my hubby had the Pho. We both enjoyed our dinner. We definitely will return back.

<review>I guess Phoenix is Really tired of paying top dollar for groceries. Great intro prices if you can dodge the crowds, but it is open 24 hours so go Late! Reports seems to be saying that the prices will increase after a few months of pulling people in, so continue to check the ads. The produce was super cheap and the seafood department looked interesting. Not really into the bulk foods, but for Food Preppers it must be heaven. You need to bag your own orders and NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED. They do take manufacturers coupons, but do not double them. As long as they keep the quality up, I think they will do great. \n\nAs a side note, they DO HAVE electric carts for disabled/elderly  people.

<review>O. M. F'ing. Gee! \n\nIt was so good, and delivery was so fast...like faster than freaky fast...it was like Roadrunner fast...or Speedy Gonzales 'ANDALE ANDALE ARRIBA ARRIBA YEE HAW YEE HAW' rapido, or like 'Chip, I'm gonna come at you like a spider monkey!' fast...and just as quickly, it was gone.\n\nTo be honest, I don't even think the italian beef sandwich, drenched and then smothered in sweet and hot peppers with provolone cheese, even knew what hit it. One moment, it's all safe, warm  and  cozy in its pot, skillet, oven...wherever italian beef comes from, then BAM! it's whisked off on a whirlwind adventure, delivered and not even 10 minutes later swimming in tummy acid. Happy tummy acid. \n\nTo be frank (because I guess I already used 'To Be Honest'), I have enjoyed other tamales w/ chili and cheese a *skosh* better (not bad, but not the best ever), but the italian beef sandwich today has me hooked (plus they have pink lemonade AND deliver, and that ALWAYS makes working Tygers happy). \n\nLots of delicious sounding stuff on the menu, I'm looking forward to trying the chicago dog and the buffalo bleu fries. \n\nOne note to the delivery driver/to-go order specialists/management: \n\nWhen delivering a giant mess of a sandwich, make sure to also include napkins, fork and knife. Maybe even some of those moist towelettes they give to bbq revelers. While Clinton and Lewinski may think it's cute to have a little mess on a dress, the people I work with do not appreciate it. *\n\n*Just kidding, no dresses were harmed during the scarfing down of this meal.*

<review>"""Since the early days of TCBY to today's self serve shops, I am a huge frozen yogurt fan.  I'll be honest, the yogurt itself doesn't stand out at any particular yogurt place, but there are a few differences that I think make Yogurt Builderz my top choice. \n\n1. Flavor Availability - YB offers 10 flavors at all times and typically keeps all the really popular ones (Oreo  and  Oatmeal Cookie) in the rotation consistently.  \n\n2. Freeze factor - yes, I said it.  At some shops, the yogurt is too melted, others it's too frozen.  YB's consistency is usually great!\n\n3. Neighborhood hangout - YB has created more than a yogurt shop,  people want to be there to hang out with their family and friends.  I think that's because the owners treat people like they  want to be treated.  Free Wi-fi and ample seating are great perks too!\n\n4. Giving back  - YB does community nights to support locals schools and organizations.  \n\n5. The crew - Many are students who are friendly, polite and regularly talk to customers.  They keep the store nice and clean and have speedy, helpful service.  \n\nI love Yogurt Builderz so much I go there up to 4 times a week.  I think it's a great store and I wish it much success.  If I was signing their yearbook I'd write \Don't ever change\""""!"""""""

<review>Such a beautiful venue. Since October 2012, I have been 3 times: once for the Day of the Day performance and twice for the Nutcracker. Every time, I am wowed by this place. The performances are beautiful, engaging and well done, employees are friendly, and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. \n\nThere is a gift shop, couple of bars, and bakery that serves coffee, as well. I also like that there is a desk where you can check out a booster seat for small children. Very helpful.

There were adults, children (but no screaming), dogs, and just happy people involved in their own conversations.  The setup of the place is great, from the lighting, to the layout of the tables, to the friendly service.  I can see that this will quickly become my new \hangout\""""."""""""

<review>My favorite breakfast spot, by far! You can't go wrong with anything you order, but my favorites are their eggs benedict, their english harvest omelet and their breakfast salad. It's a good family restaurant, but if you are bringing a group on a weekend morning, call ahead so you don't have a long wait! The staff is always great, and usually the owner is there, seating guests himself! \n\nTip: You can order reduced portions of their omelets and a half order of the breakfast salad!

<review>This is a hard review to right.  Again, I wish Yelp had 1/2 stars because it this review would really be at 3.5 stars.  I have been to several gyms before (golds, 24 hr fitness, tangible) and the one thing I hated at all of them were the fact that they were always busy with people who seemed to have an intimidating aura.  This place isnt like that.  It is quite big and has pretty decent equipment.  I usually go workout with my trainer (Jesse) around 530 and we always are able to workout with no waiting for having to share machines.  They have a lane pool, jacuzzi and sauna rooms.  It kind of reminds me of the YMCA downtown Tucson.  The only problem that I have with the place is the smell in the men's locker room.  I dont know if it is because they are in the basement and the sewer pipes are old but man does it smell!  The membership is kinda pricey but it is close to my house so that saves on gas right?
</review>
<review>Lombardo's Gelato is no longer in the Fiesta Mall.  They are in Arizona Mills Mall and Metro Center Mall.  Their gelato is absolutely amazing.  When they say that it is a certain flavor, you can guarantee that it will be that flavor.  It is all natural, no preservatives.  If you have an opportunity to be where they have a location, I highly recommend you trying a sample.  Try as many as you like, you will not be disappointed.  My favorite is the pink grapefruit, but coconut and pineapple are wonderful as well.
</review>
<review>Five stars for a fast food place? Hell yea. This is pretty much the only fast food place (other than In-N-Out) that people actually like instead of eating at strictly for convenience. (That said, it's still fast food.)\nYou can either drive thru, order in your car, or eat outside on picnic style tables. The kids meals make for a great snack (who doesn't like a free toy?) and the coneys are ahead of their time as far as AZ is concerned.\nThe real killer, of course, is the huge variety of drinks, slushies, etc. If you go during happy hour you can get a whole crowd of people large drinks for just a couple of bucks.\nDon't go expecting fantastic food, but do go in lieu of just about any other fast food place.
</review>
<review>I LOVE Kincaids! Especially with the updated decor and menu, you just can't go wrong. Not to mention they have an incredible happy hour. Half off all appetizers, $4 drafts (including Guinness, WHAT?!) $4 glasses of wine and select specialty drinks. This is a great place to go if you're looking for a different spot before a game or concert, even just a night out Downtown. The regular dining menu definitely doesn't dissapoint either - some of the freshest seafood and perfectly seared steaks! Clam chowder, French Onion Soup, even the salads. This place just knows how to do it. Can't wait to head back for happy hour soon. :)
</review>
<review>This place is pretty amazing. I've been here a few times for breakfast (I have yet to try lunch) and get the white flannel hash or they're monkey cakes (I believe that's what they are called). \n\nIt is always delicious. It is usually not too crowded and I enjoy the atmosphere. They're coffee and drinks are pretty delicious too. \n\nI would have given this 5 stars, but the last time I went, the service was horrible. The few times I had been before, I had never gotten this. Perhaps they were short staffed.

<review>"""Since moving back to Arizona from California 5 years ago, we've tried out many Chinese food restaurants in the valley.  This is one of the best that we've found so far.  \n\nThe decor is a bit tired with a little TOO teal walls.  In fact, when I eat there I find myself thinking of simple ways to update the interior to make the restaurant a bit more fresh and friendly.  Dark decor aside, the service is great, the food very tasty and the prices quite reasonable.\n\nMy husband and I often pick up take-out to eat at home and our favorites are the \Sauteed Happy Family\"""", \""""Crystal Shrimp\""""  and the \""""BBQ Sliced Pork\"""" appetizer.  The \""""Moo Shu Pork\"""" is also delicious and the PuPu Platter for 2 at $7.50 is a smokin' deal!\n\nThis spot is well worth a visit if you're in the mood for Chinese food."""""""

<review>Get your passport, we're going to Mexico.\n\nCan't find your passport?  Still waiting for it from the State Department?  No worries, pack your bag and head to the Ranch Market!\n\nThis place is the best!  The food court is wonderful with so many tasty dishes.  And the produce department is crazy!  2 lbs of grapes for 99 cents, 8 cucumbers for a dollar, 17 cents for a bunch of cilantro, 7 -- YES, SEVEN pounds of watermelon for 99 cents.  You can go crazy with produce and not break the bank.  \n\nThe tamales are huge and the tortillas, oh the tortillas. \n\nDon't be frightened, don't get intimidated, it's just a grocery store people!

<review>"""True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, you'll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weil's food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - it's not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrew's Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I'd like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, \Well, they're all fresh-frozen.\"""" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they're fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil's philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream."""""""

<review>Went to Cafe Bink for lunch on Saturday, and it was one of the best lunches I have had in a long time!  We had a bottle of chanpagne and a sandwich each.  My friend had the White cheddar grilled cheese and I had the Corned Beef sandwich.  His grilled cheese was full of flavor and I cannot tell you how great my corned beef was....We also had the french fries which have to be the best french fries I have ever had!  They are cooked 3 times before arriving at your table and served with three dipping sauces.  With our lunch we split a bottle of Baumard which was perfect with both sandwiches.  Also, the service was great.  Highly recommend Cafe Bink!

<review>My son bought a remote control car online and immediately broke it. Since it was under warranty, we sent it to the manufacturer for repair. They fixed it, but it took MONTHS. He got it back and immediately broke it again. We sent it back to the manufacturer, and they sat on it for MONTHS. When they did send it back, it was out of warranty. He immediately broke it yet AGAIN. We couldn't send it back to the manufacturer so it sat in his closet for over a year, a sad testament against the 'unbreakable' and 'manufacturer's warranty' claimed when we bought his RC car. \n\nRecently, my wife took my son and the broken car down to Hobby Bench. She did have the owner's manual, which made things easier. The guy in the back diagnosed the issue right away. He told my wife which part to purchase. After purchase, the part was installed right on the spot. As in IMMEDIATELY!\n\nIt's been a week or two since then. My son has been having a real blast with his RC car. I know it's just a matter of time before he breaks it again. But I know that when that happens, we can take it down to Hobby Bench to fix it. No expensive shipping. No waiting MONTHS for the car to ship there and back. \n\nMy hats off to Hobby Bench for taking care of my wife and son, and fixing the issue so quickly!

<review>"""Super-duper cool addition to the Biltmore!\n\nMost vendors appear to take credit cards. Pretty spendy, as one might expect, but there are some gems to be had (fairly affordable jewelry at at least one vendor.  Other than jewelry, this is a great place to get consumable gifts (candles, beauty products, foodstuffs and the like).  \n\nNot so great for the kiddos - some vendor \booths\"""" are TEENY and super cramped.  In fact, I had to make several rounds of Union as entire booths were filled up with 2 or 3 folks and I didn't want to push past.\n\nBottom line -- I'll definitely be back, but mostly to window-shop or add things to my Christmas list."""""""

<review>An amazing section of light bulbs for just about anything you need. Most are in stock, reasonably priced and ready to take home. I have brought in several odd bulbs that I needed to have replaced with no markings on them - They always come through like champs. \n\nTake my advice and covert your old bulbs to LED - Well worth the cost for me just to not have to replace burnt out bulbs all the time - some of my lighting is very hard to get to and Halogens are so damn hot!

<review>"""Boy was not as impressed as I but I thought it was good and worth mentioning. \n\nWe went for restaurant week, which I have learned can either be good or bad. (During one restaurant week several years ago I was served overcooked chicken on what could only have been canned peas and corn-we never went back for the regular menu) I was impressed by Lon's.\n\nAmbiance: Excellent although next time we will request a patio seat. If it isn't 100 degrees outside, I suggest you do the same. \n\nStaff was excellent. Our server was introduced to us as \Frenchie.\"""" We immediately found out why. She was thorough and thoughtful with her recommendations.\n\nFood: Now here is where it gets complicated. I had the chilled pea soup and I thought it was really great. Flavor was good, ingredients and style were all appropriate for the weather. The roasted chicken was my next course and  thought this was great too. Overall, excellent food until I tried the boy's calamari- not so much. I know many people appreciate large portions but the law of diminishing returns applies to one's appetite as well. The calamari was large, deep fried and piled high. Bloated and uncomfortable after consuming large quantities of fried food, he wasn't even slightly hungry after he finished the first course. Now, I know, he could have stopped eating the on his own. I agree. he made a personal choice to eat the fried but I think there has to be some portion planning on the chef's part as well or at least a warning \""""Caution: you will not be interested in any other food item after consumption of the calamari\"""". Needless to say he was not impressed at all with his second course, the hanger steak. \n\nWine: lots of options- very pleased."""""""

<review>"""My husband and I decided to visit the Joya Spa for Spa Week this year, and are we ever glad we did.  This place is an absolute dream!  \n\nUnfortunately, we were running late for our appointment, due to unforeseen construction on the roads, and I was STRESSED. However, whatever stress I had bottled up inside of me instantly disappeared once we stepped inside the Joya. The staff was extremely accommodating, and explained they just learned about the traffic delay earlier that morning, and all appointment times would be honored for the full length of the service.  Normally, spas will deduct time off your treatment to keep on schedule if you're late, so I was very happy to hear this.  Five minutes after checking in, I whipped my clothes off, threw them (literally) into a locker, and dashed out to my couples massage. \n\nWe were in a large suite off the terrace, and were immediately set at ease wtih a spritz of their signature scent at the spa to invigorate our senses.  Our massage therapists were wonderful.  They were extremely attentive, and sensitive to the pressure they were applying. By the time it was over, my husband had to pry me off the table because I didn't want to move.  I was officially jello.  This was by far, one of the best massages I've had in a long time.  Upon leaving the treatment room, we were greeted with glasses of champagne to wish us a happy anniversary.  I had casually mentioned this to the designer on the phone when I booked the appointments, so I was extremely impressed with their attention to detail.  \n\nThey led us to the co-ed lounge, which looked more like a Moroccan hideaway.  The lounge was incredibly relaxing that it almost put me to sleep, which wouldn't have been a bad thing considering the state I was in. \n\nAfter having a little alone time to bask in our new centered states, we decided to hang pool side.  \Wow\"""" is all I can say!  You walk out to this picturesque view of the mountain--truly a divine oasis.  My one qualm with the pool area, was its size.  There were definitely not enough seats for the amount of clientele they had on site that day, and you could tell people were getting frustrated.  Also, we ordered some spa fare poolside, and for two salads, a forty dollar bill was a bit much.  But, hey, we're at a resort in Paradise Valley, so what did we expect?!?\n\nWe finished off our day with a quick workout, dunk in the whirlpool, and sweating out the toxins in the steam room and sauna.  I even tried the cold deluge, which is basically is a cold shower.  Even after the steam rooms, its still freezing, but helps bring your body temperature down pretty quickly.\n\nOverall, my experience was magnificent. The staff was very pleasant, helpful, and prompt.  There was always an abundance of fresh towels, all rooms, showers, and lockers were turned over and cleaned quickly, and water/ice tea and fruit spreads were always stocked and fresh.  My husband and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. We will DEFINITELY be returning!"""""""

<review>I have never had REAL ramen until I came here. I had been raised thinking ramen was just noodles in a package that you boil for 3 minutes and add the contents of a silver packet (predominately made of sodium), and voil\u00e0! \n\nThis place is fantastic delicious offering ramen, udon and rice dishes with fresh ingredients for about 6.50 an item. The servings are absolutely huge, but fantastic.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I tried this place out on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. It was quiet inside, but the cashier explained they just finished with their dinner rush.\n\nI ordered the miso ramen and my boyfriend got the curry rice with a side order of goyoza. There were three goyoza to an order, and to be honest, they were small for the price.  The miso ramen and the curry rice were both very good. \n\nWe went there a week later (due to a hankering of mine) and decided to share a bowl of the republic ramen along with edamame and veggie tempura. All of it was delish. \n\nThe only downside to the restaurant is that it smells like a grease fryer.  When we left, our clothes stank like grease.   \n\nOther than the smell of grease, the place is fantastic.

<review>I lived in the Phoenix area for two and a half years and any time I go back, I always demand to go to Pita Jungle. Saying demand sounds like a bad thing but I don't joke around when it comes to the Pita Jungle.\n\nIt's a funky, artsy place with healthy food that tastes good and a huge selection of food and drink. Most of the time I take service into thought when rating a  place and while the service could be better, I still give this place 5 stars b/c I've never had a bad meal there. From their black bean burgers to their amazing hummus, they got it all!
</review>
<review>"""This dinner was in everyday one of the best I've had at any restaurant.  The service is exceptionally attentive and prompt. Also they do a great job at anticipating what your needs are and meeting them before you have to ask.  I don't want to give to many details because it'll be even more special when you aren't expecting it.\nThe theme of the restaurant is very fitting for the locale. They combine ingredients and artistic expressions from the Pima and Maricopa Native American tribes, so being from they east coast this was a new experience for me but very enjoyable.   The meal started out with a creamy soup for our amuse bouche, and then I had the duo duck appetizer (they call it \the birth\""""), which included duck confit and duck foie gras. First impressions are definitely lasting because after those dishes I was very impressed and eagerly anticipating the next course, \""""the beginning\"""".  I had the suckling pig, which didn't disappoint. It was amazingly savory and tender, and it was well complimented with a fig/date side. For \""""the journey\"""" I had the pecan encrusted lamb, and for dessert the chocolate souffl\u00e9. Both I highly recommend."""""""
</review>
<review>Let me start by saying that this is a 5 STAR REVIEW for a Sports Bar, not to be confused for a 5 star review for Ruth's Chris, or the like.\n\nAs far as sport's bars go, this is one I'm happy to go to to.  It's really big, with a room filled with pool tables, 4-6top tables where you can sit, eat, visit, and watch some games, and seats around the bar, where you can sit and watch games.\n\nAll the food is consistently satisfying. The environment is friendly and many of the folks are regulars, who have been seeing each other for years.  Great burgers and steak fries.

<review>"""I have frequented Rula Bula for a few years now and it is hard to pin point just one thing that keeps me coming back.  The food is great as is the service and I love the authentic feel of this Irish pub with it's odd ball, mismatched tables and Guinness decor.  \n\nI typically order the corned beef sandwich on rye and it is sublime.  The three cheese grilled cheese sandwich is also very, very good.  While some feel that the beer selection leaves a lot to be desired I have never really seen it as a problem. \n\nMy only complaints about this establishment are their lack of a \true\"""" happy hour and the crowd that sometimes fills it's patio.  On a few occasions the patio bar has been occupied by some of the scummy mill crowd which is a disappointment as this is normally a great place. \n\nI would highly recommend Rula Bula to anyone looking for some great Irish grub at a reasonable price."""""""

<review>The food at Alexi's is good.  Lunch time chicken pitas were my favorite, and at night for the occasional dinner I'd get one of the fish entrees.\n\nThe atmosphere is a bit odd, but the servers are good natured and quick.\n\nThe only reservation I'd have is the odd treatment I sometimes got by the host(ess) when I did not have a reservation.  I was a regular at this place for a long time.  Occasionally though I'd forget to call ahead to reserve a table.  Even if the place was completely empty, without a reservation the host(ess) many times will become visibly annoyed and act as if it is a big deal to find you a table and then put you in a corner somewhere.\n\nI don't know if everyone feels that way, or if it was only a way to try to condition me to call ahead next time since they knew my face.\n\nOverall however, other than that, it is a decent place to go for the occasional grub.
</review>
<review>This place is in a great little modern-centric plaza near Camelback and Central, and the quality of the products for the home are exceptional. Haus has a beautiful bungalow-like look to it, and packs a surprising amount of furniture, home goodies and little trinkets despite its modest size. Too bad I can't afford many of the things in here (can anyone? honestly?). I'm heavily digging the new pieces in there from plusminus studio (www.plusminusstudio.com) that are on display. The reclaimed wood tables are some of the nicest I've ever seen. I recommend it highly.

<review>Really decent pizza for the price and the flavored garlic and herb crust was just as tasty as it was a year ago. We walked in to order and as they handed us our pizza they dropped it.

For a pizza joint: great service and tasty food.

<review>Always had good, fresh food and friendly service. Their chicken tacos are some of the best I have ever had, and I will always be a customer because one time I ordered but had lost my debit card, and they still fed me and just told  me to come back the next day and pay. There are not many resteraunts or businesses that will do that anymore, and I was impressed.\n\nThey also make a pretty good torta and the carne asada is pretty good. \n\nCheap, fast, and yummy....

<review>Stopped in to have dinner for my brothers birthday.  Our party was a bit too large for the small dinning area, there was 8 in our group.  However, after a short wait they were able to accommodate us.  \n\nEverything I tasted was great, the only thing holding me back from giving a five star review is the small dining area.  I had two tacos and rice and beans.  The cochinita pibil taco was very good but the star of the show was the Aztec tinga.  So flavorful, so fat, so hot!  Man, good thing I had a horchata to cool the flames.  The horchata was very good but around halfway through it became nearly impossible to drink through the straw because of the fruit and nuts.  It was no big deal though.  All in all it was a great meal at a very reasonable price.

<review>NOT CLOSED THANK GOODNESS THAT IS A YELP ERROR! Still in biz at a faaabulous new location bigger and better than before - still the BEST Zumba classes in town - if you haven't had a Zumba class from Serina or Ryan, you haven;t had a Zumba class! And check out the Real Ryder classes if you like to spin - a whole new slant (pun intended - the bikes actually move from side to side giving you a whole body and core workout all at once.) And now they have room for retail so you can get your wardrobe workout in too! Love this place and cannot say enough great things about it!
</review>
<review>Layout of the place was a bit confusing when I first got there on my first time, since I was trying to take an order to go, but didn't know where to go..\nI ended up in the line 'for here', but they were patient enough with me to explain which area was for take-out, how I can create my own salads to go (awesome idea), and what sandwiches they offer. \n\nThe Rueben sandwich had perfectly, thin-sliced meat piled high, with plenty of sauerkraut mushed in between fresh slices of bread. Sweet sweet aroma. It was nice to go down the salad bar and choose what ever toppings I wanted..plenty of variety and the whole boiled eggs are something that I haven't seen at other salad bars. Everything is really fresh, and is very similar to a sanwich shop back in CA (called Erik's deli) for those who know what I'm talking about. But sandwiches are a bit bigger here. Bit pricey but beats me making a sandwich when I get lazy.

<review>Been wanting to try this place out for some time and finally had the opportunity today.  I didn't expect much of a crowd on a Friday morning, however when we pulled in I was shocked to see about 10 people waiting outside.  Typical for a weekend morning breakfast joint.....but a weekday?  This place must be good.  Suprisingly, the wait was short...they obviously know how to handle a crowd at this place.  Once inside, I was impressed.  Pretty small, but we had plenty of room in our booth.  I ordered the eggs and sausage, which came with toast and potatoes. The food came out quick.  The thing that really set it apart was the meat.... this was no Jimmy Dean.  It was worthy of Abe Frohman, Sausage King of Chicago.  Needless to say, I'm looking forward to going back and trying some more items on the menu.

<review>"""No, but seriously, I love this place. I would eat here everyday if I could. \n\nEither eating in, or taking it to go, the food and service is stellar. I've had a couple different appetizers and entrees and I've narrowed it down to two favorites. The Siamese Kisses app is fricken delicious and the Pad Thai is :drool: amazing. \n\nThey do their spice level from 1 to 5. 1 being no spice at all and 5 being Thai hot. Ive ordered the Pad Thai at a 3 and a 4 and I think I prefer the 3. Level 4 is definitely manageable but it kind of burns the tummy afterward.. Which is just slightly unpleasant. \n\nI absolutely love eating here and consider them my \go to\"""" for dining out. They also have a rewards card, which for every 200 points, you get a gift card. They also send you stuff for your birthday and anniversary. \n\nYummmmmmm!"""""""

<review>I love this place, when I visit Az I visit a lot of thrift shops on the same block but this is my fave stop. LOTS to look at! And there is something for everyone. JEWELRY GALORE, Glass, furniture, toys, clothing, sports, epherma, military, you name it, they probably have it. I was on a hunt for vintage clothing and was happy to see a few booths even though I couldnt find anything my size it was fun to look. Their postcards, stamps, paper, old photo section is very organized with chairs to sit down in to browse as long as you need. The staff is great there, its very secure and watched also so a good place to sell your items with good security. And not too mention there is another huge antique mall next door. This is a fun place to spend on a hot day.

<review>SkySong is fantastic if you need to rent a room for a conference.  If you need to hold a meeting or what have ya and have a speaker coming in, you can get a room for sooo cheap here.  Seriously, the room we usually get for where I work is the Innovation Room and it's not much, considering how much it can cost to get a conference room at a hotel.\n\nIt's usually around $100 bucks to book the room, then $25 for each hour you have it.  That includes your audio/visual equipment.  \n\nI can't remember the room, but one time we were upgraded to something slightly more expensive and it had a projector screen up front and in back so that our speakers didn't have to keep turning around to look at their own presentation.  Because of a super minor inconvenience, we ended up getting the room for free, too.  That was sweet.\n\nI've held two events here and have attended a couple put on by other organizations and it's always awesome.  The food spread they've got going on is awesome.\n\nIf you have a job that requires you to hold a get-together with clients, call up SkySong and talk pricing and I pretty much guarantee you'll have a very pleasant experience.

<review>I've been using this branch of Molly Made for around 3 years. They are very polite, show up on time, and do a great job. I have tried two other services (as I have never had a cleaning service before, I wanted something to compare to) and they didn't do anywhere near as thorough of a job as Molly Maid.\n\nBeing a 30 year old bachelor, I only use the service when absolutely necessary to do those cleaning jobs I don't feel equipped to handle. You know, like, everything and anything involving cleaning.\n\nEven if you only use them twice a year for a little bit of an extra thorough cleaning to go along with your normal routine, I highly recommend using Molly Maid.\n\nps. All of the ladies have been very friendly and always seem to be in great moods. Unfortunately, they are usually quite a bit older than me. I keep hoping that a trio of girls my age will show up! I guess that only happens in the movies and in imaginations.

<review>"""Don't be fooled into thinking the Arizona Science Center is just for kids. I've been both with my nephew and with fellow \big kids\"""" aka adults. Every time I go, I have a blast and it's not necessary to borrow your friend's child in order to find an excuse to go. The Science Center is equivalent to some of finest science centers across the nation with their state of the art technology, interactive exhibits and activities for all ages. \n\nDuring past visits, I've enjoyed traveling exhibits like the Titanic exhibit years ago. As you entered, they gave you a piece of paper with a name on it. As you walked through the exhibit you looked for the name and learned about who the person was. Then at the very end, there was a wall full of names and you got to see if the name they gave you survived or not. Even though I was a history major in college, I learned several new facts in this exhibit and it was extremely interactive and educational with fun mixed in! \n\nCurrently, they have an exhibit called \""""Forces of Nature\"""" where you can learn about different weather patterns, climates and how weather happens. In the middle of the exhibit you can walk up onto a stage-like area where you experience different weather patterns interactively. I won't give it away, but you could get stuck in some rainy weather! \n\nJust recently, I was giving a super secret sneak peak into the brand new exhibit launching on 9/27 called \""""All About Me.\"""" They've been working on this exhibit for at least a year if not longer and it certainly shows! The amount of thought and energy they put into each exhibit is incredible and it's an extremely dynamic experience. Throughout the exhibit, I \""""x-rayed\"""" a body and learned about different body parts, I entered a stomach and discovered the ins and outs of the digestive system (no pun intended) and there was even an intestine slide to take a ride down. I placed my hands hands on a censored area and a drum beat to the rate of my heart! Needless to say, the exhibit excited me and while I definitely am still a kid at heart, it was the adult in me who couldn't wait to come back and explore some more. \n\nBefore I go, I want to share some other favorites that the Science Center offers...the Imax and Adults Night Out! They have a state of the art, full size Imax theater on site and they show movies like Under the Sea. I am a big fan of the Imax and have been swept away into different worlds many times here. Adults Night Out is just that, where you can explore the exhibits, attend an Imax show and have a fun night out sans any children! I also heard a rumor that they might be bringing alcohol back during these nights! Let's wait and see. :)"""""""

<review>TMI has been one of my favorite places to sit back and have a drink on the patio. Haven't been there lately due to the heat though. They have a great happy hour with a nice selection of beers on tap and a few bucks off cocktails. The food has always been the big draw for me. LOVE the Sheridan sandwich! Toasted and cheesy :) The Red Goat salad is delicious with pistachios, goat cheese, strawberries, and their to-die-for balsamic vinaigrette! Mac n Cheese is a hit as well! \n\nThe service has always been poor, but that has become expected. It takes a long time to be greeted, and expect your glass to be empty for awhile before they come around to offer you another. The waitress always seems to be rude and acts like you are bothering her. Other than that, I recommend it! It's in a cute Phoenix historic house and they place cool music :)

<review>The series of 1 star reviews below is unfair, they place only has like 30 chairs in it total, in order to serve 30 people at one sitting, they would have to close the restaurant down.  I wish there was a civil service requirement where everyone would have to work in a restaurant.  The fact that these people assume they are the judges of east valley taste is ridiculous, I would hate to be around a table of 30 people all scheming to write bad reviews of the place their still in...\n\nEnough ranting.  The service here is very nice, the staff knows the place backwards and forwards and the decor is well kept and very Northern New Mexican.  It's a little disconcerting from the outside, par for many great places in Mesa.\n\nThe food is spectacular.  This is food that it takes time to make.  Pecan wood smoked shrimp, pork abodova all take time and good ingredients to get right.\n\nWe did it right here.  Had the New Mexican Corn Chowder to start, creamy and delicious.  Margaritas are huge and very good.\n\nFor dinner I had the Taos platter, Tenderloin Rejeno, Shrimp Enchilada and smoked pork tamale.  All of which were great.  I am a huge eater and could not finish my plate.\n\nWe did have room for a glass of port, nice liquor selection btw and an order of their banana creme brule which was a nice end to a nice meal.\n\nGreat place, great way to ditch the sonoran mexican food blues.  Unless you like Sonoran cheese and grease on a plate.  These chips and salsa were great, verde salsa and multicolored corn chips.  Yes!\n\nOh yeah, also very affordable, no dish is over $20, including the great steak my gf had.

<review>The guys at this location are awesome!  They are very friendly and helpful.  The prices are great!  Our serpentine belt had cracks and it was $129 to replace.  I checked around on prices, and this was the cheapest.  They even allowed us to drop the car off and come back for it.  They give us a $5 discount every time we go in.  I would recommend this location.  If they think you can get it done cheaper somewhere else, they will tell you and let you know where to go.

<review>We always have a good breakfast here and we go on a regular basis.  \n\nWe saw a story on The Original Pancake House on the Food Network and apparently the staff arrive at the establishment very early to start making food from scratch (pancake batter, etc.) so we figured that would make for a good breaky and we were right.  I love their banana pancakes and my husband always enjoys his omelet of choice.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and eager to please and it's always the same faces around there.  Like that!

<review>I am sad that Lucky's is so far from where we live.  I worked near Lucky's last year and just happened to walk in for lunch.  My lunch was so good I took a huge meat lovers pie home, which was so good my husband proposed all over again!\n\nThe employees were so friendly and explained that their pizza might take a little longer than normal, but they want to make sure it's right.  I loved everything about my visit there, and was able to stop in a couple more times throughout the year.  It's about an hour drive from where I live, but the more I think about it, I think we're going to have to go get some more Lucky's pizza.  Great neighborhood pizza place!

<review>What can you say - Cracker Barrel serves consistent southern comfort food.  All I need to drive across country are gas stations and Cracker Barrel restaurants.  \n\nThe Goodyear location is often full during popular dining times and days (Nascar in town or not) .  6:30 Saturday morning is easy to get a table.  Wait until 8:00 in the morning and you will probably get on a half hour wait list.  They have plenty of outdoor rocking chairs to enjoy the usual awesome Arizona weather while you wait.  They aren't so popular to rock away the time in July though.  \n\nI love their fried okra and turnip greens.  Not as good as my grandmother made but still worth my money.
</review>
<review>This is definately out of the way for me but I still make it a point to drive all the way to avondale just to get a cup of honeydew slush with boba, they do have quite a bit of selection as far as flavors go and you can choose different flavored jelly. it's kind of quiet and makes me wonder why it's still open but then again i never go in and sit i always take my drinks to go. \n\noverall it's a nice little place with good drinks and toast (strange i know)  oh and my little sister loves this place I am not allowed to go there without her she is 8 so i'm assuming all the kiddies love this.\n\nalso I do believe they only do cash so be prepared because there is only a bank of america bank in the plaza

<review>The first time I had a pasty was while I was in Bath, not far from Stonehenge. Fast forward a few years, I'm told of Cornish Pasty Co. Dang, these things are the best! I typically call in my order and by the time I arrive (10-15 mins.) it is all ready for me to take home. Oddly, I usually do this on days when I'm hurting from a terrible hangover. Their menu, which is available online, has so many options and they all seem freaking incredible. However, when I'm hungover I usually want something very filling and comforting. So the very first pasty I called in was a shepherd's pie, then I'm asked if I want lamb (a true shepherd's pie) or beef (a cottage pie). Lamb, of course! It was so delicious it's the only one I've ever gotten. I just can't seem to bring myself to deviate and that's not really like me, especially when everyone raves about all the others. Someday. I'll surely be going back, maybe one day I'll actually eat there and enjoy the ambiance and maybe, just maybe I'll try something new. This place rocks! The service is great and they're all so friendly!

<review>Last Saturday we left our house at 5:30pm with the house nice and cool.  When we got home later that night it was hot inside.  We have animals so we couldn't just do nothing.  So in a panic I got online to see what  we could do. That is when I cam across Empire.  When I called I was really afraid of what the price was going to be given, a service call at midnight on a Saturday.  I asked the very polite girl that answered the phone what there emergency service fee was.  Her reply made me giggle, only $69 for them to come out and diagnose my a/c.  I asked her to send someone out, they where at the house within 5 minutes of the time she gave me and had my a/c blowing cold in less than an hour.   \n\nI couldn't be happier with the level of treatment that I received. The operator and the tech where both super professional and courteous. I highly recommend this company.
</review>
<review>Sure it's a chain, but Kona Grill is a step above the rest, IMHO.  I always start with the Tuna Wasabi appetizer.  Their fried rice is just awesome, some of the best I've had.  This appetizer combines sushi (sort of) and fried rice.  I could stop there...it's so yummy.  I've had their pizza, sushi, and desserts as well and I can't say I'm ever disappointed.  \n\nIf you are looking for an authentic sushi experience, you won't find it here.  Most of the sushi is pretty mainstream.  But it you want to get a great meal and look at a ton of hotties, you can't beat it.  Go for happy hour!  Most cost effective and pretty generous.
</review>
<review>Oh Scratch, you have my heart. I love your delicious fresh ingredients. Your mouth watering little desserts, and that coffee is to die for. Your customer service is always great. My only issue with you, I need to be rich to eat you :( Thats okay though, this is one local business I will be happy to support no matter what the price is. The bread is always fresh, nom nom nom. I love eating chicken that actually tastes like chicken! No overprocessed chicken here. This place is definitely worth trying out. My favorite thing to get here is a vanilla latte with soy milk, and the chicken/mozzarella/pesto/tomato sandwich.. it is quite possibly the best sammich I've ever tasted. And a bit of a warning, it can sometimes take awhile for your food but the wait is well worth it.
</review>
<review>Hula's is bringing a needed island flare to the valle of the sun.  The staff are incredible, the architecture and layout is amazing and then the food and drinks.  Oh man.  Start off with a Pink Bikini or a Painkiller to get you going.  They are perfect.  Every time I drink the painkillers it brings me back to Jost van Dyke where the drink was invented - the Soggy Dollar Bar.\n\nThen on to food.  From incredible barbecued pork tacos to juicy burgers and even vegetarian fare you will not be disappointed with the menu here.  Try the sweet potato fries at the bar while watching old Gilligan's Island re-runs on the plasma TV.  It's always a treat to go and very close to the light rail.  Phoenix could use more restaurants like this, bringing good friends together for casual dining.
</review>
<review>I don't think much more can be said that hasn't already been said about this place. Hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I was sad to move from the desert solely because I couldn't come here every week. \n\nThe bruschetta is amazing. Tomato jam is hands down my favorite...sounds weird, but extremely good. You really can't go wrong with any of them. If you go on Monday or Tuesday night after 8pm, a bottle of wine and board of this gloriousness is only $20 bucks. Get on that. If you're not in the mood for bruschetta, the Tuna Melt is out of this world...order it with a side of Sierra Nevada mustard and you won't go wrong. \n\nThe brunch here on the weekends is incredible, too. Central is the only one that offers it so don't try going to the other ones and ordering the BELT sandwich, because you won't get it....but come here and you'll experience the fantastic brunch\n\nFree valet, too.

<review>If you like spring rolls, you have to go to Rice Paper. For those of you who don't know, spring rolls are the non deep-fried type, rather, they have fresh lettuce, mint, cilantro and such inside a rice paper shell. Think of it as a Vietnamese Burrito. At Rice Paper they have it set up almost like a sushi bar. You have your choice of about 20 different spring rolls (all priced under $4). You check what you want and they make it in front of you. The spring rolls come in all types from sushi grade tuna, to fried crab, to shrimp and vietnamese sausage. Each comes with a special dipping sauce catered to the roll. If you don't like spring rolls, I recommend the Bahn Mi, which is a Vietnamese sandwich that you'll never forget served with sweet potato fries. Or try the Pho noodle soup, or even (I can't believe I'm saying this since I hate salads) the salads are great. They make cocktails infused with lychee fruit like the Lycheejito (a twist on the mojito). You can't go wrong here, and the great thing is is that everything is so refreshing and healthy, you feel great afterwords, especially on a hot Phoenix summer day.

<review>I just went to my first show at the Mesa Arts Center, in the Ikeda Theatre. It is a beautiful venue with great acoustics. It clearly a great mix of technology and architectural style. I was very impressed. What is best to me is that it wasn't elbow to elbow with pretentious types of people which you would expect to be herded with in these types of venues. \nThis is clearly a place to see great musicians and artists. \nThe grounds and classrooms are very nice to walk and observe on a cool October evening. Look to see what they have coming, and go out and enjoy.
</review>
<review>I've been going to VK Elle nails on Camelback since I moved here 3 years ago. I've tried a few other salons along the way but keep going back. Yes, its likely that you'll wait a few minutes for your service due to the large following they have but I can assure you that the wait is worth it. And once in the chair, you'll never feel rushed. It's the only salon I know where you'll get a 15-20 minute foot and leg massage. Try going at the beginning of the week to get in faster. Enjoy!
</review>
<review>MMM Chicos. I have been coming here for years and it has consistantly been delicious. It is one of the places we bring out of town guests to.\n\nThis is a pay-at-the-counter type place, but much much better than any type of ____bertos. \n\nThey have lard free beans and a salsa bar with several different types and they give you chips to munch on before your meal.\n\nThe portions are extremely generous, especially if you get the california burro. I weighed it and it was literally a pound.\n\nThe tostadas come in a shell, and are kind of a mix between a tostada and a taco salad, but the veggie tostada is my favorite. get the guac and sour cream and you have the best mexican food around.\n\nThe California burro and the quesedillas are also really good. My boyfriends mom will drive from Apache Junction just to get the steak quesedilla.\n\nThe restaurant is brightly colored and has upbeat mexican music playing. Good location with lots of parking, and its right next to a Starbucks.\n\nAnd if my review wasnt enough to convince you, I can almost guarantee that you will see cops eating there if you go. I think that says something :)\n\nPS I think they are closed on Sundays
</review>
<review>I called about 2 weeks before our 1 year anniversary, regarding the top tier of our cake. Kevin said no problem  and  that we could pick it up Saturday, our anniversary was on Sunday  and  they're closed. We couldn't decide which flavor to chose so I told him to pick it for us. I also asked if it could just be covered in buttercream instead of fondant.\n\nThe top tier looked so cute! They chose the white cake infused with almond flavor with almond cream cheese  and  strawberry fillings  and  it was AMAZING! The random dots of fondant were a nice touch  and  the cake was so moist  and  delicious. Can't wait to get our 5th anniversary top tier!
</review>
<review>Stumbled upon this place last night (during First Friday) and couldn't find a sign or the name until we saw a poster hanging inside. Cool house that was built in the 20's, with the DJ up top in the loft (music was great), lots of great art on the walls and the bar has been built into where the kitchen of the house was. \n\nThey were totally packed and coudn't even get out to the back but it was really fun. Everyone  was friendly and having fun. The website says they offer 80+ beers, we had Blue Moons and some others I'd never seen before (which is always cool!). Highly recommended, especially for First Friday- the artists selling their works, jewelry, handmade goods, purses, sunglasses and more are lined up down the street near the Lost Leaf, and you can walk a short distance to galleries and the AZ Center (great place to park if you don't get downtown early).
</review>
<review>Last visit was a vast improvement... It is always based on the level of service.  It was really cool to see a bunch of military recruits there- always a plus.  The guy at the table next to us snagged their bill before we could - an indication of the caliber of people that frequent the place.  The server will make or break your experience - the food is good, the atmosphere is great for family, friends and/or a great night out however the experience is contingent on the service...  the park behind the place is a great view too.
</review>
<review>The Stetson Chopped salad is as good as a salad gets. They have a great way of preparing it at the table so you can see exactly what goes in to this creative dish. \n\nI have had the salmon and halibut, but did not love either one. The next time I went I was smarter and ordered some meat dishes. The stuffed pork chop was very good and so were the short ribs. \n\nThey have some wild things on the menu that I haven't tried such as bacon chocolate chip cookies.
</review>
<review>Great food, great service! I've never been a Vietnamese restaurant as clean as this one. We were seated promptly and our waiter even helped us with our order with recommendations and making slight changes to our items as we requested. We each had an order of spring rolls and a bowl of pho with drinks. The shrimp spring roll was delicious filled with lots and lots of veggies just the way I like it. My brisket pho was absolutely delicious. I don't like rare pho meat so I got the brisket and it was cooked well with the tenderness still intact. The Vietnamese iced coffee also perfect. Never had a coffee quite as good and creamy, even better than the powder packets that so many of my friends swear by. Love it!
</review>
<review>"""I had no idea this place even existed which is retarded because I live less than a mile away. The first time I went there I thought I was following some people in to a house party until I got inside and was like \oh sh*t - it's a bar.\"""" I was a pleasant surprise. Anyway, on to my review.\n\nThe good:\n\n - Location - I'm always a fan of new businesses finding success in downtwn Phoenix. \n\n - Seating: It's not a large space but I always manage to find a seat\n\n - Beer selection is awesome\n\n- Good lighting/atmosphere\n\nThe bad:\n\n- You can't take your beer outside on the porch/outdoor area\n\n- Hipsters, please kill yourself\n\n- Staff, please read above statement (be nice to people even if we aren't artists/emo/punk/goth...etc. )\n\nIn summary,  I'm sure I'll be there a lot because the beer is good and it's close to my house.\n\n*** Edited to add: Last night I went back to Lost Leaf and the staff was really nice/cool/non-hipster-ish.  So disregard the hipster staff criticism, at least on Saturday night. The Sat. night crew is cool."""""""

<review>Cheers to Cost Plus!!!! I love coming here to pick up candles and little knick-knacks for our new home. If you're into fragrance candles check out Indonesian Teak, Tahitian Vanilla and China Pear-basically their whole candle line is amazing. I also pick up ALL of my coffee here since they have unique and strong flavors such as Italian Roast. Every 6 bags of coffee purchased earns you a free one. :D  Cost Plus is even my go-to place for last-minute gifts like photo frames and wine. As a rewards member (sign up for free) I occasionally get emails advertising awesome specials in-store and online. The cool thing about these coupons is I don't even have to print them out, the cashiers are happy to scan then from my cell.

<review>This review is for their Happy Hour.\n\nMy friends and I were winding down Saturday evening and thought Trader Vic's would be a great place to have a drink.  We sat outside in the lovely patio surrounded by bamboo and a crazy looking tiki in the corner that looked like he had been scared half to death.  Still, it was a nice relaxing setting.  Our server was very accomadting and immediatly brought to our attention that we had 20 more minutes left for Happy House.  SCORE!  Quickly we looked over the menu and she took our orders.  At $3 and $5 per dish the appetizers are a steal!!  Their signiture drinks are not Happy Hour prices but there is something for everyone on the menu.  One of my friends had the burger with sweet potato fries and said it was awesome.  The rock shrimp and crispy chicken skewers were very good too.  The prices here cannot be beat.  All in all it was a lovely way to end the day....but wait.....Happy Hour starts again at 9pm.....hmm......should I stay or should I go......
</review>
<review>There's a little bit of an island vibe going on right here in Arizona.\n\nThis casual place makes me smile.  Yes, it's just a step above a fast food place, but the vibe is tropical and the food is tasty and prepared fresh to order.   When you walk in, you'll notice the island music playing, the ceiling fans turning and some kitschy Hawaiian posters on the wall.  The air is filled with aromas of teriyaki, Jamaican jerk, island spice rubs.\n\nTake a look at the menu on the wall and then approach the counter to place your order.  You pay and they give you one of those big plastic numbers to place on your table so the food server can match you to your order.  While waiting (not long) you help yourself to the beverage station, sodas, water, and the specially prepared Mango Iced Tea, which is amazing.  I just can't get enough of that Mango Iced Tea.\n\nLooking around, it seems that most customers order the rice bowls.  You choose a meat (chicken, steak, shrimp, etc.) then pick a sauce flavor (teriyaki, Jamaican Jerk, Bali Island, Honey-orange), and then your choice of rice (white, brown, noodles).   Looks really good.  I typically order one of their big entr\u00e9e salads.  I alternate between their Voodoo Chicken Salad and their Aloha Chicken Salad. I can't decide which one I like better.  My husband loves their Volcano-Blackened Mahi Mahi plate.  Where else can you get perfectly spiced Mahi topped with tropical fruit salsa, rice, and a salad for under $ 10?  Yum, tasty and a great value.\n\nIt's just a simple little place, but every time I eat here, it reminds me how much I love Hawaii and hope to return someday.  Until then...Aloha.

<review>"""Major life accomplishments:\nNot vomiting during Cloverfield.\nPuberty.\nFinding Lost Leaf\nSeriously. Nestled among other small houses, sits the Lost Leaf. No signage that I could see. No address. Minimal lighting.\nThat just makes it even cooler. Recently met some friends there for Jacqui's birthday and we had a blast. Y'all know so much about this place already. But did you know the big painting in the main room is kinda scary after a large Bastard beer. Check the third dude. His eyes follow you. And if you forget your debit card and call to ask them just to cut it up for you, he says he's required to say aloud and back to you, \Sir, you have just asked me to cut up your debit card. Is this what you want me to do?\"""" Uh, yea. I strangely appreciated that. No table service that I know of, just crawl up to the bar when your Bastard is empty. Live music from the back room is a great touch and plays throughout the house. Full of urbanites, hipsters, scenesters and this night tipsy, silly, photo snapping yelpers. Lost Leaf. You're lost no more."""""""

<review>There are worse airports to be stuck in for 8 hours with a 102 degree fever and frequent bouts of  atomic diarrhea intermingled with seemingly eternal sessions of projectile vomiting (and this is only one quarter of the way through my travel itinerary) after a night of mostly the same and a day of trying to navigate the American Aviation system in the middle of the holiday rush. Perhaps some of you recall my last cross-country travel experience (3 days stuck at SFO waiting for a flight out...). This time was not much better. \n\nBut the airport staff at Phoenix made my excruciating delay that much better by providing me with tissues, sprite (for my tummy), tons of pillows, and enough blankets to warm my shivering, shaking, feverish body. Had I not convinced them I had food poisoning, they probably wouldn't have allowed me on the flight that I finally got on at 2 a.m. after boarding my first flight at 2 p.m. the day before and facing an additional 4 hour flight. Their assistance and support helped me get some much-needed sleep while awaiting my winged chariot and made the flight I finally got on much easier than my former flight had been.\n\nI might add that there were ample food and sundries stations in the terminal I was in and I easily found all the medication I cared to take and regurgitate. I have been in and out of this particular airport for various reasons over the years and always found it rather average until this past week. Thank you, Southwest employees and airport personnel for making yet another miserable travel experience so much easier to endure.
</review>
<review>Went here the first night in Surprise, AZ with my sister, her boyfriend, and my husband. We were visiting them for a few days and they highly recommended this place. \n\nWe got the pot stickers and mozzarella sticks and both were very delicious. My husband had the porkchop and said it was very good. I got the small bite meatballs and they were very good. My sister got the small bite mac and cheese and we all tried a bite of it and it was very good. Her boyfriend got a hamburger and said it was ok. \n\nThis place was reasonably priced and it was worth going to.
</review>
<review>I've been hearing about fry bread house for awhile now. So when I moved into my new home and found it right next door to my neighborhood dive bar, which does not serve food, I was understandably excited.  \nYou know what you need whilst drinking cheap beer? greasy food.  This isn't greasy bad, like dripping and wet, this is good.  This is fluffy warm fry bread, with delicious spicy chorrizo, and all the fixings.\nThe prices are good, the staff was friendly and quick, and the food? oh yes, I  will be back.\nAlso, the leftovers with a fried egg cracked on top, a great breakfast the next morning.  really.
</review>
<review>I had lunch there on Wednesday, and I still cannot believe it was as amazing as it was. Justin Y is dead on, it is by far the freshest sushi I've ever had, and I used to live 20 minutes from San Francisco! The rolls are fun inspired and unique. The seaweed isn't overpowering. The portions are perfect! Their lunch menu is awesome! 4 pcs Hamachi, 4 pcs Salmon, 1 philly roll, a daquari and edamame, 27.00 out the door.  Great value in my book, especially for something so fresh! The guys at the bar are men of few words, but they crank out quality! I'm still beside myself with joy!
</review>
<review>I have to say, the food wasn't as impressive as I had hoped.  I had the Lobster Risotto and it was decent, but nothing really special I felt.  The flavors were a bit off and I didn't want to ask my dining companion about her meal fearing she was having a similar experience (and since I had chosen the place).  For the food, I'd say three stars.\n\nService was good though, and the dessert I had was great (Scharfenberger mousse).  \n\nAmbience was a bit loud, and not super cozy, but I may be a bit of a food snob since I'm so spoiled by some amazing food in the Bay Area so I just can't give this more than four stars.
</review>
<review>This is the best grocery store ever!  I went there today to buy one thing- mini meatballs and left after spending $50.  There are just to many good things to buy.  I love the shepherd bread.  My whole family eats meat except me so it is great to buy all the marinated raw meats or the precooked meats.  I love all the cheese... cheap eggs... organic carrot juice, greek yogurt, the pizzas are awsome, the bruschetta sauce, creamy tomatoe soup is TO DIE FOR.... frozen vegetables in a balsamic butter sauce, the white corn is mmmmmm, edamame, shelled pomegranate seeds, nuts, wasabi peas, fruit leather, wines (some really good ones for just $3!!!), non alcoholic mojito, great teas, ect ect ect. I highly reccommend checking out traderjoesfan.com and reading the reviews of the food.  You'll find new things to try no matter how many times you have been there before, I promise.
</review>
<review>My first trip went really well. All of us enjoyed the food. My sandwich was delicious. I'm not sure what the theme really is because the food isn't extremely middle eastern but it has its nice touches. It reminds me of those restaurants that add in random ingredients that you wouldn't eat if you weren't willing to go outside of just the meat and potatoes and no veggies American routine, but can really appreciate if you into that stuff.  \n\nAmbiance was very modern chill sheik. I really want to try out brunch Sundays. My only complaint was there was no avocado :( All in all a lovely meal that doesn't break the bank.
</review>
<review>OMG SO DANG DELISH!!!! I never knew this place existed and it's just right up the street from me!! There are so many sandwiches I wanted to try but I ordered the New York Steamer Sub which has corned beef brisket  and  pastrami with melted provolone, that right there is heaven on bread!!  I have to say I am huge Jimmy John's fav, but Firehouse just might be my new number 1.  They even have this touch screen soda machine which I thought I was pretty nifty, I think it boasted 101 different types of drinks; it's a Coke machine, so except coke products but be amazed by all that it does offer.  Service was great, place was great! Gotta go back and try other sandwiches now!
</review>
<review>My wife and I went here on a whim after hearing about them from the car wash next door. The place was incredibly quiet...one person at the bar, no one in the dining room. We were promptly seated, and looked over the menu, settling on satay and littleneck clams to start with, then the mussaman and curry for entrees. The littleneck clams were very tasty, and the broth lively and sweet. The chicken for the satay was moist and tender, perfectly seasoned with a peanut sauce with a surprisingly light texture. I ordered my mussamon hot, but not Thai hot, and the spice gave me a workout. We finished it off with a mango mousse cake that had my wife and I fighting for the last bite. Nettie's service was friendly and warm, and definitely gave us a good reason to go back.
</review>
<review>It's easy to forget this location is here. Tucked away between the Safeway and the corresponding gas station is this run-of-the-mill Pei Wei establishment.\n\nI usually order Pei Wei Spicy or Mandarin Kung Pao chicken. Though, Kung Pao beef is surprisingly tasty. Then, I load it up with their chili sauce and spicy mustard. I like to add extra veggies too because they tend to skimp on that. Stay away from the Curry because it's bland and runny to me. \n\nTips: Asking for brown rice and steamed chicken make Pei Wei a fairly healthy and tasty alternative. \n\nThough not the cheapest or most authentic, I'm been a fan of Pei Wei's attempts to stay true to their Asian roots (Pei Wei's Market online) and provide good value with every meal. And, I like the cool touch-screen soda dispensers.\n\nLooking forward to the new Siracha Chicken (arrives Oct 8)!

<review>So you think you have no need for a professional portrait eh? I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer. Please try again. \n\nOne day I was out at a local event being overly ridiculous and crazy as usual. Tyson was there and taking a few shots here and there. The next thing I know there's a candid of me from the event where I am obviously finding something extremely hilarious because I am crazy laughing. It was such a fantastic candid that it made me want to have my picture taken and see what other magic could happen. I started thinking about not only professional photos to put in various bio pages and what not, but a photo shoot for the fun of it. I hadn't had one since my senior pictures. \n\nThe first shoot was pretty good. Something was missing though. It could have been that I gave Tyson some really ridiculous words, and it could've been that I wasn't having the best of days. Either way, Tyson recognized this and asked if minded if we gave it another try. How courteous and amazing is that? This alone is enough to give it 5 stars, but it only gets better. \n\nI think both of us came into the shoot better prepared. He realized I really was that crazy and I was having a much better day. I had talked with him a few times before the second shoot and could see how much he had been thinking about ways to improve and to really capture me. The second shoot was amazing. There were balloons, rainbows, hearts, it was truly a masterpiece.\n\nThe soft edit process is truly incredible. It allowed me to see how others view me and what draws their attention first. It also made me very excited about the shoot all over again. I finally ended up choosing three as I couldn't possible just stick to one. One of them is my yelp avatar and the other two you can see on my blog or floating around the internets.\n\ni cannot thank Tyson enough for not only inviting me back for another session but finding a great way to capture me, my personality, and what I was ultimately looking for. He truly nailed it on the spot. The shoot was so genuine, so real. Being able to play with balloons and have a decent conversation completely distracted me from the shoot and it ended up just being me, and that's what worked. I would recommend him in a heartbeat. It's not often you see someone so passionate and excited about their work as I experienced this entire time with Tyson. I also have to admit, I don't think I've ever looked this good.\n\nIt is now that I truly realize why professional portraits are a necessity. Go get some.
</review>
<review>Place is awesome.\n\nWas in town on business for two days a couple months back and looked for a breakfast spot for the first day. Found D'lish on Yelp and ended up going there both days because the Breakfast Buzz drink was out of this world good.\n\nIt's a combination of peanut butter, bananas, espresso, chocolate, milk, proteins and vitamins, blended cold. Got it with soymilk and it was still great.\n\nSandwiches are solid, four-star worthy. But the Breakfast Buzz is six-star caliber. And the service was great. Fun, relaxing place to get some work done and they also have an unusual drive-thru, which could be convenient.

<review>we went here after reading a lot of good reviews on yelp, but it didn't live up to all expectations.\n\ni had a hot dog, which was pretty average and had, like, 100x too much mustard. also the onions tasted pretty weird. my lady liked the fries, and was bummed they didn't have any veggie burgers. the inside is pretty cool looking (no room for sitting, just looking, and waiting). there was an inspector of some sort there while we were eating in the back, which raised our brows. the seating in the back is kind of awkward, and right next to the dumpster, so that might explain the flies.\n\nstill, the food wasn't horrible, it just didn't live up to all the great reviews this place has.

<review>I am very convinced that there is no such thing as a sports bar with good service in Scottsdale.  Dukes is no exception.  \n\nI went to Dukes last Sunday for the Chargers game and it was packed.  I was pretty happy to see a sports bar within stumbling distance to my house that was actually a lot bigger than it looks from outside.  Sure, its in a strip mall but I can overlook that.  \n\nWhat I cant overlook is how downright miserable our server looked when she was actually anywhere near our table, which wasnt often.  I almost deducted two stars for this, since other friends of mine had been there the day before and said their service from another girl was equally as poor.  \n\nWhat I do like about Dukes:\n\nCheap drinks\nBloody Mary bar\nA billion TVs\nShuffle Board\nThe layout and big space\nFree Wi-Fi (No I did not take my laptop, but for those fantasy football players that must have their scores immediately, it seemed like a good thing)\n\nAll in all, a good place to watch the game, whoever youre cheering for.  Maybe service at the bar (instead of at a table) is better.

<review>"""I just stayed here last week, and it was amazing. I had a suite (living room, dining area (with full table), fireplace, separate bedroom, and separate bathroom (full bowl of bath salts provided). I also had a patio/balcony. When I say \balcony,\"""" I do not mean a place with only enough room to stand or sit. I truly mean a patio table (with chairs) as well as a lounge chair. If I opened the little french doors next to my bathtub and opened the drapes to my bedroom, I can see the mountains as I take a bath.\n\nThe bellman drive you around on golf carts, which I thought was cute. I came to appreciate the golf carts because walking up the hill was tiresome. The bellman were utterly friendly, and the service from the concierge and front desk was wonderful.\n\nI voted four $$$$ because no hotel chain seems to match the price. The cheapest suite is over $500/night. In Scottsdale, the Sheraton resort's most expensive suite doesn't even come close to this place. Enjoy!"""""""

<review>A neat little wine shop in an out-of-the way strip mall off Cave Creek Rd.  I'm told they have a great wine tasting on Fridays, but I haven't been able to make it in.  They carry a lot of AZ wines, so this little spot was the first thing to come to mind when I was looking for a bottle of Pillsbury Wine Company's 2007 Diva for a recent birthday.  I found it right away - it was literally the first label I read.  I was a bit bummed because I didn't get a chance to talk to the owner.  The website didn't list the Diva among the wines stocked, but I'm really glad I stopped in anyway - it gave me a chance to finally see this place for myself.  I know I'll be back, despite my torrid affair with Total Wine.  My relationship with this place is more of a dalliance, at least so far...

<review>1960, meet.... 1960.\n\nDurant's has not departed from that era, and I'm glad it hasn't. From the entrance along the red carpet in the kitchen, to the velvet covered walls, high back red booths, and staff in tuxedos, you know you are in for a treat as soon as you walk in. Hell, even the line cooks will wave hi and bye to you. \n\nFeatured in the bar every afternoon is a killer happy hour, with half price domestic and well drinks. They typically draw a pretty good crowd that doesn't seem to let up until late in the evening. A lot of the clientele here is the well heeled group from Phoenix Country Club, Palmcroft, and other nicer neighborhoods. It's a diverse group from 20 somethings to the about to die blue hairs. \n\nThe honest truth, as others have said, is that you can find a better steak. I would barely put Durant's in the top 10 with stars like Donovan's, Mastro's, BLT, J and G, etc. But Durant's isn't all about the steak, it's about the experience, one every phoenician should encounter at least once in their lifetime. The owners aren't the least bit accommodating either, as they don't have to be. The restaurant fills up almost every night. \n\nI still maintain that if it weren't for Durant's, a lot of people wouldn't even know what Central Avenue in Midtown looks like. I hear very often, oh, downtown, thats by Durant's right? Long live a Phoenix landmark.

<review>One word... CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA!\n\nOk...it's one word if you say it like I do. I like to say it fast so I can hurry up and get past the ordering part and on to the eating part.\n\nThis place is awesome. I ordered samosas, garlic naan, mixed grill (tandoori oven cooked variety of meats) and chickentikkamasala *giggle*. The mixed grill was good, but the naan and the masala was the highlight. I had to slap the hubby's hands to keep him from eating the whole thing...ok...by 'slap' I mean I may or may not have skewered his fingers with the fork, pinned them to the table and gleefully devoured the tender saucy piece of chicken as he sniffled something about needing an ambulance...we're so playful. \n\nDISCLAIMER: *No hubbies were actually harmed or manhandled before, during, or after the consumption of the delicious items procured from I.D.P. The improvised narrative describing the dinner-eating portion is fictional...the tastiness of the items we ordered is factual.
</review>
<review>This place is awesome.  I was walking back to Dillard's, yes, shocker alert, when I noticed this new store.  I knew I had to bring my hubby back.  He loves anything spicy, that's why he chose me, haha.   They have a great set up.  I usually don't taste stuff that is open for the general public, but I can appreciate that they offer tasting for so many of their products.  With so many spicy products, I am sure it will kill any germs.  They few I tasted, really burned, but were delicious.  We ended up buying 7 bottles, some salsas, barbecue sauces, dipping sauce, hot sauces, all of them were great, can't wait to make stuff with them.  I will come back for the Frostbite, I tasted it combined with Margarita mix and it gives drinks a great kick.

<review>If your car is worth less than $3-4k, there is no reason to put $600-700 worth of new tires on it. With that said, find a good used tire shop that is trustworthy, which is what Bob's is. For $80 I got two tires for my SUV and the owner Genaro took me back into the tire corral and let me choose the two I wanted.\nAfter driving it for 2 days I noticed it was pulling a little, and went back and this time let Genaro do his magic and he put on a different set = problem solved. This is where the trustworthy-ness really showed, didn't expect that type of service but Genaro knew what it would take to make a customer for life, and will be going back when I need to replace my rear tires.\nOne note, a little bit of a language barrier, but if you have a problem with that you should probably should go pay $600 for tires and vote for Sheriff Joe.
</review>
<review>Great place to see a show, with the following disclaimers:\n\n- 'traditional' concerts are best - if it's a show where you want to jump around, dance, etc. you're kind of limited to the space around your seat, and there isn't much.\n\n- not a bad seat in the place - yes it's tight but the place is old, probably built when we were a thinner nation.\n\n- the stage revolves meaning you're facing the band half the time.  I guess your view of this depends if you are the glass-is-half-full or empty type.\n\n- the staff is friendly, knowledgeable and professional, kind of like the Marquee in reverse.\n\n-  $5 for parking, but I can't remember the last event I attended where you didn't have to pay for parking.  Do agree with the 'get there early' comments.  It helps.\n\n- not in the best neighborhood but I've never had a problem.\n\n- decent food menu but if you want something more than ballpark fare you should probably eat before you go.\n\n- the bar/facilities downstairs are usually less crowded.\n\n- acoustics are solid, assuming the engineer is half-decent.

<review>Paws down the best kennel I have boarded my dog at! I've left Max at various kennels while on vacation and he has never come home so happy as he did from the Foothill Per Resort. I could tell he was given a lot of attention and exercised enough since he wasn't out of control and needy when I picked him up.\n\nSome of the other places I've taken him (ex: Canine Country Club near the airport) have been a terrible experience  for him  and he's come home a total wreck losing hair and seriously needy and anxious. Not this time! It's worth a few extra bucks a night to know he'll be as happy and loved and when he's at home.

<review>"""I came here for a birthday party today and was thoroughly impressed! I can honestly say it is one of the nicest parks I have ever been to. There were baseball fields, volleyball courts, waterways for fishing, a splash pad, and playgrounds with lots of cool features. The splash pad had a lot of fun features for the kids and went on continuously. \n\nThere were ramadas throughout that you could reserve which had corresponding grills and \counter\"""" space to use. Pretty convenient. The only reason I could not give this a 5 is the range of prices to reserve a ramada. If you are a Peoria resident, it is $30. If not, it is $90 which is a HUGE price difference and steep to bat. \n\nOther than that, this is a great place to take the kids...."""""""

<review>I was in Phoenix for MLB All-Star game and was looking for a place to eat after a HOT day at the ballpark. We stumbled into the Tilted Kilt for a bite to eat. Our waitress Erica was very fast with every request!\n\nBeing from San Antonio, wasn't expecting much from the Chips and Salsa but was surprised at how good they were! Very chunky with great seasoning and flavor. Another appetizer that I highly recommend is the garlic fries. Possibly the most antisocial thing to eat but as long as everyone in your party has a few, it's all good! ;)\n\nEveryone seems to focus on the girls in kilts but there is something for female customers too. All the male staff members are wearing kilts too. LOL

<review>Richardson's was a staple for me when I lived in Phoenix plus it was walking distance for me. Beware if you plan on going after 6pm any night of the week you will be waiting for a table, but don't forget to check dick's hideaway right around the corner, same menu, different spot. All the drinks are great, the prickly pear marg is a must. The food is delicious. I have had everything on the menu and I swear for the garlic platter, the crusted Chilean sea bass (when they have it), The trio plate( pork tenderloin, fillet, and rack of lamb, the relleno platter, the rack of lamb. The burger is great, the chimayo chicken, in all reality you can order anything on the menu and it will be great. The only thing I have had that I wouldn't order again was the tamales but I make my own so I am biased. The atmosphere is dark and sexy. It is a nice comfy place, very small and packed but nice. The service is always good. They have great deals on wine before 4pm. And let us not forget they serve the best breakfast in town on the weekends!

<review>Why haven't I stopped by for Happy Hour at The Vig Uptown sooner? I should stop being such a shut-in.\n\nNot that the drinks were THAT cheap - but they were good. Well, the one I kept drinking was good. (Moscow Mule - if you like ginger, order it.) My friends and I were hungry, and so we got a little appetizer happy. Ok, we got VERY appetizer happy. We started with the Double Down (Hummus and Baba Ganoush). Pro: if you need extra pitas - and you will - they're free. Just ask. (Or maybe the bartender just gave them to us because we're cute girls?) Let's go with the former idea. We then also ordered The Trifecta, Crabmeat and Artichoke Dip, and Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken. Wow, we ordered a lot of food between the four of us. Well, my friends ordered them, I just ate them. But everything was really tasty. Note: the spicy-mayo that is served with an order of fries has got to have yellow curry in it. And it tastes FANTASTIC. \n\nThe bartender service was really friendly (no, not just because he maybe, perhaps, gave us free pita bread). Long story short, I'd like to come here again for food OTHER than appetizers. And I know that there is another Vig, but I'm going to have a hard time going to any Vig other than the Uptown.

<review>"""Drinking coffee and Espresso has become my new hobby (or dare I say obsession) due in large part to the opening of this funky and original coffee Lab.  The passion of the owner, to stay true to traditional barista ways, is nothing short of extraordinary.  While enjoying one of their amazing drinks, the thought comes to mind, this is what coffee is supposed to taste like!!  Darn the behemoths of the coffee industry for herding us like cattle through their identical shops while shoving expensive sub par coffee our way.  I say no more!  I want to sip a perfectly made drink in a place that feels like home.  Cartel Coffee Lab is that place.  The sweet and fragrant smell of the freshly roasted beans lingers in the air.  I almost feel like the owner should charge for the smell alone.  Because the beans are roasted on site, you truly can not get a fresher cup of coffee anywhere.  There are no old pots of coffee hanging out indefinitely on their warmers.  Every cup of coffee is brewed fresh for around $1.  I know, don't even get me started on the prices!  Your buck is definitely getting \banged\"""" at this place.  This place will not disappoint!!"""""""

<review>I had tried many nail salon in the valley and haven't been able to find one that I am willing to go back to ...\nBut I am becoming a regular at this place ... I think the difference of this place is that it gives you a very clean feeling and look very organized in comparison to many .... and the ladies there actually pay attention to your nail instead of just going thru the motion ... \n\nEvery time I went, my nail came out beautifully .... Michelle made my nail so pretty that I had stopped biting my nail all together ....\nTry the gel nail, it lasts forever.

<review>"""Stylish and hip yet humbly manages to stay comfortable and understated; St. Francis is almost one of the best restaurants I've visited in a long time. \n\nThere are enough interior design details to satisfy our inner Martha and a menu that's well presented and executed, so why the \almost\""""? The service was off. Our servers couldn't decide who we belonged too, another table's food was served to us, then our salads and soups came out with the entrees, huge no-no. For a restaurant that's been open well over a year, these kinds of rookie mistakes, while forgivable, are just out of place and confusing. It's a fact we all have off days, they clearly were having theirs.\n\nIn the semi-open kitchen you'll see their custom built wood burning oven which is the cooking method for many of the dishes on the menu. Now maybe I'm nitpicking, but normally at this caliber of restaurant, bread is simply part of the service. At St. Francis to get a few slices of their fantastic house made baguette, served with extra virgin olive oil and sea salt ($2) you'll have to ante up. I know it's only a few bucks and really is a sign of the times, but really? So the bread was chewy and had an excellent developed flavor, okay it was worth it. \n\nWhen our Meatballs ($12) with Moroccan spice, tomato sauce, egg and olive oil toast arrived I swear there was cheese on top. After one bite of these meaty spheres there was no cheese at all, ends up the egg was so light and airy that it had a cheese like texture. This is that one dish that will keep me coming back over and over, such a taste departure from the typical Italian style. \n\nI'd highly suggest ordering the fork tender Pot Roast ($17). Better than moms, it was served with sweet corn polenta, bok choy, carrots and tomatoes, rustic and deliciously fulfilling. The white fish of the night ended up being a thick fillet of Mexican Grouper ($23). Like everything else, perfectly cooked, the plump flavorful fish was served with carrots atop a pillowy mound of mashed potatoes. If you're craving a burger, try the French Onion Burger ($13) with its smoked bacon, Gruyere cheese and crispy onions, its a beautiful thing.    \n\nSticky Toffee Pudding ($7) with sweet cream gelato, was an excellent way to end such a great meal. \n\nThe food at St. Francis was on point with every dish being excellent. I look forward to an on day when the service matches the food."""""""
</review>
<review>I really don't understand all the complaints about this place.  I've been going here for years, and the food has always been solid, cheap, quick and really tasty.  The menu is huge, and I have no complaints about the service or cleanliness of the place, either.  \n\nI usually get the fried tofu with garlic sauce.  It's transcendent.  Crispy, delicious triangles of fried tofu and a fantastic mushroom-garlic-onion sauce with some brown rice....I have dreams about it.  If I have the cash, I'll get some spring rolls with spicy mustard, which are a hot, crispy delight.\n\nHaters gonna hate, I guess.  I just wish it was open all night!

<review>I absolutely love this place.  When you pull up and valet, does not feel like you are in AZ anymore.  It feels like you are somewhere exotic (Mediterranean).  The rich earthy colors are just so warm and welcoming.  Love it!  I ordered the Pan roasted halibut for dinner.  It is served with a fine herb potato gallette, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms  and  vegetables with red wine butter sauce.  Too yummy for words to explains.  You need to try it out for yourself.  Just too terrific!!  I picked the Chocolate Fantasy (French chocolate silk on a decadent chocolate cake with chocolate sauce served with vanilla gelato) for my after dinner pleasure.  Again, too yummy for words.  This is the perfect place for the perfect date, anniversary dinners, and any romantic event.  Just one of the best dinner experiences that I have had.

<review>A friend and I visited Malee's on Main a few weeks ago on a whim after ending up in Scottsdale. I greatly enjoy Thai and absolutely expect good atomosphere in a place as well and I got that at Malee's. \n\nThe atmosphere was better than expected. I loved the lighting (or slight lack thereof) and the different booths and tables available. My only complaint was that there happened to be a girl playing piano while we were there, but not knowing this when we arrived, we were seated in an area where we couldn't hear her at all.\n\nThe staff was very attentive and I was constantly having my water refilled without even gesturing that I needed it. This was perfect because the heat and spice of the food was exactly what I wanted :)\n\nThe unique names of the menu items were fantastic also and I kinda giggled a little bit (and still do). I had an appetizer of Siamese Kisses and a main course titled Evil Jungle Princess. \n\nI'd definitely go back here again. It was a great experience.

<review>Ok so like growing up Denny's was the spot especially for the church folk and that is how I was raised until about 13, anyway this spot had it all and once when I was on a road trip with my Dad,stepmom and little brother all we did was eat a Denny's from Ca to the ATL that and the occaisional Waffle house. But somehow I stopped going to Denny's and now they have changed and this is for the better. They have brought back the free breakfast grand slam and they have menu options in $2, $4, $6, and $8 options plus their faithful standbys. I am talking about the Super Bird people the best sandwich for the last 4 decades.  Anyway in this economy sometimes you want to just chill out and talk to your friends and Denny's has always been that and so much more for me. Reunited and it feels so good.

<review>Went to @eatverde for my first #smunch with @smunchphoenix.\n\nRight off the bat, this is a combined review, as I'm including my experience tasting Verde's red and green pork from the @GetYourPHX event at @CoHootsPHX.\n\nThe layout, and interior decor of Verde is simple, minimalist, but perfect for the image they seem to want to present; don't get caught up thinking about the seats, or the tables, or the art, just enjoy the incredible food we make.\n\nAnd they do.\n\nThe green chile pork is simply the best I've had, ever. The red chile pork is fantastic, and I would die a happy man if I never ate anything else.\n\nYes, it is that good.\n\nBut wait, it gets better; they make their own tortillas, by hand, from scratch ingredients.\n\nAnd how are the tortillas, you ask.\n\nLet me just say that I probably ate about 2 dozen, when Joe brought his product to Co+Hoots.\n\nThis morning, for Smunch, I opted for a chorizo and egg burrito, because morning + Mexican food = chorizo.\n(I think that's actually what it means in Spanish)\n\nHonestly, I was slightly disappointed by the chorizo.\nI know most people dislike chorizo because it is so greasy. But what they don't understand, and I do, is that the oil is where the flavor is. The spices permeate the oil, not the meat. Sure, the meat has flavor, but when the meat is too dry, it certainly has a decreased presence.\n\nAdmittedly, I may have had too-high expectations for all things Verde, after experiencing the bliss of their green chile pork.\n\nRegardless, the burrito was tasty, and a sizable portion, for a really good price. There was a good amount of egg, as well.\nI will likely get it again, simply because chorizo is my go-to for breakfast.\n\nOne more thing; the coffee. I was informed that it was merely a generic coffee brand, but the flavor was considerably better than Denny's or Carrow's, or even the Circle K coffee. I didn't just appreciate the coffee, I enjoyed it.\n\nFor the burrito alone, I would have only given 4 stars. But the combination of the previous pork experience, the pleasant coffee experience, and the interior that I definitely appreciate, I will give them five.\n\nI will, without question, return to Verde, time and again.
</review>
<review>Best Italian restaurant in the valley, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unassuming from the outside since it's in a strip center on 64th St.  and  Greenway (in the same center as Fry's and McDonalds). But this family run restaurant that has been here for years. Same friendly staff every time...especially love being in the bar area. A little on the pricey side, but definitely worth it. Must try the ravioli (either as an appetizer or main dish) and chicken Marsala with fettuccine Alfredo on the side. All entrees come with soup or salad.

<review>I was incredibly excited to learn about the opening of this establishment. I'm a fan of Wurstkuche in LA and try to go there when I'm in town (which isn't often, considering my total distaste for that entire city) and was happy to hear that there would be something similar in my neck of the words (albeit in Scottsdale--who sort of wants to be LA but just....isn't). \n\nThis place blows Wurstkuche out of the water.\n\n1) The patio, even though it was 105 on a Saturday evening, was extremely comfortable due to the huge mister they've installed. Feel free to sit out on it..you'll be comfortable enough.\n\n2) The service was fantastic the entire night. I was sure that the evening would be a total cluster**** because it was the first Saturday night they would be open. I expected long food and drink waits and general order and ticketing screw ups. None of that happened, even though there were 9 of us on 4 different checks and we were there for three hours. The servers and the food runners were all extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the beer, the food, and what toppings/mustards went well with what. I don't know who Payton has doing his front of the house training (it's probably him, anyway), but kudos to educating your team.\n\n3) The ingredients are fresh and the food is all crafted in house. All sausages are made in house (and they're for sale at the front counter if you want to take them to go). The kraut is handmade. The pickles are handmade. I believe they bake their own bread. The pretzels are handmade. The fries are hand cut. All of the sauces are handmade (the hush hush sauce, a very close variant to Thousand Island dressing, had their chopped homemade pickles in it). Anything they don't make in house is purchased from local vendors/farms. \n\n4) The beer selection rules. Belgian prices, as stated, are a bit overpriced if you ask me. However, they have some great American-made Belgian Style options (finally got around to trying a Green Flash Le Freak and it did NOT disappoint). Don't be an ahole and order a Bud Light--which they don't have. (Although, I did see they have PBR in the can there...guess it's for the hipsters).\n\n5) The food is just really really good. Strong flavors, perfectly seasoned good. Everyone at the table had something different and everyone raved about how good their sausages were. We were also lucky enough to sample a just-crafted recipe that wasn't on the menu yet--a beer cheese fondue served with their house made pretzels. Even though we were all stuffed, we managed to devour it. Dessert was also fantastic; that drunken date cake is a must try. \n\nRumors abound that there will be other locations--I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a downtown location as it's closer to my house. Until then, I can't imagine we won't be making regular treks to this new place. Congrats, Payton.

<review>I wish I could live here... in fact on my last visit I was thinking about how I'd like to be in World Market during the zombie invasion, whenever that happens. They just have so many wonderful things that I want to eat and drink and play with, seriously, every visit here is like a brand new adventure. If World Market wasn't quite as pricey I would give it five stars, but don't let the four fool you, I love this place.

<review>I just wanted to give an update on this company. I tried to do some different programming on my pool pump. Needless  to say I screwed it up. I called and spoke to the owner, he sent Geoff out the next day to redo the programming. I have found that Companies that are established want to keep customers happy. I will only use  companies that have established reputation. There prices are fair. There work is excellent. Just remember you get what you pay for. I am happy they are close by. And willing to help. Just to let readers know that new pump has already saved me at least 25.00 a month on electric.

<review>Steak and Crab? Yes, please.\n\nFor 15 bucks? Whhhhaaaaa? Hell yes! \n\nThese are questions my friend asked, when she wondered if I wanted to go to Bobby Qs the other night. Honestly, I did not get my hopes up, and prepared myself for a rough ride home. Yes, in case you are wondering, I have had some bad experiences with Seafood.\n\nWe decided to sit on the patio and were promptly attended to. I ordered a bloody mary, the rest beers. The bloody mary was freaking tasty. Spicy and tasty. \n\nWe all ended up ordering the Steak and Crab special. I ordered a Caesar to start with. The Caesar was good. Nothing amazing, but solid.\n\nThen there came the Crab. Half a snow crab, with an 8oz Steak and a side of roasted corn. As I started drooling, my stomach did a backflip from excitement. The crab was awesome! Not chewy or fishy tasting. The steak was great as well, and the corn was nice and smokey.\n\nThe only negative...the server was a bit forgetful at times. Honestly, once the crab and I had our moment...I no longer cared..

<review>This afternoon Rand H. and I stopped in for an early dinner. It was nice and cool inside. There was a booth available to our left as we stepped in the door. We were greeted with chips and each our own little bowl of spicy good salsa. No more than 3 min later we were greeted by our hostess Crystal and asked what we would like to drink. One minute later as we wet our whistles we ordered our din din. Rand ordered a #14 Chile Relleno  and  shredded beef taco, and I ordered a # 36 Pescado Relleno (Fish) plate.\n\nNo more than 7 min. later I was looking at my meal and it was looking at me. (The fish was served flayed open with head and tail still attached.)\nONE WORD:  Yummy! It was tasty as can be, and I was glad, as I normally order a Carne Asada Burrito when I eat Mexican food. I highly recommend this spot and It's a shame Alexander and Nader had such a soggy humid experience here. It seems to have been fixed as this was not the case on my first visit here this evening. \n\nOh, and I liked the old photos of things like Poncho Villa's Wanted poster and other early 1900's historical Mexican events.

<review>Just got back from a little trip to Sweet Republic, and I'm just happy like a kid after the sweet treats. This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, clean and cute deco, very friendly staff, delicious ice cream and sorbet and other sweets, and even board games for you to play while enjoying the treats! \n\nThe pineapple sorbet and Cashew Turtle ice cream are my fav, definitely have a try! Yes, they've got some very creative names on their ice cream, e.g. I Love Bacon; Salty Butter Swirl?

<review>Just moved from California to Arizona. They say that southern California has the best Vietnamese food to offer outside of actual Vietnam. So moving to Arizona, I had to leave that behind and settle for wannabe Viet restaurants and whatnot.\n\nSo when I found unPhogettable, I shuttered to see a pho restaurant title without a number after it and incorporating a terrible pun that makes my teeth grind.\n\nBut I walked inside and hey! It SMELLS like a good pho restaurant! =)\n\nOrdered a bowl of pho tai and it was pretty decent! The broth they make is surprisingly flavor and they somehow use less MSG and fats than their Californian counterparts without sacrificing flavor. So that was a very pleasant surprise for me.\n\nOne problem is that the pho is slightly overpriced compared to CA. But if pho is what you're craving, this is the place to stop! ^_^

<review>Boyfriend and I from SoCal stumbled across this nice lunch eatery while in town for a wedding. Known for its cajun chicken and pizza served on crackers as opposed to dough and pasta sauce. We got the cajun strip sandwich and the original pizza. Both were very delicious!! Service was great too!! We had just returned from a hike and our server refilled our drinks at least 4 times without us asking. Seats on the patio allows you to take in the wonderful Old Town Scottsdale and warm weather.

<review>Okay so I'm stepping out of my comfort zone to write this review since I normally review restaurants or food events exclusively. However, I felt that Taliesin West had a great deal of rich flavors and cultural significance that I decided it was worth raving about.\n\nWell what's to say? Frank Lloyd Wright's winter home is a stunning piece of architecture that many can learn from and admire. The 60-90 minute tour is very fun and highlights Mr. Wright's genius thought processes in building design and also delivers several colorful and delightful anecdotes of a stubborn old man who had to have his way.\n\nThe pictures here are Yelp are gorgeous but half of the fun is listening to the tour guides explain why certain rooms are shaped the way they are and how the history of this place came to be. It's all fascinating stuff and I highly recommend it. Also, the gift shop has lots of neat doodads that might be worth taking home. It's all a little expensive, yeah, but if you're into art and architecture, Taliesin West is a really fun place to be culturally enlightened.

<review>"""Talking about authentic filipino food! Coming from SoCal where there is a filipino restaurant in every \kanto\""""/corner, their food is really good. We had the sinigang na baboy, bistek tagalog, binagoongan and pinakbet, for desert we ordered the halo-halo and chocolate cake. They are delicious and the kids loved the halo-halo. Couldn't help eating too much rice with all those food. While eating we were entertained by a live band and you could even jam with the band and sing to your hearts content. The owners Tony and Tess are doing a great job catering to the filipinos there in Arizona. Too bad I missed the line dancing, that would have been fun! Oh, did I mention that they have a good selection of filipino pastries and bread? Wish I could come back there soon and try their ube cheese cake, it looks yummy!"""""""

<review>Being that I work at home, I always look forward to meeting up with our web graphic designer and pow-wowing on the maintenance of our ever growing website. We usually choose a coffee house somewhere between our two homes and meet about every few months. Today we met at a very charming little coffee house/yoga studio in downtown Mesa, AZ called Inside the Bungalow. The patio was gorgeous and we had a lovely chicken waldorf salad sandwich. It was very yummy. I was happy that it was so quiet. We were able to talk and hear each other easily. I think this place might just be our east valley keeper. Very cute! :)
</review>
<review>I love everything about Pita Jungle.  They have big portions, a big menu, and delicious food every time.  I've been a loyal Pit Jungle Junkie for a while now and I have never once left being unsatisfied.  I can't say what is my favorite dish [they're all delicious!] but I will say that they have a Raspberry Mango Cheesecake you HAVE to try!\n\nThe atmosphere of this place during the nighttime is great for a date, the staff is super friendly, and everything about this place screams ARTSY!
</review>
<review>Had breakfast at this establishment on Valentines day this year.  All around a entertaining and enjoyable experience. Our server was energetic, happy, hilarious and attentive. The food was spot on as well, I am not sure the last time I was compelled to order a chicken fried steak and eggs at 10:00 am but after a little encouragement from our server I took the leap, and I am glad I did. I am not sure if they were the best ever, but they were very close. The steak had a well seasoned batter and was very good, My eggs over easy were perfectly prepared, and and believe it or not my meal came with three delicious light and fluffy pancakes. My girlfriend, had the biscuits and gravy and they were well above average, light flakey crust, and delicious gravy. Oak's is a perfect location for the home style breakfast of your dreams, but Oaks does not provide me with memories of its ambiance, if you are looking for eggs with a view, look elsewhere.
</review>
<review>Amazing selection of beers that i have never heard of with in my opinion the best music section in scottsdale! The place is very comfortable and the food is great. How to go about getting a beer was confusing and then became a process but if you are chill enough to wait for a server to realize that you are there then they pretty much stay on top of you all night. Its definitely a cool place to check out if you're in the area!

<review>"""I am a bit apprehensive being the first to review Pearls.  That being said, I am not going to miss the opportunity to be the first to give this place 5 stars.\n\nThe owner is phenomenal.  I cannot say enough about her \radar\"""" for when to talk to you, when to leave you alone, and when to just be AWESOME.  She is a lot of fun to chat with (for both the husband and I) and we get a kick out of her.\n\nThe items in her store are always in great condition.  It is impossible to leave without finding some little treasure, or big treasure, actually.\n\nThe location, admittedly, can be a trick to find.  However, driving by and then turning around is no big deal - just do it!!!\n\nPearls is organized like a department store.  You have hats, jewelry, knick-knacks, dresses, skirts, shoes, pants, an entire mens department, a kitchen/household area, nice fitting rooms, seating...\n\nCan I gush any more?  \n\nBasically if you are into retro/vintage or just having a good time shopping... you need to check this place out.\n\n\n\nAnd on a side note:  I would like to see a lot of tourists in here.  Locals + tourists = great business."""""""

<review>"""I've always liked Kona Grill, especially for happy hour.  I think that both the Chandler and Scottsdale locations have a better \vibe\"""" however, this is still one of the more happening places in Gilbert on Friday and Saturday nights.  I've never thought the food was worthy of five stars, however, I cannot really think of anything specific to complain about either.  Actually, my favorite thing about KG is the jellyfish light fixtures :)\n\nWe started out in the bar this afternoon, however, with the doors open, it was kind of chilly and although it was pre-happy hour, it was noisy and I felt very exposed sitting in the middle of the bar.  We decided to move to the restaurant side and sit in a booth which made for a much more comfortable and relaxing dining experience.  My friend ordered the Kona Cheeseburger with fries (the smaller 6 oz) which didn't look entirely special and the portion of fries seemed quite small.  He must have been really hungry as he wolfed it down with no complaints.  I had a hard time deciding what to order...I was hungry but not starving.  I noticed that they've changed their appetizers and no longer offer the giant onion rings :(  I opted for a fairly healthy option, the Sushi Combo ($11) which includes eight california rolls, and one each of salmon, tuna and shrimp.  The house salad (dressing on the side) was very fresh and tasty.  Overall, it was more filling than it looked and I really enjoyed it.\n\nSo, I will definitely be back to Kona, athough they certainly have competition in the immediate area.  Two of my favorites, Brio Tuscan Grill and The Keg are both great options depending on what I'm in the mood for...if it's sushi, then KG is the place."""""""

<review>I've been performing here for a couple of years.  There's a comedy show every Wednesday and it's free.  But enough of the shameless self-promotion...\nBongo's is a bar and grill.  There's a huge TV for whatever popular game is on that night.  (I rarely watch because there are COMEDIANS onstage!)\nThe service is ultra-friendly, especially Kara.  \nIt's typical bar food, but they have a huge menu.  There's something for everyone.  Me?  I'm quite partial to the cheese fries.  Yup.  Fries with cheese-in-a-can.  It's my guilty pleasure every time I perform there.\nThere are regulars, like this one lady who feeds her kids then stumbles over to drink.  \nIf you want a friendly, down-to-earth sports bar to hang out in, go to Bongo's.  If you're hungry, go to Bongo's.  If you want to laugh and eat and drink, go to Bongo's.  On Wednesday nights.  :}

<review>Man, haters are gonna hate! The cupcakes here are AMAZING. Extremely moist and delicious. If you think it's too sweet, then don't eat a damn cupcake! If you've never been here, I suggest trying the Red Velvet. Red Velvet never fails, and I've never met a person who didn't like it. My other favorites are carrot and strawberry, but be very careful about trying new flavors. I once tried the chai latte and it made me sad. \n\nAnd yes, the cupcakes are $3.50 and no, you won't feel privileged or special for spending that on a cupcake. Currently, $3.50 is less than a gallon of gas... or a cup of coffee. So let's just all calm down about the prices. And P.S. to those who can make the same tasting cupcakes from a box, please drop those cupcakes off at my house. I will be very impressed because as of right now, I'm pretty sure that's impossible. OH and one more thing: don't waste money on the mix that's sold in the store. It is not the same. Hope this was helpful!

<review>I'm actually a pretty big fan of PGC. I was first treated to Mahmoud's culinary talent way back in the day (late 90's), when he owned the Green Leaf Cafe up on 19th Ave (where Fattoush is today). His current location is much nicer, but the food is still center stage. One critique that I've heard over the years is that people were expecting something different due to the name. PGC is not a Persian restaurant. It is however a place for great Vegetarian and healthy options that taste unbelievably decadent; flavored with spices and herbs that are typically associated with Persian cuisine.\n\nThe menu is quite large, with slight variances between lunch and dinner (dinner has more seafood and meat options - but honestly they let me order anything at anytime). There are always daily specials which are generally based on whatever Mahmoud finds at the daily market and items are clearly marked as Vegetarian, Vegan, or Carnivorous.\n\nMy biggest challenge at PGC is narrowing down the choices to a reasonable amount of food (which isn't easy because the portions can be quite large).\n\nSome things that shine as stars on the menu:\n* the hummus - served with fresh veggies and house made nan\n* barley soup (when it is one of the daily soups) - this stuff is loaded with vegetables and barley\n* angel hair feta or spicy chicken garden salad - both are HUGE and crammed full of the most amazing organic vegetables found in phx, then lightly tossed in the house dressing that is crisp and brings out the flavors of every ingredient\n*purple shoots - asparagus and eggplant, topped with saut\u00e9ed onions, garlic, scallion, tomatoes, fresh herbs, lemon juice and feta cheese\n*herb stew with chicken - I don't even know how to describe this one, but it truly rocks!\n\nMost of the meals are served with brown and white basmati rice topped with a toasted almond-raisin-saffron mix, a homemade cugurt sauce and fresh nan. I could probably make a meal on this stuff alone.\n\nPGC has a small selection of wines, but their flavored teas are so out of this world that I could float away on them. The peach tea is like none other that I have ever tried!\n\nThe only thing that I'm not a big fan of are the deserts - with the exception of the ginger and rose petal ice cream. If I'm going to splurge calories on desert, it's not going to be on a Vegan Cheesecake. But that ice cream... my mom and I split one and the first bite I took was weird and wonderful all at the same time - by the time we got to the bottom of the bowl we were having a spoon fight that required black-belt finger moves.\n\nThis is an unexpected little place that is relaxed and unpretentious while simultaneously offering table cloths and candles. It's not cheap, but they definitely make up for it in quality and large portions. Call ahead to check the schedule if you are interested in going on a night when they have belly dancing (usually the only time you need a reservation).

<review>Very nice, clean, modern facility\n\nDuring a trip with the family, one of my kids came down with a bad cold.  Base on my relative's recommendation I took my son to this facility.\n\nDr Cohen did a thorough examination to ensure the symptoms were not serious, prescribed some medicine and made some recommendations to ensure his coughing would not worsen.\n\nAll in all a very pleasant experience, no one expects to get sick during a vacation/trip but when it happens, it's good to know that facilities  and  staff like Healthy Outlook are there to help  and  understand
</review>
<review>I have to whole heartedly disagree with the other diners here. I think this place is fantastic! We had reservations and did not have to wait at all. The service was prompt and our waiter was attentive, although he could have been a bit friendlier. \n\nWe had the spaghetti and meatballs, the pork chop, and the scotch beef. The meatballs were some of the best I've ever tasted and the pork chop was definitely in the top three pork chops I've ever had. The scotch beef was very good too, although it could have been seasoned a bit more. We had the bourbon bread pudding for dessert. Heaven! Absolute heaven! \n\nWe will definitely be back every time we are in the Phoenix area!
</review>
<review>Giddy up boys and girls!\n\nThis is a fun, casual evening spot to grab drinks ( and  food) with your friends. From hanging out at the bar, the spacious patio with stone fire pit, or at any of the oversized wooden tables... you will recieve prompt and friendly service.  Drinks are well poured. Had a few too many drinks and want to ride the bull? It makes for great entertainment for those like me who love people watching anyways.\n\nThis place is definitely a 'high energy, rock-western experience'.\n\n*please note, this is a review of Saddle Ranch as a spot to hang out, the food has not been tested by yours truley*

<review>My girlfriend and I had dinner here with my brother and his wife this past Saturday. It was packed outside so we had to sit outside which was fine. If anything it got a little too warm under the heat lamps, but the atmosphere was fine.\n\nFood was very tasty across the board. We had steak and organic chicken on our side of the table both of which were cooked exactly how we wanted them. Juicy and tender. \n\nService was excellent. Recommended.
</review>
<review>We went there one week ago, the place was packed, I'm sure because they just received an award from Food Network. We didn't wait too much, after 20 min we had our table. We order procciuto and asiago cheese as appetizers, they come with some bread and some dip, it was good. For dinner we ordered the pizza w/ sausage and sage I don't remember the name, it was pretty good. The food came quick, the staff was friendly. Highly recommended.

<review>Perfect hole in the wall Mexican food restaurant! Quint,authentic, family owned, just the perfect atmosphere.Great Margaritas! which is always what breaks or makes a Mexican restaurant for me. My friends and I split some awesome oysters which i was apprehensive about at first, just because this place really is the definition of 'hole in the wall,' but they turned out to be great... then again it was my first experience eating oysters... We all ordered burritos which were also very good, I love a place that isn't afraid to use dark meat chicken. I mean why do restaurants always advertise white meat chicken anyways?  that's what usually steers me away from ever ordering chicken in the first place! For sure gotta come back to try more of their menu!

<review>I could not be happier with this preschool. My first child is going to graduate to kindergarten this year and my second will be in the 3's class next year.  The teachers are outstanding.  After researching so many other preschools the thing about this preschool that makes it stand out is the community and the parent education.  As a first time parent not only was I not ready to send my child off to school and not be part of it but there was so much I didn't know.  Since this school is a co-op I was able to carry through with what my son learned at school and reinforce it at home.  I learned so much from the expert teachers.  In addition, I have formed close bonds to the other co-oping parents.  I can't think of a better way to model a sense of community to my children than to actually live it.  The school offers a developmentally appropriate curriculum and allows children to learn through play.  I could go on and on about this school and it's community!

<review>I agree with Alicia.  the club has some downfalls but its the only place to hear world class DJ's in arizona.  I love house music and unfortunately this is one of the few places to hear unadulterated house music without a lil john song thrown in.  \nDance floor is small, especially when big DJ's are in town.  \nThere is a lax dress code so the club isn't all that uppity which can be a nice change.  \nNever been there on any night but a friday. \nThe gogo dancers are easy on the eyes as well.  \n4 stars for the effort they put out to bring in world class DJ's like Desyn Masiello.  I'd give it 3 for everything else.
</review>
<review>Place is pretty good after new ownership took affect. Pretty clean and organized. I would give the food 4/5 stars. Better than most chinese buffet places. Looks like all employees are actually Chinese. Your drink is always filled since they check up on it regularly. I actually had more than I could drink they filled it so often. Prices are good at $6.99 per person during lunch. Dinner is $9.99 per person. Children 3-5 is $2.99 as the check said. Soda is $1.49. And guess what, REAL ICE CREAM. We were pretty happy about that. Worth it.

<review>After spending a lovely day looking at musical instruments, or enjoying one of the concerts the MIM has, what better way to finish off your experience than to get lunch at this delectable cafe?  The food here has an emphasis on sustainable and locally produced food.  They have a lot of unique dishes here, and the menu changes daily.  Some examples include ahi tuna and caviar pizza, braised beef with potatoes, and unusual (and tasty) dessert such as chilled rhubarb soup with cake squares.  The portions are very filling, and service is excellent for a cafeteria style establishment.  Some of the dishes can be hit and miss, but I give them points for trying at least.  For instance, the tuna on the pizza I tried was a little overcooked and a little fishy tasting for me, and a chicken sandwich I had was bordering on the dry side.  The beef I have had here though has been very tender and flavorful so far though.  The cafeteria itself is in an open, airy, sunny locale, which provides a good view of the outdoors while you eat your meal.

<review>They did a fantastic job renovating this place. It's a great place for a special occasion. My friend had his wedding here... it's a perfect spot. The bar area is neat, but way overpriced. It's a little hoity toity for me as well... if you've got that kind of money, you would probably like it.\n\nThe pool area is nice, but frequently crowded with what appears to be Mtv Spring Breakers or models. Actually - crowds depend on time of day/week/month/year... The rooms are quite nice and once they finish construction next door, the views will be good again. I don't like to valet my car, so I'm not a fan of the parking situation. The Ho makes a great backdrop for photo shoots as well. \n\nI think if you have wealthy family or friends in town, this is one of the better options available. It's also good to meet some friends at the bar if you've got the dough and want to play dress-up. I'm glad they decided to keep it around... I'm kinda upset though that they changed the Valley Ho sign on the corner of 68th and Indian School... after all that work to renovate the place, they finally lose that sign that has been there since I can remember. Pity.

<review>Went there last night with a group of 32, for a special family celebration. I heard through Facebook of the excellent food and great selection of beers, gotta tell you we were not disappointed the food was soooo good that several members of our party requested to meet the chef, our waiter went to the kitchen and soon we were speaking with chef Diego, what a true professional who took the time to explain the dishes and their origins. A great experience and I look forward to returning.
</review>
<review>Went here yesterday with the family to celebrate a birthday and it was amazing. This is my second time to City Hall and we will definitely be back! The service is outstanding and they do a great job accommodating and helping you make your way around the menu, etc. We started with cocktails and our server recommended a drink not listed on the menu; a cherry lemon drop. It was delicious and the presentation was great, too. It comes out similar to the seafood tower and is so cold the drink bubbles when they put it in the glass. Very cool. We got the seafood tower where they will give you almost any number you like for each option, which is certainly helpful when you have a table of people who can't decide! \n\nFor the meal we got a variety of their steaks: ribeye, porterhouse, KC strip and all were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Absolutely delicious! Our family is in the meat business and my dad said it was one of the best steaks he had ever had. We shared the lobster mashed potatoes (amazing!) and some mushrooms. All in all it was a great place to have a celebration!

<review>I had a problem with a pc that I purchased from the Microsoft store. Worst case scenario, or so I thought. I contacted customer support. I spoke with a few people who were all very helpful and pleasant but could not fix the problem. I  was the put in contact with William Zollicoffer a support  agent. I was able to return my pc with out incident. The agent followed my problem start to finish via telephone and email.  After having many customer support problems with other companies this was a great breath of fresh air. Microsoft seems to hire employees who care about the customer. I will use the Microsoft store in the future and recommend the store to my friends and family.

<review>Anytime I can't hitch a ride to the airport I always park at PreFlight.  Why?  Because it takes much less time than parking at the airport itself, it's cheaper (check out the coupons on the website!) and they have a Frequent Parker Program so I earn a free day for every five days parked.  Now, I always liked PreFlight but last week I decided that I love them because after returning from an awesome weekend in Vegas I hopped on the PreFlight shuttle bus (which comes every few minutes) and arrived at the lot to find a sad car with a dead battery.\n\nIt was hot and I was in no mood to play games with my car.  I tried and tried but I couldn't get her to come to life.  Within seconds a PreFlight staffer drove up out of nowhere in a golfcart with a portable jumper cable box and revived my car so I could get a move on.  Talk about service!  Had I parked at the airport I'm not sure how long I would have been stranded!

<review>I've been here a couple of times and just haven't had the chance to review it.\n\nI always thought the food was great. I normally get the carne asada burrito and it is definitely good. My girlfriend gets two carne asada tacos and she loves it! Everything comes out nice and hot. The beef is seasoned well and the dish itself, at least for the burrito, looks very appetizing (the tacos come out wrapped in foil). The service is decent and not great because they are usually very crowded. The margarita is apparently very strong. I only took a sip of my girlfriend's just to try it and thought $5 was well worth the price. She was buzzing by the end of the night even though she ate.\n\nI have yet to try their other dishes and drinks but I will be back, that's for sure!
</review>
<review>Awesome steaks. This place has certainly changed over the years. It has recently been updated and given a face lift, but the top rate service and food has remained a constant. Ryan, if you are looking for cheap, tough meat Monti's in Tempe is fine, but if you are looking for something a bit more refined this is the place. The Prime Rib is one of the best in town. Some people are dressed up and others are in Jeans or nice shorts.

<review>This is by far one of our favorite parks.  Have you seen the covered jungle gym?  It is awesome!\n\nWe love coming here.  My son could play here for hours.  We also ride our bikes along the path.  You can stay on the paved walkway or follow the dirt trail that would lead you along the perimeter of the park.  \n\nThere are several huge ramadas and smaller ramadas around the playground to reserve for parties.\n\nThe recreation center is beautiful.  So many classes are offered here.  They even do family events several evenings a week!  All kinds of activities for toddlers, children, teenagers and adults!  Check out the website for more info on this.\n\nCome summertime, if your kid is bouncing still off the walls in the eve, take them here to tire them out!  \n\nI highly recommend this place.  Just don't tell too many people!

<review>Ok I say this every time, but I do not like to make a habit of giving a place 5 stars in my first try, but at Fate I can't help myself. Everything from the ambiance, food, happy hour, beer, and even cake pops were simply amazing!!,\n\nI'll start with my favorite, beer. We got here early during happy hour and thought that my wife and I would order 2 beers each. So I ordered the Smoked Porter and she had Imperial IPA. Trying these I would say the imperial IPA was really good. 8.5 100lbu. Very tasty! The smoked porter was great too. Not really my thing but with food it tasted good. A little on the over smoked flavor but I respect that. After we had the pale ale and Irish Red. The pale ale was 6.0 and it was more on par of average IPA.  The Irish Red was amazing! A strong but refreshing red. This was my wife's favorite beer. Mine has to be the imperial IPA. \n\nDuring HH we ordered the pizza bread very good. Basically cheese bread on their pizza dough. It came with a side of marinara. I would total order it again next time we are at HH\n\nWe then decided to order a pizza to share. We chose the rustic pizza which including artichoke hearts, fennel,sausage, gorgonzola cheese. I thought it was excellent pizza! Even better with a craft beer next to you. \n\nAnyways our experience at Fate was excellent. Id like to add that the service was excellent and liked the layout of the restaurant and the small brew tanks. This place is small but seems like a lot of room at the bar and a decent sized patio.  \n\nOh one more thing, when we were walking out, my wife spotted the cake pop display. We had to turn around and ordered 2! 2 bucks each and well worth it!! We tried the sinker doodle and peppermint red velvet. The red velvet was the best! A little harder shell but once you ate more they were very moist. Do your self a favor and order at least one on your way out!!
</review>
<review>Best. Frozen. Yogurt. Place. Ever. Period.\n\nLove that they change up the flavors every now and then. The seasonal oatmeal raisin and pumpkin flavors are amazing. They let you control all your toppings (NOT like that other place). They also have seasonal toppings too. Right now they have Cracker Jacks as toppings to celebrate baseball spring training Cactus League.  If the number of flavors overwhelms you, there are free sample cups that you can pick up at the register upon entering the shop.  The price per ounce is also very reasonable. I love this place and I always try to think of excuses to come here :) \n\nI can't wait to take my sister here when she comes to visit me!
</review>
<review>A simple, healthy, pleasant meal without pretense in the Scotts Rd/Frank Lloyd Wright neighborhood.  Yeah, right - it doesn't exist except at Miracle Mile.  Anytime we want to eat, we always have to choose between spending over an hour doing it (between waiting for a table and service focused on upsell), gut busting food or driving 15 minutes away (back to the hour plus).  Miracle Mile has great diversity on their menu, gets you in and out, and has tons of seating in a pretty pleasant and very clean dining area.  Miracle Mile probably isn't worth driving out of my way for, but I'm sure glad it's nearby.
</review>
<review>There are very few places who can get me to eat chicken that is not boneless/skinless and this is one of them! Not only can they get me to eat it, the jerk chicken here can get me to drive across town on my lunch hour just to indulge. Generous portions of juicy, tender, flavorful chicken piled in one corner of a styrofoam take out tray partnered with loads of rice (flavors vary, for example: rice and beans or pumpkin rice) and your choice of plantains or (my choice) steamed cabbage for about $10 with a drink. The cabbage is still crisp and firm and a nice, mild crunch to go with the rest of the meal. The staff is incredibly friendly. Seating is very limited (stools facing a narrow counter that runs the perimeter of the small restaurant's space) -- but, in a way that makes it convenient to eat alone and be left to stuff your face! \n\nBYO wet wipes though, fair warning!
</review>
<review>This place is right down the street from my new office, and thank goodness! They have a wide range of baked goods, including gourmet breads and pastries, cookies, and other goodies (even fresh hummus!), as well as great iced tea and other drinks. I walked down there today and got a wonderfully delicious sandwich on their fresh 9-grain bread, along with chips and a drink for under $8. The staff and owner are all friendly, the place is charming and has dine-in seating indoors or on the patio, and they make it fast and fresh. Thanks, Bread Basket! You guys are awesome. I'll be coming in more often for sure.

<review>Rosati's is a Chicagoland staple. I used to order from Rosati's about every week around the mid 80's until they went downhill. Twenty years later I find out that the owner's from the Rosati's I used to patronize moved to Arizona. Ok - that explains everything.\n\nWe ordered a couple of large pizzas for delivery yesterday when we had some friends over. We ordered a thin crust sausage, onion and greenpepper which was delicious and a half pepperoni and half vegetarian which I was told was excellent. They even delivered on time, we asked for a 6pm delivery and they delivered. Best pizza in the Biltmore area.
</review>
<review>The Auld Dubliner is a welcome change in the chanification that is the West Valley.  They do have a few other locations (one in Tucson, another in Colorado) but this place doesn't have that chain style feel.  The menu claims that the interior was imported from Ireland and that the inside setup is authentic to Ireland.  I've never been so I can't speak to that, but the interior is eclectic and fun.\n\nThe people that work at the Dubliner were friendly.  Full disclosure, I went here to see a friend who works there as a server and had her schedule time wrong.  The staff was super friendly and still got us what we needed, knowing full well that she would be getting any tips from our table.  \n\nThey have an 'early bird special which gives you an option of the Irish fare in smaller portions for a smaller price.  You get a choice of soup or salad and a small dessert with this option, all for $9.95.  A pretty decent deal for all the food you get.\n\nI had the fish and chips early bird special, pretty much the only thing that sounded half appetizing to me.  Irish food is typically quite meaty, so options are always limited at such institutions for me.  They also have Hooegarden on tap which pushed them to the four star rating for me.

<review>Went on a Monday night and it was very quiet as far as people go, but they play punk, ska, and similar on the speakers. After sports were over (around 10), the barkeep put on some Japanese gore movie on the DVD that was very entertaining. Prices seemed fair, even cheap. Very friendly bartender and seemed like a great place to just hang out with friends and play pool or chat. Probably wouldn't go here on a busier night like a weekend but it was nice tonight. And, bonus, they have absinthe!

<review>It isn't trendy.  It isn't fancy.  The chef isn't famous.  It is just plain good.\n\nI like Red Devil.  It is one of those places where ordering way too much pizza on purpose in order to enjoy it again for lunch the next day is perfectly normal and A-OK.  The service is consistently friendly, attentive, and happy to offer menu suggestions.  \n\nI can't comment on their wide variety of main dishes (which all look appetizing), because I can never tear myself away from the pizza.  What goes great with that pizza?  The Antipasto salad is fantastic - loaded with meats, cheese and even my favorite artichoke hearts.  A small is more than ample for two people to share.  Save some of that Italian dressing (presented on the side) to use as a dipping sauce for your pizza crust.  Instant breadsticks!  Speaking of pizza, Red Devil's graces a thin yet doughy crust with tangy sauce and generous evenly-distributed toppings.  My favorite, pepperoni and mushroom, tastes wonderful when re-heated for lunch the next day too!\n\nGo, sit in one of the bar's padded booths.  Enjoy an adult beverage or two (there are typically drink specials of some kind or another) and order a pizza big enough to take some home.  :)

<review>I did write an update giving 5 stars but then we went tonight and I had to take it back. We ordered an appetizer, salad, and sandwich to share plus a burger for our two year old. It all came out at the same time. That is a huge pet peeve of mine at restaurants, Our table was so full we had no room for our plates, we had to eat the hot sandwich first, then the hot appetizer (which was almost cold by that time) and then the salad. And try to keep the hot plates away from our kiddo. Not cool. How difficult is it for them to understand, one dish at a time in a timely manner unless otherwise specified. Still love it there, next time we will have to ask and be more specific.

<review>I met a friend here for brunch on Sunday, and it was a good breakfast spot. It was CRAZY busy though! But, it's order at the counter style, so no matter how busy it is, you can get your order in. Then the only problem is finding a table. We finally got one, but it was RIGHT by the main entrance, so not the best feng shui. \n\nPROS: The patio is dog-friendly, it's a happening spot, they have a unique menu, and you can get your order in right away.\n\nCONS: Parking is a nightmare. It's really packed. They call your name when your order is ready and it's IMPOSSIBLE to hear them call you when it's busy, so if you're not waiting right by the kitchen, your food will get cold! Mine did. Also, strangely, the tables do not have salt and pepper on them...so...um...bring your own??? idk. I like to put salt and pepper on my eggs, but there wasn't any on the table! Also, NO HOT SAUCE! I asked the woman at the counter for hot sauce, and she seemed surprised! She said to ask the people at the coffee counter....weird. Um...no...they did not have any hot sauce at the coffee counter. I'd still go back again, but I would just bring salt, pepper, and hot sauce!

<review>I've been here a lot, but I've always had the broken rice dish.  I brought my parents here while they were visiting to get their take on it.  \n\nThe broken rice dishes are all great.  The menu might look giant, but all the dishes are just slight variations of each other.  If you had broken rice with about 11 different things you can get on it... just imagine the different variations of menu items you can write.  \n\nMy dad had the bi suon ta hu ky which is shredded pork, pork chop, and a tofu skin wrap filled with shrimp.  He really liked it and said it reminded him of something that he would get in northern cali.\n\nMy mom and I ordered dishes that are really hard to find at other restaurants.  She had these little rice vermicelli pattie noodles with some pork and a fish sauce topping.  She said the vermicelli was a little dry, but the pork was really good.\n\nI had the banh canh which is an udon like noodle in a  a light pork broth.  The broth was really good.  I think it's better than the one next door (unphogettable).  If you look at the broth, it's crystal clear which is something that's hard to do.  \n\nPricing is really fair with around 7.99 a dish that would have anyone walking away really full.\n\nI give it only 4 stars, because the tea situation really weirds me out.  They pour tea in a tall glass that would be used for water.  The glass was really hot, and it cooled down really quickly.  My mom even asked if they had a pot of tea, and they said no.  She said a pot of tea would stay warm longer and taste a lot better.\n\nOverall I would definitely come here and eat anytime while I'm grocery shopping.  I've actually made my way to this place after a long night of drinking to cure the blues.

<review>"""I have to give props to Chef Beau McMillan for doing \fusion\""""  right. \""""Fusion\"""" is a dime a dozen nowadays, and only a few can do it well. For dinner, I highly suggest the salmon with the udon noodles, if it is available (menu changes depending on what's in season). And for dessert, please try the banana concoction. It is just divine! So, yes, I'm a big fan of Chef Beau (he is not pretentious and seems fun). Afterall, he did beat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef."""""""

<review>This is easily my favorite cafe in all of Tempe - and perhaps the Valley - for lunch and baked goods.  The atmosphere is charming and understated from the way you order to the friendly service you wouldn't expect from a counter service kind of place.\n\nI'm always torn on whether to order the croque monseiur or the warm open faced steak sandwich.  Both of the sandwiches are superbly prepared and presented.  You can't go wrong with either.  I always opt for the dijon potato side salad garnished with mustard seed.\n\nThe warm open faced steak sandwich is tastefully done with tender grilled ribeye with a cabernet butter and sauteed mushrooms and bleu cheese.  Rich, sinful and bad but in a good way, kind of like sex with an old ex.  Similarly the croque monseiur has me hooked, but their use of de-seeded jalapenos adds a distinctive Arizona touch that I just love.\n\nWhile waiting for my lunch I can never resist their outstanding macarons (I prefer the chocolate, but both are delicious), cakes and cookies (go for the chocolate truffle) displayed so innocently behind the glass case where you order.\n\nSince I am friends with someone who works here, she doesn't serve us (company policy), so service is usually by the manager, and once we even got the chef, which was a nice surprise because I was able to ask her details on the sandwiches.\n\nAnd finally, because they use organic and locally grown ingredients you can leave feeling like not-so much of an asshat.

<review>After hitting up Club Cream.. We walked over to this joint.... never really been around Scottsdale... especially not for the club scene... but that quickly changed over the weekend \n\nyou could hear the music blasting from across the street... people pouring out of the doors and the front patio... looked like a great time... \n\nand No Cover!! :) we were happy to try it out.... \n\nit reminded me of a pub... it was really crowded with people so i couldnt really tell what was on the walls or anything like that... but the bar was wooden and there was alot of seating :) that made me happy :)\n\ni didn't drink so I'm not sure if it was cheap or not... \n\nbut they played great music non stop... and there were really chill down to earth people hanging out... with is hard to come by out in Scottsdale.... so it was fun... \n\ni even got to see a grown man grind on the stripper pole in the back by the DJ stand... haha WOW... yea wow explains it all... he was doing the robot at one time to... i should have told him to go over to Club Cream lol.... \n\nthe bathroom was decent... but could have been cleaner... (paper towels were the decor') \n\nit was a fun time... i would like to go back in the future :)

<review>A great all-around stadium to watch the game.  With the exception of a few spaces on the lawn, there are no bad seats in the house, and the stadium still has a great classic baseball look to it.\n\nWe always opt for the lawn seats.  Let's be honest, most people that sit in the lawn of this stadium never watch more than 5 pitches.  It is a people-watching, party scene.  If you are lucky enough to get there a bit earlier, get a good spot on the lawn, and you can enjoy the best of both - baseball  and  people.\n\nWhat I really love about this park is the food / beer.  How can you not enjoy a San Fran game without a classic San Fran Beer - Anchor Steam and Garlic Fries from Gordon Biersch.  Minus the heat, you feel like you are right in the bay area.  Plus, you can smell the fries cooking 3 sections over.\n\nIf you are an autograph junkie, they usually have a good (but repetitive) line up of old stars behind 3rd base signing autographs.\n\nParking is limited directly around the park, but you can usually snake a spot in a neighborhood or park in Old Town and take the trolley or walk.\n\nA HUGE knock on this park - ticket prices.  Just about everywhere else in AZ you can get a lawn seat for a spring training game around $8.  At the Scottsdale Stadium - $19.25!  They also do flex-pricing here, which means if a popular team (Dodgers / Cubs) are there the ticket prices will go up.\n\nIf you are new to AZ, and want to see a game, you can't go wrong here.  Plus, afterward, most people spill right into old town to keep the party going!\n\n* This spring training, I took on an aggressive goal.  Go to all 10 Spring Training Parks  and  see all 15 teams in one spring training season, and do it all on the weekends (FRI-SUN).  This review is a part of 10 total reviews.

<review>We had gotten a gift card for the FOX restaurants. We had about 6 restaurants from which to choose. I decided on the North - Glendale. We made reservations for 6:45 and arrived about 10 min early. They were not busy yet and we were seated at that time. Our waiter was Matthew a very energetic and helpful person. He told us about the special and answered the questions we had for entr\u00e9es we were considering. My wife decided on the Margherita Pizza and me on the Ahi Tuna. Their pizza is on a very thin crust which is how we prefer it. The Ahi was ordered rare. When our order arrived the waiter said he thought the Ahi may be a little more cooked than I had ordered and offered to take it back if I wanted one less cooked. It was cooked more than I would have liked but I told him it was fine. It was a very nice piece of meat. We had great service. Matthew was very attentive but not overly attentive. All our needs were met and we will definitely go back. The staff is a great group of people. Oh the pizza was very good and more than most would eat at one setting.

<review>Solid, solid, solid Chinese! Period. If you are looking for authentic or close to--low and behold, the Great Wall! \n\nIf you don't believe me, come here on the Weekends between 10am and 12pm.  The sheer number of folks trying to find seats and the hustling and bustling from the staff would easily overwhelm your craving thoughts!\n\nDim Sum is the alternative to the usual brunch of waffles and hash browns.  Why have a sausage link when you can suck on chicken feet? Don't worry, not everything is that exotic.  Most items they carry are very feasible and safe.\n\nDinner is also another epic adventure in itself! The menu is very extensive and could take you a couple of hours to finally decide on something.  Or you can make it easier for your party by asking for the family menu that contains a set of items they recommend.  This route is typically cheaper and feed more if you have a large group.  If you are adventurous, ask for the family menu that is Chinese! Can't read, server can help translate.\n\nSeafood is always fresh as they have live tanks in the restaurant.  Service is usually quick.  It always amazes me how fast I get my food sometimes!\n\nI used to come here a lot for wedding receptions and other festivities.  Do not be surprised if you arrive and half the dining space is occupied.\n\nI would come here over those buffets any day of the week.  I would recommend dining with a large group to not only help with the cost but be able to chow on more dishes.

<review>I tried to hit this place with Julie P. on opening day, but traffic was backed up from the entrance all the way to 29th Ave, along Indian School Rd. We retreated to another supermercado, our dreams of tacking a whack at the opening day pi\u00f1ata completely dashed.\n\nFortunately, Helen Y. and i were combing the area before going to Tim Finnegans, so we checked it out. The layout is almost identical to the Ranch Market on 16th st. and Roosevelt, with the same amazing produce and aguas frescas. The seafood bar isn't as snazzy, and I'm not sure they have grab 'n'  go containers of salsa -- you can buy it by the pound at the salsa bar, which would take an extra 30 seconds or so. \n\nWhat's cool about this location (besides being a ten minute drive from the Melrose District), is that the Costco Business Center shares the parking lot, and they sell dirt-cheap restaurant supplies. A trip to both places could outfit a barren fridge and kitchen for about 18 bucks. Since I plan to cook five nights a week until things turn around, 33rd Ave. and Indian School is recession-busting headquarters.

<review>"""My family and I have been eating at Spinatos for over 20 years.  We've followed them all over town, to each location.  I would say with 100% certainty that this is the best pizza ever.  We love the family who owns and runs the restaurants.  They are great people.\n\nWe were excited to see the new Ahwatukee location open.  We were loyal to the Tempe location, but this new one is closer.  I love what they did with the old Chili's.  It is beautiful!  They really did a great job. \n\nWhile my review of 5 stars is for the Company as a whole, I have to say that this new location is not my favorite and I probably won't return. \n\nThe food is amazing, that is not a problem.  I could eat Spinatos pizza and food everyday for the rest of my life.\n\nBut this location lacks the family feel that I'm used to.  On both occasions that I've gone here, I've received poor service.  The wait times for a table are grossly underestimated.  I was told 30 minutes (at an off peak time), and it was 65 minutes later that I got a table.  Our waters were never refilled and we didn't see our server until we flagged her down to get our check.  \n\nWhile this location is beautiful and I'm so happy for the family, I won't be back there.  I'll keep going to the \hole in the wall\"""" Smith location in Tempe where I'll actually see some of the Family, and get the amazing food and service that I've grown to love over the last many years.  \n\nI"""""""

<review>If you want pretty decent Chicago style pizza, then you need to come here. The ambiance is casual and the decor kind of old school which I like. The wine we ordered was named after someone very near and dear to my heart so of course we ordered it and it was middle of the road. Nothing terrible but nothing special. Then we started with the wings. The flavor was delicious but the execution seemed like they were boiled or something. Too soft for the way wings should be. No big though, just took them home. Then pizza was yummy! I was truly impressed with the crust! It was cooked to the ideal crispness and softness that a deep dish should be. The flavor profile was fantastic! I worked in a kitchen making pizza for a while so I know what is good. The cheese was stringy and hot like it should be and there were plenty of thinky sliced pepperoni just the way I like it. I'm not so sure the staff cares as much as the cooks but I enjoyed my time there.

<review>This is a hidden jem that is not to be missed.\n\nWe were greeted quickly and with a smile when we walked through the door from a young lady in the bar.  Another lady greeted us and took us to our table.  A gentleman brought us hot tea and cold water to our table right away, and then we were greeted by our waitress Rose.  Good team work going on at this place.  \n\nI have never been to a nice Chinese place before.  This was a really nice one and I was super excited to see how the food would taste.  While enjoying my hot tea (BEST TEA EVER!  it was PERFECT), I glanced over the menu.  The prices are very decent and they have many different dishes to choose from.  \n\nWe started with an order of fried wantons.  These were light, airy, slightly crispy, delicate and filled with a little bit of cream cheese.  They came with sweet and sour sauce, which was the best sweet and sour sauce I've ever had.  Nice bright red orange color, sweet and tangy and not thick or to thin, just right.  Very good start to a grand meal that I had no idea was about to come.\n\nRose moved our fried wantons' plate out of the way and put two large plates in front of us.  She then started bringing out our food.  We had sweet and sour pork, pan fried noodles, fried rice, and sesame chicken.  Sesame chicken was at least two large oh so TENDER chicken breasts crisped to perfection in thick dark onion sauce that I soaked my rice and noodles in.  Pan fried noodles were lightly oiled and tasted like they were fried in a wok, very tasty.  The fried rice was fresh, soft and fluffy.  The sweet and sour pork was smothered (NOT soggy) in their yummy sweet and sour sauce.  It included large chunks of pineapples, green bell peppers and onions.\n\nEvery portion was enough for two to three people to share or even save for the next day (see photos), BUT it is going to be so hard from stopping yourself enjoying your hot fresh food in such a romantic dark setting (music overhead was a love song station).  \n\nWe had so much to pack up, Rose came by and put it all up for us in boxes.  She was awesome, very sweet, and always came by to check on us to see how we were doing.  \n\nFor everything we got -not- including tip was ONLY $34.  Forget the buffets, this is the place to go.\n\nI highly recommend this place for large groups, couples, events, and anyone else who loves Chinese Food.  It's the BEST I EVER HAD!

<review>Went here only once, but it left a fairly strong impression.  I'd recently discovered Yelp and found myself taking notes through the whole thing about things I wanted to say - then I threw that away and decided to go w/ my gut.  I mention that, because it feel like that's what this place is like - someone originally had this list of the detailed things that needed to be included, then they just sort of scraped that and did something in between.  It wants to be upscale (to pay the rent and bring in the chicks) but in the end it's a bar with tons of beer and upscale bar food.  When it comes to food (this is where the list comes in) they have everything - burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, seafood, chicken fried chicken, mac  and  cheese, rice bowl, steaks, ribs and a bevy of desert options.  I mean - really?  What made you decide you needed to tackle a menu that big?  Trying to compete w/ Cheesecake factory?  Pricing is about the same as well - but serving sizes are not. These are smaller.\n\nI'll be honest - the food was pretty good.  Our server was particularly helpful in helping the guys plow their way through the beer lists.  They didn't sing for his birthday (BIG plus!) but they totally respected that it was a special occasion dinner.  As the night went on, my brother's only complaint was that for a place that specialized in beer, the bathroom shouldn't have been so far away from where folks sit - located by the front door.  I thought that was a noble observation, even if he was slurring a bit as he mentioned it...

<review>Touch of Thai is probably the best I've found so far in the Valley.  Satay is the ultimate gauge of a Thai restaurant IMHO, if your satay sucks you've just tarnished my opinion of your entire establishment.  Is it fair?  Maybe so, maybe not but I got my standards!!\nTheirs is pretty good, their noodle dishes (pad see u, pad kee mau, etc,) are also good choices.  I am a big fan of spicy food and their menu does not disappoint in that regard when I specify that I like it HOT!!!\nHave fun!  And a Singha!

<review>This afternoon I decided to have lunch @ Stacy's. It was recommended by a friend and since they just opened a 2nd location across the street from where I reside I figured I had no excuse, plus I had just watched a Travel Channel special on the Best BBQ Spots across the country, so I was definitely in the mood.\nI ordered their Lunch Special #1, choice of sandwich, (I chose the Beef Brisket), choice of side (Sweet Fries) and a fountain drink for about $9. It was very tasty, their bbq sauce is unlike anything I have ever tasted, (sweet and smoky) I knew as soon as I finished my first bite that it was a flavor that I would find myself craving in the future. The sweet fries were also very good. \nMy only knock on the food was the bun that the sandwich was served on, basically a regular sesame seed hamburger bun, It cheapened the sandwich in my opinion, which is a shame because it was soooo good. I'll definitely be back for 2nds and 3rds but would love to get my sandwich on a higher quality bun. Good Luck w/ the new location!!
</review>
<review>I read all the reviews are they are not good, so why do I like this place? It's old fashioned, the service was great - just nice and polite. It takes a bit longer to get your food (it's a good thing). Open kitchen. The burger was super messy in a yummy way. The meat was not a perfect flat circle it actually seemed like real beef. I drank a full sugar cherry coke and it was worth every calorie. I got the skinny fries, not because I thought they had less calories but I like skinny stick fries that are crispy and they were. \nI got a medium fatburger with cheese  and  grilled onions, medium skinny fries, drink, the kid got: small fatburger with cheese, fat fries and milk shake. It came to a little over $20. \nThe only thing that would improve is beer. The only negative is a bit too salty but that might be why it was so good too.

<review>"""I love to sit and spin! Here, on top on the Hyatt, you can do JUST THAT... and eat while your spinning.  Its a multi-tasker's dream!!!!\n\nThis place is pretty amazing.  I have only been here for evening dinners and drinks, but I can tell you that it is a great venue for a special occasion.  I took my lovely lady here for a birthday and for an anniversary, so I pretty much played this out. However, you can still go!!!\n\nIf you are a fan of Prime Rib, you have GOT to try the Compass Room's version.  It is cooked in a Merlot which makes it taste uber-fancy and your significant other will want to strip you down right there and thank you properly. For desert, try the Tiramasu.  It has thick chocolate walls printed with the signature 'Compass Room' and will put everyone in the mood for a party!\n\nThe price is pretty high.  Like Amy said, about $80 per head. But definitely worth it.\n\nFor this, I believe the Compass Room's logo should be \Sit, Spin, Go Home and Get Some\""""\n\nDo it. Do it."""""""

<review>I had never heard much about Eddie's House so I was skeptical when I was invited to dinner. I was in for a lovely surprise. \n\nMy table started out with the Toasted Horseradish-Mashed Potato Stuffed Shrimp and the Grilled Honey-Spiced Chicken Lollipops. While the lollipops were a hit, the stuffed shrimp had a bit too much horseradish. The best part of the shrimp was the funny faces that ensued after the horseradish kicked in. The bread was also good, accompanied by a pesto and blue cheese butter.\n\nBetween the five of us we ordered the Tuna and Halibut, Chilean Chilean Sea Bass, and Swordfish. While all of the meals were delicious, the Sea Bass really stood out.\n\nFinally, for dessert we ordered the Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e and a Chocolate Chip cookie dough Tiramisu . The Tiramisu was delicious and unique!\n\nWe were also impressed by the service. Not only was our waitress patient and helpful, but Eddie's wife came over to check on us twice. She was really nice and wanted to make sure everything was to our liking - great service!\n\nI am already looking forward to returning to Eddie's House.

<review>"""While I'm reviewing pho's, I'll give my review on Cyclo. This is where I'd take that cute Vietnamese babe I met last week. It has great atmosphere and the food is awesome. I ate here about a week ago and had their pho bowl and it was one of the best I have tried in the valley, I really loved it. The girl who seated us was really nice and gave an enjoyable contribution to the dining experience. Yes this place cost almost twice what I pay across town but worth it with the right company. My brother and I ate here and we both agreed we would probably not eat here together much but we will both be eating here again. AKA we thought this was alot better place to take a girl or a business associate than our fav pho in the area to have lunch together.  Cyclo has a more upscale atmosphere than the average pho and we both thought the food is above average.\nI don't agree with another reviewers post that the portions here are small. I had one appetizer with a pho bowl and left full.  I'm 6'3\ 230 and like to eat ALOT and my brother who is shorter but heavier than me was complaining he ate too much after we left. One of the best phos in the east valley!"""""""

<review>I have just experience food heaven and a food coma all in one! I have always wanted to try this place because I have heard such good things. Their sunset menu before a show at the Gammage Theater was the perfect excuse. Honestly it was such a good deal for so much food and such tasty options. I went with my sister and we each tried something different off the menu and shared. For starters we got the edamame hummus and garden salad. The wonton chips with the hummus were so good and the salad was so light and refreshing. \n\nFor the second course I got the vegetable tempura and popcorn shrimp. Both of which were good, but I would go with the shrimp. The vegetable tempura was good but a bit heavy before the final course. \n\nI got the salmon as my main course and my sister got the filet. The salmon was perfectly cooked, but I didn't need the rice and the sauce was slightly too sweet for me. The filet was so good with a great teriyaki sweet sauce and perfectly smooth mashed potatoes. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful in our selections and the ambiance was nice. Not super crowded but we had an early reservation. I want to go back and try the rest of the menu.

<review>"""I was never excited about bagels before in my life until Big City.  Now I look forward to sneaking over there a few times a week for one of their freshly made delicacies.  BCB is family owned and family run and the kids are just wonderful, hard working people.  \n\nI know that they have specials after two for a dozen bagels and they look like they wonderful sandwiches.  All that I know thus far is that the quality of their bagels is second to none.  They are larger than the competitors and prepared better.  The coffee is great, and is self serve.  The store is clean and has about 5 or 6 tables outside so you may enjoy your day or take your dog along for a bite.\n\nI never thought I'd be raving about something as \blah\"""" as a bagel.  But BCB is so much more than that.  Enjoy!"""""""

<review>Considering the price and city, this hotel totally deserves 5 stars for it's interesting styling and great design choices. The exterior of the hotel rooms has a retro feeling, while the interiors are furnished with modern furniture and decorations. The extra large tub (cornered by 2 frosted glass walls) even has a mood light shining down on it. You probably won't find another hotel this chic in all of Arizona.\n\nIf I ever come back to the Phoenix area again, I will be sure to book at this hotel again. It gets my highest recommendation.\n\nPrice Tip: Smartphone users should use the HotelTonight App, which will run last minute deals for this hotel.

<review>I stumbled upon this restaurant when performing a Yelp search for Ceviche in Mesa the other day.\n\nI was a little skeptical due to some of the low ratings, but we decided to enter the humble looking venue, in the primitive looking strip mall.\n\nWe were immediately greeted and seated by a lovely hostess / server. She was extremely attentive and informative, as we were not familiar with Pupusas or much of the other Salvadorian Cuisine.\n\nWe ordered and shared the Shrimp Ceviche, which was garnished with fresh Avocado and Cucumbers. The freshly fried tortilla chips were very tasty, and the ceviche was a little more on the sweet side vs. the typical intense lime flavor. It was very fresh tasting, and we both really enjoyed it.\n\nWe were given a lesson in what Pupusas are, and asked our lovely waitress to pick three of her favorite choices and send them out. She chose Carne Asada, Chicharon with beans, and the last one was not quite identified, but was very tasty.\n\nBefore bringing out the Pupusas, she dropped off a small bowl of a red sauce, and a bowl of spicy cabbage, which were meant to be used as toppings for the Pupusas.\n\nWe both thought that the Pupusas were very simple, yet tasty. The spicy cabbage and red sauce as toppings really added flavor to the Pupusas.\n\nWe were impressed with what we perceived to be authentic Salvadorian Cuisine, so we ordered one last dish. \n\nWe had to try the fried Plantains, served with a black bean sauce, and Crema. The plantains were fried to perfection with nice caramelization. The black bean sauce was interesting, and the cream was a little on the salty side, rather than sweet as I would have expected. It is small details such as these which led us to believe that the food was authentic.\n\nDon't let the other reviews mislead you if you are looking for a fresh, authentic experience. \n\nIf you want a fancy location with beer and wine, then forget about it. This place is all about giving an authentic, down to earth, culinary experience to those who seek quality without the distraction of interior design.  :)

<review>Wondering where to go to dinner tonight, we followed our senses and the cyber sensations coming from the deli's e-mail blast of tonight's menu. We made the long drive to Queen Creek from NE Mesa (on a week night!) and were rewarded handsomely with the usual amazing fare. My wife had the Panko Crusted Pork Schnitzel w/ Lemon Butter Sauce and I had the Slow Roasted Chicken Breast w/ Romesco Sauce.  As usual, the meats were a cut well above and the sides (Pearl Couscous w/ Roasted Tomatoes in my case) were inventive and came in generous portions (too bad I'm on a low carb diet!).  Don't let the butcher paper tablecloths and casual attitude fool you. the deli serves serious food! Blake and his staff know how to please!  Make the drive one time and you'll end up investing in a hybrid so you can afford to come back again and again and again.

<review>"""Best Feature: Bento\n\nFujiya is noticeably different from most Japanese establishments in Arizona in that it's owned and run completely by Japanese.  As such, they run the place like a real \conbini\"""" in Japan.  As you enter, all of the workers great you with an \""""Irraishaimase\"""" and you can peruse the isles filled with certain things you can't find in the Japanese section of LeeLee (Like Gabunomi and Qoo).\n\nThe place reminds me of the Nijiya chain in CA.  The Bentos are pretty much the best in the area.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood."""""""

<review>I can't say much about this place because I do the same damned thing every time.  Pull up to the drive through window, smile at the nice lady, order a teriyaki combo or two and some rolls, and peel out with my food in two minutes or less.\n\nI can't imagine it's the toughest thing in the world to make consistently good teriyaki, but I'll tell you what, those people are friendly every damned time I roll through.  And the food is always still hot and delicious when I plop down on my sofa to dig in.  Oh, and the salad dressing for the combo salad is yum.  God, I think this place might have been around back when I was in high school.  Way to keep it rolling!  Five stars, baby!

<review>"""As an East Coast 1st generation Italian, I was very excited to see a more casual version of Aiello's open very close to me, and on my way home from work no less.  I can tell this place will be trouble for my waistline.\n\nSalumeria means a store that sells cold cuts, meats, etc.  Aiello's does that and more.  I've only had a sampling of their food so far and just based on the Sfogliatelle in the dessert case, I'm in love.\n\nCaprese Paninni - absolutely delightful focaccia bread, fresh mozzarella, basil that smelled and tasted like it had just been picked and juicy tomatoes.  Divine.\n\nAnitpasto Salad - real Italian meats and cheeses, not those weird little sliced bundles of rolled up American meats and cheeses like you find at other places.  This salad was peppered with whole slices of imported Italian meats and a beautiful blend of greens and artichoke hearts.\n\nArancini - OK, I love these!  My Mom used to make them occasionally so I was thrilled to find them on their menu.  It's delicious!  A huge stuffed ball of rice in tomato sauce.  Way too big for me to finish so I am enjoying it for breakfast as I type this.\n\nNow, to the item that will most get me in trouble!\nSfogliatelle - In Italian this word means \many leaves\"""" and that is what this pastry looks like. Some call it Lobster Tails..I call it by it's traditional name.  You have an option of two different fillings.  One is similar to cannolli filling...YUM.....the other is a sweet ricotta with citron...DOUBLE  YUM....  At almost 500 calories a pop, I'll really have to restrain myself or hit bootcamp twice a day!  Honestly haven't had Sfogliatelle this good since I left the East Coast.\n\nAiello's Salumeria, I will be back and am very much looking forward to it.  There's nothin' better than a little midweek Italian foodgasm!"""""""

<review>The place is beautifully decorated and the food was AMAZING. I would totally go back for more of their delicious nachos. Loved the fresh salsa and the presentation was gorgeous. Will definitely leave room to try dessert next time. \n\nThe server, Daniel? was wonderful! He did a great job.\n\nI would love to give them 5 stars but there are some kinks they have to work out - what new business doesn't? \n\nThey would hands down have 5 or more stars if they had:\n\n* A sign - people need to know if they are in the right place.\n* Clear hours online and on the door and adhere to them. Every minute counts when it is insanely hot and people are on very limited lunch breaks.\n* Open/closed sign. \n* Cross-trained staff so even if the server is not there yet people can be served.\n* Decreased wait time between being seated and receiving water/menus.\n* A bell or something at the door so they hear customers coming.

<review>Super friendly, great service, came in just before they stop serving Dim Sum at 3:00PM on a Saturday and chef was willing to make some for us on short notice.  \n\nA picture menu and ordering of a list like a sushi menu instead of having a cart roll out to you was neat.  And the picture menu really helped out my linner partner.  So we were able to get all the dishes we wanted delivered out to our table in one go which I found convenient.  \n\nThe Dim Sum was well executed, not greasy, and the price is right.   I'd rate it about the same level as House of Sifu in Chandler.   But bellow Great Wall or Golden Buda the the other 3 major Dim Sim places in the valley.

<review>Los Olivos Norte is the North Scottsdale outpost of the original, located in Old Town.  This is your basic, everyday (American) Mexican food place.  Fajitas, combination platters, chips  and  salsa, etc. etc.  While Los Olivos Norte is not going to blow your socks off, it is good, typical Mexican food.  I give it four stars because I am a Mexican food addict.  If you do a good job (and they do), I'm going to be a fan.\n\nThe service here is QUICK.  Chips and salsa (plus a free bean dip!) came out immediately.  They were quick to take our order and the food was out, fresh and hot, about 10 minutes later.  Again, the food isn't going to change your life, but it is tasty and does the job.

<review>I have been here when it was still a buffet when they first opened. I wasn't too thrilled as it was like any other buffet. The only cool thing I thought was the ice cream selection. \n\nWell that was then this is now...\n\nOn a very hungry late evening a fellow yelper Clifford and I were gonna meet up for some Chinese food. We were headed to our favorite spot on the east side. When I got there it was 5 min from closing and Clifford was still 15 min away. After discussing some options I made it down to Dobson and Warner to find Phoenix Palace open till 10. After giving Clifford a ring we met up there and gave it a shot. \n\nUpon entering I noticed that the place was empty, but not common on a monday night and with all the other places in the area closing early the complex is usually dead by 9. The place no longer having any buffet tables and many of the awful decor gone it could be promising. \n\nSeeing that their menu had some of my favorite dishes I thought I give it a shot. So some Spicy Salt and Pepper Pork Chop, Salted Fish Fried Rice and Beef Stew Hotpot. \n\nWow! Were we surprised with the food, especially this late at night. The pork chops were well seasoned to how they should be and very crispy on outside and juicy on the inside. The beef stew was wonderful, the meat was well cooked and the large pieces of the green onion was a great touch of flavor. The salted fish fried rice was not so great, it was very under seasoned and the portions for the fish and chicken were not a large as some places are with this dish. \n\nOn my second visit I tried a different fried rice dish and same thing very under seasoned. It seems like that the chef has very strong dishes and some other dishes are not so strong. I have yet to try the dim sum but i'm sure this is going to be very good as well.
</review>
<review>Wait...they have food here? You mean people don't just come to drink martinis and hit on each other?  \nHmmm. I had no idea!  Okay maybe I did, but if you've ever been in the bar area, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Wall to wall people- almost uncomfortably so- and they all look like they've just stepped out of a salon or Gucci. Come 5pm, Sapporo turns into a big, well-dressed meat market. \nBut if you actually do make it to the dining area or a cooking table, the food is fantastic. The prices are high, so don't expect to leave without a big bill, but Sapporo is always a good time and definitely the place to see and be seen pretty much any night of the week.

<review>What an awesome restaurant concept! Every dish is labeled with major allergens and everything is healthy  and  delicious.\n\nThe cocktails tantalize your tastebuds and the main courses were delicious! The skinny baked sweet potato fries were the best I've had.\n\nMy main course was the Herb Crusted Barramundi. It was amazing!  I had never had this fish, but it was mild and moist and so yummy! Everything tasted so fresh.\n\nIf you looking for a healthy restaurant, you have to give Nourish a try!

<review>Best body piercing shop I have EVER been to.  It was a little busy when I walked in but the guy at the counter, Chris,  greeted me right away and asked what I wanted to get done. I told him and he got all the paperwork started and showed me which jewelry I could choose from for each piercing (nostril and helix). Once I picked them out I still had to wait a little while but he kept a conversation going with everyone so that we were occupied.\n\nThe piercer I got was Dana and he was awesome. He's really funny and down to earth which took away any nervousness I had. He showed me a couple different options as far as placement for each of the piercings and didn't waste any time getting to it which I like. He was very quick actually doing the piercings and kept me talking the whole time so that I wasn't thinking about the fact that he was sticking needles into me.  After both piercings were done he made sure I was actually okay and wasn't just saying that to try and look tough.\n\nHe walked me out to pay and made sure I understood the care instructions and to feel free to stop by or call if I had any questions.  Chris emphasized that again while he was taking my payment and gave me Dana's card with their contact information and also the sizing of the jewelry I got. I left trying to think of what else I want to get pierced just because I had such a great experience there. I will definately be going back soon!

<review>Dear Chick Fil A \nThank you for providing a bountiful lunch today. \nI heart dipping my waffle fries in your honey. \nYour 3 piece chicken strip meal can **almost** do no wrong. While I appreciate your use of real chicken, I do not really appreciate the greasy chicken glaze you leave on my fingers when I feast upon you. \nI appreciate you for having diet Dr. Pepper and bunny turd ice! \nAlso, though I did not get the cole slaw today, it must be acknowledged! I am picky about my slaw, and yours is damn tasty! \nSo thank you chick fil a! You are minutes away from my work and saved me from starving at my desk today!

<review>Our family has been huge Filiberto's fans for many years, most particularly this location.\n\nNo matter how busy this location is, the staff really hops to get all orders prepared and served as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality. This evening's stop at Filiberto's proved my point yet again.\n\nWith long lines both at the walk-up window and drive-thru, the food was prepared quickly and promptly served to the customers all by staff members who were still smiling and very polite. \n\nThis location is very convenient and easy to enter and exit. Located on the north side of Main Street, east of Stapley Drive.\n\nEnjoy!

<review>"""I was turned on to this Tearoom by my good friend Cindy.   The place is small and very darling.  You walk in and immediately are greeted by the owner of one of three other women who work there faithfully.  The decor is very Victorian.  There is a wide variety of beautiful China tea cups, pots and teas for sale as well as many other items to compliment a formal tea at your home.\n\nWhen you enter and are seated, you will find beautifully laid tables.  The table is laid out for a formal tea.   They offer everything from fresh, out of the oven scones to the traditional tiered plate offerings of finger sandwiches, cheese and fruit.  If you are wanting something more substantial, I would recommend their bread pudding (to die for!) or their beautiful Waldorf salad.  The food is very fresh, prepared well, and presented well.   The selections of tea are vast and they also offer a tea of the day just to keep the variety going.\n\nWhile there, you are offered to \dress up\"""" if you so desire.  A darling array of Boas and Hats are offered to guests to use while dinning.  They are great for pictures and make a special event all the more festive.\n\nBesides the ambiance, the food is always of excellent quality.  Fresh, and the best of everything is used.  Please save room for dessert!  You won't want to miss their traditional English offerings.\n\nMy only complaint with the place is that the tables, chairs, and room are small.  There isn't much room to move, and the tables are packed together pretty tight.  If you are any bigger than 5'2\"""" and 100 lbs, you will be uncomfortable in their chairs.  Very small and not good on the back.  If you are wanting a darling experience with a Tea Room, with excellent food, you won't be disappointed.\n\nDuring the peak season you will want to make reservations.  With a small amount of tables, they fill up fast and are a favorite in the Carefree area.  Enjoy!"""""""

<review>I used to come here strictly for the pizookie... It's the most delicious dessert and I can never find the strength to pass it up.\n\nThen I came to realize that their food is equally as amazing as the pizookie.  I don't eat wings, but their sauce is so good, I'd love to buy a bottle of that stuff.  I've been ordering their Veggie Wedgie sandwich or the barbecue pizza when I'm with my cousin.. She adds all kinds of toppings to the pizza and I would recommend ordering a pizza w/ bbq sauce and then whatever else appeals to you.. (Thin crust of course, it's the best PLUS their thick crust usually takes a little less than an hour to make)  I guarantee you'll love it!

<review>I was recently blessed with a little getaway that included a stay at Firesky Resort  and  Spa.  I have had my fair share of hotel experiences, and I have to say I was so pleasantly surprised by this venue.\n\nThe staff at the front desk and at the restaurant were very nice and helpful.  The cleaning crew did a great job tidying up the room and replacing all the amenities (shampoo, conditioner, and lotion from Aveda!).\n\nThe room was beautiful - great decor, comfy bed, nice flat screen tv, plenty of vanity space, super high water pressure in the shower, and complimentary cheetah-patterned robes for the duration of the stay.\n\nThe pool area is amazing!  Small waterfalls, one pool included a beach area complete with sand, perfect temperature for all hours of the day, and plenty of chairs and towels to accommodate any guests.\n\nI have to admit I was a little sad leaving the hotel.  I wish I could have stayed a little longer.  I definitely want to return, and next time I will take advantage of the spa services, and spend more time at the pool.

<review>"""This place is just amazing! I first found myself here on a late night seriously craving Pho  and  a buzz,  and  my oh my, they do it right! I have since become a regular... \n\nThe staff is entertaining  and  fun, the drinks are awesome, the food is fun  and  delicious! Great place for a date, to hang out, to have get to-gethers, to come alone  and  end up w/ good conversation  and  new friends  and  a satisfied tummy. \n\nWide variety of spring rolls  and  appetizers. The main thing, PHO, is to swoon over. I've had the beef, the chicken  and  the vegan, all 3 are satisfying. Ask for the Grandma Sauce, but be warned, be sparing in adding this to your Pho.\n\nThe Firecracker Shimp is a personal favorite as well. \n\nSafe place for Vegans  and  meat-heads alike! \n\nI've seen some reviews where others say they feel RP is too expensive  and  you can get good Pho much cheaper at the other Vietnamese places... true, however, this is \Modern Vietnamese\"""" ... Great food, Great place to hang out for a few hours, Great environment!"""""""

<review>From the ambiance, to the staff, to the wine list, this place has got it figured out.  I LOVE wine, but I usually feel like I'm being tested when I go into wine bars.  This place is so unpretentious, it's a breath of fresh air.  If you don't know exactly what to ask for, the staff will ask you about what you've liked in the past, what flavor profiles you prefer, and a ton of other questions to narrow down exactly what you'll like.  3 times out of 3 they've nailed it on the head!\nThey just recently added a happy hour menu and expanded their food menu as well...you have to try the smoked salmon bruschetta best I've had in the valley (even beats out postino's smoked salmon!)\nTo top it off, this place even offers wine 101 classes, grape varietal classes, and even a book club!  \nI think you get it by now: This place rules.

<review>The hubs and I attended the musical Hair at Gammage this past Tuesday (thanks Yelp!). We came straight from work and were in need of some dinner. \n\nThis Chipotle happens to be right across the street. Awesometown. \n\nThe place was slam packed. There wasn't one free seat inside or out. So we got in line anyway hoping for a place to sit. I told the hubs what I wanted in the event that I saw a table free up so I could swoop in on it. And swoop I did! \n\nEverything was good, as always. It was my first time going to this one, and most likely wont go back considering how ridiculously busy it was, I don't like to have to street fight people for a place to eat my dinner.

<review>Now don't let my profile picture fool you, I am not, in the traditional sense, a Mexican. Shocking, I know. But, I do know my Mexican food, and Los Favoritos is awesome! Wonderful in fact. Delicious, cheap, clean and delicious.\n\n  This morning I got a bacon breakfast burrito with beans inside, and if you don't know, their breakfast burritos are their bread and butter, the money maker, and they never disappoint. The only problem you may ever have is the bacon being a little salty, and even then the always incredible hot sauce (or salsa, whatever) is there to save the day. The carne asada is very good, seasoned well and almost always very tender, the beans, which are cooked with wonderful, wonderful lard, are always just firm enough, never just a pile of mush, never watery, the chicken is juicy and tender, I just can't say enough about it. The only negative I have is that one of the counter girls is a bit rude, and there is a military service recruitment center right next door, so at times you may be bothered a little by them, but come on, they're serving our country, so it can be forgiven. \n\n  Los Favoritos is the best fast Mexican restaurant that I have discovered so far. Do yourself a favor and give them a visit, at either location (Tempe, Chandler) and tell them Kevin sent you, they'll probably just look at you funny, but why not?

<review>Well, I am starting the year with JUVE AUTO CLINIC doing right by me as usual!!  I needed new brakes front and back on my 2006 Toyota Avalon and of course took my car to JUVE AUTO CLINIC.  Their waiting area is comfortable and when they know you are staying on site for the work to be completed are as accommodating as possible.  What made me really feel like family on this visit is that I had the wrong credit card with me and no problem - I could just call back with the right card when I got home.  That kind of trust to a loyal customer is what generates rave reviews. I was treated with respect with no upset because of a delay in payment.  Always friendly and always courteous and always doing a quality job is why I recommend JUVE AUTO CLINIC to anyone who wants great car repair at a reasonable price.
</review>
<review>This was my second visit here-- my first visit was a few years ago, the last time I was in the Phoenix metro area. There are so many good Mexican places here that knowing which one(s) to visit can be a bit overwhelming, so I rely on the locals to give me tips.\n\nMy sisters have lived in AZ since 1995 and this is one of their fave Mexican places in the West Valley. One thing I must comment on is their salsa. I LOVE THE SALSA AT MANUEL'S. I'm a fiend for good salsas and Manuel's has some of the best around, in my opinion. The food is fresh, decent Mexican, though pretty Americanized by my standards. It's served by friendly people. Gets busy here on weekend nights but definitely worth a visit.
</review>
<review>"""This place deserves 6 stars (seriously)!  \n\nLet me start off by saying I am a HUGE breakfast fan.  Always have been, always will be.  Trust me when I tell you this place deserves 6+ stars from the food alone, but it doesn't stop there!  \n\nMy order:  Red Flannel Hash - if you like beets you have to try this, it is superb.  If you are not a fan of beets (my girlfriend is not and she still loved it) don't worry, there are at least 5 other Hash / Flannel options to choose from and they all sound amazing.  I am coming back every weekend until I try them all and curb my Homemade Corned Beef Hash Fix!!!\n\nGF's order:  Standard Bacon, Egg, Potato combo - Eggs: Cooked to pefection.  Bacon: also cooked to perfection with a very nice smoke to it.  Potatos:  Best I have ever had by far!\n\nBTW, the breads that come with each plate are outstanding (I recommend the olive bread)\n\nAt the end of our breakfast I told my date it was the best I had ever had.  She looked shocked to hear that coming from me (critical breakfast guy)!\n\nI know most people are on here to hear about the food.  But I must say the service was also top notch!  The owner was there working up a sweat as he ran around and when he heard us raving about the food, he brought out a french toast plate called \Bananas Foster\"""".  Once again, Best Damn French Toast I Have Ever Eaten!\n\nSide Note:  this place is a little hard to find the first time you visit, but once you find it you won't ever have trouble finding it again!  (It's in the Scottsdale Civic Center)..."""""""
</review>
<review>So I tried this place today and I was extremely impressed!  I'd had tortas before at a couple of the 'bertos places and while they were okay, they were nothing spectacular.  This place was delicious.  Everything on the menu sounded pretty good, but I ended up with the cubana torta and an alambre taco.  While the tacos was very small, it was very good.  The cubana torta was very good as well.  It was humongous!!!  I couldn't even finish the whole thing and I'm a girl that can eat, trust me, I'm from Texas!!!  It was full of meat and it had lots of avocado on it, which I loved.  Let me just warn you about the avocado looking sauce on the salsa bar.  That stuff is hot.  It's good, but it's very, very hot!  Just looking at it, you would think it wold be a mild sauce since it looks like a creamy avocado, but believe me, this is not for people that can't stand the heat!  It took me aback for a second because I seriously wasn't expecting that type of heat.  I still have a bit of sweat on my brow from it right now as I type this review.  Overall, this place is very good and I can't wait to try the quesadillas because they look pretty darn good themselves.  I also have to say the people that work there are very nice and friendly as well.  Bottom line, this place is excellent and I will definitely go back in the near future!
</review>
<review>I'm shocked by the bad reviews of this place.  You don't go to a place like this to have truffles in your waffles, or creme brulee: it's a BREAKFAST JOINT!  And here's what makes it great:\n\nFood:  Generous portions of tasty food.  The french toast is great, and I love the variety available in their breakfast bowls.  They used to have Cuban salsa, which was a fantastic secret... they ought to bring that back.\n\nPrices: Very reasonable, just bring cash!\n\nStaff:  There's a kid who sings your order to you, and he's awesome.  Everyone else there is friendly, talkative, and happy to throw some more coffee in your cup.\n\nLocation:  Convenient spot, lots of parking, clean tables, fun decor.\n\nSupport your local businesses.
</review>
<review>Linen's Plus, the store that was perfect for me closed.  The staff here has gone out it's way to accommodate me and I appreciate it.  It's a smaller store and they have been out of things I am looking for.  They have always offered to have things sent in for me or at least find it in another store so I can pick it up that day if I need it.\n\n Since I lost the store where I shopped enough that the magnetic strip was worn off my credit card, I have discovered Bed,  Bath,  and Beyond, does carry a wider range of products than I would have known otherwise.  The staff is for the most part, very knowledgeable about their stock.\n\nA special compliment to this store.  Occasionally I shop for a friend using her Amex card.  This store always checks ID's and if your picture isn't on the card, they won't ring you up!  How often does anyone even check let alone stick to the store policy.

<review>This was my first time at Roy's and I have to say I was pretty impressed. Our server was awesome (I believe her name was Kelani) she did a great job of answering all of our questions. I started off with the Hawaiian martini and my fiance had the cucumber cilantro margarita both were very good and unique although kind of pricey. We then had the Asian soft tacos which weren't personally my favorite however John loved them. I ordered the macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and originally when it came out it was super salty I could barely taste anything else at all. I let our waitress know and she was very quick to fix the issue and brought me out a whole new plate and it was amazing, nice, flaky, and moist it had great flavor. I had also ordered a side of the pesto risotto and that was tasty as well. John ordered the white truffle and black pepper sea scallops which were cooked to a perfect medium as he had asked also served with the risotto. Both meals were so good we had to force ourselves to stop eating just to save room for the pineapple upside down cake which was to DIE for. It was made fresh to order and served with homemade coconut ice cream(which I could of ate a whole bowl of alone lol) Overall I had a great experience here and while there was a little mishap with the mahi mahi at first they were quick to fix it and the manager even came by and apologized and took care of our dessert for us.

<review>The Mongolian BBQ craze is a reminent of the 80's that will not wither away.  Every so often I get nostalgic and pursue my hunger cravings.  When this happens, the Genghis Grill is a great solution.  The location is ideal: close enough to the mall for easy access; far away enough to park your car.\n\nThe restaurant itself is clean and the food is fresh.  The staff is courteous and helpful with suggestions.  The actual meal is delicious, but sometimes I get impatient waiting for the fool in front of me to figure out whether he/she needs two or three carrots and spends two minutes figuring it out when all I want to do is eat!\n\nThe meat selection is great: seafood, steak, chicken, etc.  Plenty of veggies and sauces.  The trick is to fit as much uncooked food into the bowl.  That is the part I hate.  I usually end of spilling something, or at the very least try to balance the food so it makes it to the cook in one piece.\n\nI will gladly recommend this place for lunch or dinner.
</review>
<review>"""I hate that places are using \z\"""" at the ends of words instead of \""""s.\""""  Are you doing it to be clever?  Because everyone does it, so it isn't clever.  But clever is not in high supply at any of these newfangled yogurt places--what it really comes down to is whether or not the yogurt is tasty.\n\nAnd it is!  They had more of a selection than Mojo, which I appreciate--they had chocolate/vanilla, strawberry, banana, a couple of non-dairy choices, and so on.  I got strawberry with... cheesecake bits.  And they were so creamy and delightful that each was a little foodgasm all its own.\n\n\nComplaints: Um... where is the trust? The worker did not give us cups to taste--he insisted on serving the yogurt to us himself, even for tasters.  At Golden Spoon this makes sense because we cant reach the machines, but here it's self serve! You trust us to get a ton of yogurt but not a sample size?  He didn't really get what I was saying so he gave me a non-dairy toasted almond tester which I had to choke down to not be rude, but I hate non-dairy and I don't like almond so how do you think that made me feel?\n\nHe gave me another tester but it ran out onto his thumb, so I was grossed out.  Does he wash? Presumably, but...\n\nAnyway I realize that's a nitpick *but* it does make for a weird experience.  And... there weren't enough cheesecake bits.  I want enough to fill a garbage can.  A large garbage can.\n\nAnywayyyyyyyy... despite those minor issues I would definitely recommend this place-- yogurt is as good or better as mojo and yogurtland and the selection is definitely better than Mojo."""""""

<review>I make sure to stop in here every time i am in the Phoenix area.  Great music and excellent service make this a place worth checking out for a few of their cheap drinks.  Tuesday evenings a great house band called Chocolate Fountain will keep you grooving!  Great local bands take turns filling the stage through out the rest of the week and weekend.  Venus is one of the nicest bartenders in the valley and she will pour you an honest drink as will all the staff behind this bar.  Oh yeah bar shuffleboard on hand for the sporty types.
</review>
<review>I have to admit, I was kind of skeptical about this place, but it turned out pretty damn good. It was a Saturday night and the place was completely empty for most of our meal, which usually is a sign that you should run out the door as quickly as you can, but we stuck it out and I had some really really good pork tenderloin. It was a tad on the pricey side and it felt a little creepy being the lone couple in a room that seats 200 people, but the trade-off was some extra-good service.\n\nI'd go back, sure.
</review>
<review>I love this place. It's great for the following reasons:\n\n1) super chill, laid back feel\n2) AWESOME jukebox\n3) cheap drinks!!\n4) you can actually have a conversation in there\n\nSo to go in a little more detail about point number 3... my first time there, I ordered my regular at a new place, whiskey and coke. The bartender pulled out a pint glass, filled it 3/4 full with whiskey, and charged me the price that small dixie cup drink at any bar in scottsdale would run you. FANTASTIC!\n\n'nuff said.
</review>
<review>My first and only experience there was excellent. The service was exemplary - the server knew the menu, was enthusiastic about it, and assisted us in choosing our items without being pushy. The food was exceptionally prepared and tasted excellent. The tzatziki was the best I've had. Nice and thick, with cucumber and spiced well with herbs and garlic. The spanikopita was also exceptionally with fresh clean tasting spinach and delicately textured phyllo dough. The pan fried calamari reminded me of Europe, fresh tasting, delicately fried in olive oil and not in the least bit chewy. The pita bread was warm and fresh and for dessert, the baklava had a complex flavor and tasted home made. \n\nThe environment was tasteful, old world European and exceptionally clean and organized. I will be back!

<review>This is a review for the pizza take out.\n\nThere are a few levels of pizza in the 602.\n\nTop tier is Pizzia Bianco, Cibo, Federal PIzza, et al. Those are NOT daily pizza choices, to me they are special occasions. \n\nEveryday kind of awesome pizza is Red Devil! Light years ahead of NYPD, Streets, etc. this place is legit! I highly recommend trying the pizza 'well done' which gets you more char on the crust. It's super good. This place also has really great wings, which surprised me. I ask for all drums, as those little wings aren't worth the trouble.\n\nKeep up the good work Red Devil. You are an oldie but a goodie.

<review>"""whoa man....i thought these types of places were way over priced for \organic\"""" food....thus i never go there (or sprouts or whole foods or anywhere else that makes me feel bad for not eating orgainic and charging me double/triple for the same bananas that come from chile). but man, this place rocks. we got one of their salespapers in the mail this week, and all the produce is so much cheaper. and it looks fresher than my neighborly fry's next door. and cage free eggs were cheaper too....holy toledo. i wouldn't buy my canned goods here, but from now on, sunflower is THE place for us when it comes to veggies and fruits!!!"""""""

<review>This Ace is close to my home and they usually have everything I need as well as staff members who know what they are talking about.  The person I like to work with most is Sam.  He really does a great job of helping me find what I need and suggesting better ways to do perform a task if my initial description is incorrect.  \n\nThe rest of the staff is helpful and courteous and the prices are in line with any other place I visit for home projects.

<review>I've been to the Wy-Knot Cafe twice.  Each time I've walked away feeling full, satisfied, and inspired.  The full, satisfied part came from eating healthy, delicious, freshly-cooked foods.  The inspiration came from talking with Jackie.  She's a dynamo!  I love the creative energy of the place.  There's something special going on there, and I recommend it to anyone who is tired of the same old restaurants, the same old foods, the same old.  I wish there were more places like this one in the valley.  You go, Jackie!

<review>If there's German food or beer in the Phoenix area, you better bet your bottom dollar I'll know about it. \n\nI came here the day after it had opened and it was pretty slammed but we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a seat. While we waited, we were able to go over to the bar area and get ourselves a beer. The beer list is so great, it took me 5 minutes to decide which one to get first. I started with a Bell's draft for the wait (I know, I know - getting an American beer at this place? But Bell's is the bees knees and not many places have them on draft so Brat Haus gets a big star for that). \n\nOnce we got seated, the waiter came over and was extremely friendly and attentive. Every time I go to a restaurant shortly after they open, there's usually always some hiccups - spotty service, out of certain menu items, etc., but that wasn't the case at all! Everything seemed to be running smooth like they'd been open for months already. \n\nI got the spicy brat and the #5 Hefe for dinner. We also split fries and the pretzel. Hands down best pretzel I've ever had! \n\nThe ambiance is great, they have a beer menu to make even the most decisive person become an indecisive little girl, and the menu makes me want to keep coming back until I try everything. \n\nGo here.

<review>I have been going to Sassy Glasses since I moved out here, about 4 or 5 years.\n\nI originally went for their frame selection - which is FANTASTIC!\nI think of eyeglass frames as jewelry, and since I need them on my face 24/7, I always have a few pairs. (You wouldn't wear the same pair of earrings every day, would you? Well, ok, I wouldn't).\n\nThey definitely have the coolest frames in town - not necessarily the trendy boring 'names'; these are mostly European  and  Japanese cutting-edge style, but with enough 'interesting' basics for your everyday pair.\n\nThey are locally-owned, unlike most other shops in the Valley.\nAnd to the previous reviewer who said they do not make their own lenses - well, I have news for you, I don't think I've EVER been to a shop that DID - even when I lived in NYC and Boston - at least for my prescription, which is a VERY complicated one, prisms and astigmatism and progressives and diopters. No matter where I've lived, my lenses ALWAYS take a week to order and receive.\n\nWhich brings me to - Ouida  and  Dan take the TIME to make sure they have my prescription and measurements CORRECT, unlike another nameless chain place I went to here in the Valley once (and will never return to).  They KNOW what they are doing. \n\nAnd they are really really nice, unlike some of the snobby shops so prevalent in the Valley. Have been in a few of those places to browse and I felt like I was being scoped out as to whether I could afford the frames or something! (and I try not to dress like a schlump). And I have no confidence that those places would get my lens correct, anyway.\n\nS.G. even made me a special pair of glasses to wear for when, as I normally do, sit with my laptop in my lap with the TV on, with the progressive line moved way up so I could see both.\n\nSassy Glasses IS a bit pricey, but I've discovered (see above) that you get what you pay for, at least on the lenses.\nWhich is why I am a long-term customer.

<review>"""We used to live right by the Tempe location and were spoiled by our proximity to great food and beer.  Now that we live out of state, Four Peaks is but a happy dream.....until this past weekend, when we found ourselves back in the PHX for work reasons.  Got a great deal on a hotel near the Scottsdale 4Peaks and dropped by to indulge ourselves for old times' sake.  The food and service are consistently good and the atmosphere is always fun.  Our dinner that night consisted of the Hopknot IPA ($4.50 I think), soup and sandwich combo (Santa Fe chicken soup and roast beef sandwich, $7) and Garden burger ($9).  All were fabulous.  The soup was nice and spicy and the burger was delightfully moist and juicy, just like a \real\"""" burger.  :)  \n\nWe raise a glass to ya, Four Peaks.  Cheers!"""""""

<review>Eat lunch and chill out, perfect! \n\nI'd never heard of Rumbi until I got some coupons in the mail (yeah, I said coupons, I'm not ashamed to use them) So I figured we would give it a shot since we were burnt out on all the other local convenient eateries. \n\nIt was cool and calm (as in not bustling with people making your lunch suck) inside, I liked the island decor for a change, it was hip, but the best part was the reggae beats pumping through the speakers, LOVED it! \n\nThey have several bowls, salads, wraps, sandwiches and burgers to choose from. \nBut what do they have for vegans you ask? \n\nWell this Vegan got the Organic Tofu bowl (see pics), with teriyaki sauce and the Rumbi rice which is rice and red beans simmered in coconut milk, so delicious! I got the half size and it was still two portions for me. \nA lot of food lightly dressed in the sauce with zucchini, carrots, celery and broccoli that was not overcooked. \n\nIt was much fresher, much tastier and not greasy compared to a Pei Wei bowl. \n\nWe shared some Rumbi fries too(see pics), half sweet potato and half regular, solid choice, nice and crisp. \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and accommodating and the restaurant was very clean.\n\nIt's nice to know I have another accidentally vegan option out there, I will go back.

<review>Just cashed in our groupons for these bad boys a few weeks ago and had a great time, even if it did mean getting up before 8 a.m. on a Sunday. The staging site near 4 Peaks was easy to find and the company provided all the gear we'd need-- helmets, goggles, water, confidence, you name it. Luckily it had just rained the night before so instead of dust flying everywhere, we got splashed with mud. I'd rather get muddy and have some great views of the Valley sans pollution than ride through a constant cloud of dust, a la Pigpen.\n\nThe guide was super experienced and he let some of the faster riders up towards the front and the slower riders in the back so people could go at their own pace. We of course managed to get squashed in the middle behind a couple who couldn't decide whether they wanted to be speed racers or terrified school girls. That kinda put the kibosh on us really letting loose, but we still managed to pick up some speed along the way and really enjoy the trail. Since we weren't allowed to bring anything with us, the guide provided water and even took our pictures so we could download them later. \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend Stellar Adventures if you're looking for a little half-day trip or want to treat some out-of-town guests. It's a little pricey though, even with the groupons, but worth the splurge if you're up for a little action.

<review>What a great addition to this city. A german style beer house with it's own beer garden and a graffiti wall that changes every four months. A great food menu and even better beer selection. I definitely want to get a large group of friends together to go here and have our own little Oktoberfest any time of year. The only downside was the service, the waiter looked like he would rather be anywhere else in the world. He never smiled.

<review>WHAT!? First off, why have I not left a review for this place. After all, it was Yelp that helped me find this supa-dupa-awesome office. Secondly, if you are looking for a new dentist, I HIGHLY suggest this award winning (litterally) dental office!\n\nMy history: My experience with the dentist hasn't been bad. I don't have many-to-any dental problems besides the fact that, like everyone else, I don't floss enough. I come from Ohio, where the waiting list always seems long to get in. Maybe, that was just one office.\n\nIn the middle of the Summer of 2011 I started having bleeding gums. Not just when brushing, but just gushing out (I know, graphic). I tried to tough it out, especially since I had an appointment with them about a week later. I woke up with massive blood clots in my mouth and so I called them at like 2am asking them to see if they could fit me in that same day.\n\nThey called me back as soon as they got into the office and said they had a cancelation for later that day to which I agreed to. I went in and it was quick and easy. I remember my mother filing out tons of paperwork but this was easy. Maybe times have changed a lot since then?\n\nIn any case, they got me in, and out, quickly when I arrived. They did a smal little clean for the area (I had a popcorn hull that had seriously impaled my gums) and signed me back up for a deeper and more extensive clean a few weeks after that. I did that, and even though they did a deep clean, they did a normal clean because I didn't need a deep clean.\n\nSince then I've had one other routine cleaning and I love it here. It is effortless.\n\nBonuses - they give you nice little shades to wear so that you're not blinded by the lights. Secondly, if there is an issue, they will take pictures of it and show you on the TV screen in full glory. You REALLY get the message then.\n\nI've dealth with Amber, Mary, Kathy, Kaysie, and Dr. Tom.

<review>"""Thank you lttle frog! Finally a good eats place near Harkins 16 on Bell, never able to eat antwhere close before or after a flick.  On this occasian I did not want to see anything so I dropped the kids off and started yelping to find a place for a quick bite before picking them up.  It was Happy Hour and I ordered pulled pork sliders (comes with two) which were outstanding and served with their ridiculously addicting fries.  I left full and very satisfied, no pun intended!  Two not so good points:  I waited more than a few minutes before I was told \sit wherever you like\"""".  After this the service was prompt and server was very pleasant.  The other thing - in  weather higher than 100 degrees, going inside should be a relief, it was a little warm inside and very few customers.  What happens when the place gets hopping ( no pun thing again)?  I will definately be back with the low carb hubby soon!"""""""

<review>Packed back behind other shops in Old Town Scottsdale, this is a place easily missed but should never be neglected.  The sandwiches offered are both traditional and out of the ordinary.  With a kitchen taking up half the real estate, expect to get friendly with other customers as seating is at a premium in this place.  \n\nThe Reuben is a must for the first-timer, spot-on and delicious with every bite, best enjoyed with a locally brewed on-tap root beer.  I personally recommend the brie-and-pickle with sliced turkey, quite possibly the most delicous sandwich I've ever had from a deli-style restaurant, and equally enjoyed with a frosty on-tap cream soda.\n\nSamples of both the root beer, cream soda, orange cream soda and apple cider are available and all very good.  I wasn't as much a fan of the cide as the rest of the choices, it tasted like a slightly fizzy Martinelli's apple juice.  They also offer all the choices in float form and with exotic syrups such as prickly pear.\n\nA great place to visit in the neighborhood to get a taste of revisiting childhood and a past era.
</review>
<review>Nobody told these guys, You get what you pay for. \n-----------\nBecause otherwise, they wouldn't offer free high speed Internet, free hot breakfast, clean and spacious rooms - for such a stupendous price!\n\nI think this place was meant for people whose family come here to the Mayo clinic for medical care. \nIt is a true residential inn, with a full sized coffee pot, induction stovetop, dishwasher. They also offer laundry services as well as a computer room and free printing of airline boarding passes. \n\nIt looks like a new, clean property with contemporary interior design. Definitely worth the price, since other high end hotels would charge you three times as much for the same amenities. \n\nThe only weird thing is that the induction stovetop was rotated 90 degrees to save counter space (think of a photo that is rotated into portrait mode, rather than the landscape mode it was meant to be in).\n\nBut again, this place completely exceeded my expectations. Will definitely check this chain out next time I'm on travel.

<review>I don't ever write reviews on Yelp or reviews in general for that matter BUT I promised myself I would do this when I got home from vacation. \n\nMy boyfriend and I stayed at Orange Tree Golf Resort for our anniversary. We didn't golf, we only stayed at the resort but this review isn't for the lodging; it's for the customer service. \n\nMy boyfriend's car battery died when we were on our way to dinner for our anniversary so he asked one of the staff members if they could help jump his car. Not only did the staff members help but when they realized the battery was completely dead, they helped remove the battery from the car, called Wal-Mart to make sure they had the same car battery so we could exchange it, shuttled us to Wal-Mart to pick up a new one, waited for us to exchange it, shuttled us back and installed the new battery for us. We didn't ask them to do anything other than help jump the car and it wasn't part of their job description to do any of the things they did but they did it and we couldn't have been more grateful. \n\nI'm so glad to see that there are still nice, genuine people around when others need a helping hand and I'm glad that they work at Orange Tree. Awesome experience with their staff. I would definitely stay here again and the customer service alone makes me want to recommend Orange Tree to anyone who is looking to visit Scottsdale.

<review>This is the best BBQ and pulled pork I have had since Virginia! I was told it was good but could not fathom it until the first bite, then the second and third.......... The flavor carried over to all of their meats served and everything else at the buffet was worth the 20 minute lunch wait. I got the buffet not because I actually eat enough to get a lot of food but so I could try a little of everything. Too bad only open for lunch but in today's economy that tells you something if they can make it only serving lunch.\nNOT greasy as some have tried to say - I cannot stand greasy food and it's a BBQ joint of course the meats got sauce........\nNow GO!!!!
</review>
<review>This is one of my favorite restaurants, and I seek them out any time I travel, hoping upon hope that this city has one.  It was just as good as I remembered.\n\nWe had lobster lollipops and cocktails for a starter.  My Chopin-Vodka Dirty Martini was perfect.\n\nAs usual, the Macademia Encrusted Mahi Mahi with a side of rice and the Chocolate Lava Cake (that you have to order at the beginning of the meal) were the stars of the menu...to me anyway.  They're just so damn good, I can rarely bring myself to order anything else...although I have before, and it's all good!\n\nBeautiful view and friendly service.  1 Appetizer, 4 meals, 1 Dessert, and 2 rounds of drinks cost around $250 so prepare for about ~$60/pp or maybe $40pp w/o drinks, appetizer, and dessert.\n\nI would also recommend the Award Winning Clam Chowder and the Mixed Grill.
</review>
<review>I went to this place for the very first time on Tuesday to have a business meeting.  It was scenic and beautiful when we sat outside, for being the only 4 people there the service was probably on the slow side.  But we had time to sit and wait, since we had a lot to discuss and it perhaps they were being courteous and letting us talk, but a refill on the drinks would have been great for our parched mouths.\n\nThe burger was really good, I ordered a Kobe Bacon hamburger, which is 8oz of yummy goodness.  Although, I need to watch my weight I opted for sweet potato fries and they were excellent.\n\nThe burger was pricey but reasonable for the area and the Kobe beef, which I've had small portions of steak at other places and have paid a fortune for it.  \n\nNone the less, if you are there with friends, they will enjoy the view and the atmosphere.

<review>"""Ok, let's start with what this hotel IS NOT:\n\nIt was officially NOT designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The architect of record is Albert McArthur, though he sought advice from FLW on the \block system\"""" that was stylishly used on the place to great effect. \n\nBut...there are obvious FLW influences throughout the property (especially in the main building lobby), and  (because FLW was a true ****) he said in public that this is McArthur's design while privately trying to take credit. That being said, I am an FLW fan and was lucky enough to spend a lot of time in one of his Paradise Valley homes...and this place has just enough \""""vibe\"""" to it to make anyone seeking the FLW feel be happy. Ok, I digress...\n\nIf you are looking for a sparkly clean, no cracks, built in 2012, all amenities resort...don't come here. This property is old school charm and elegance to the max. The thing it doesn't (and shouldn't) have is that extra \""""something\"""" preferred by 30-ish middle America d-bags that only comes with a hip spa that paints \""""your lady's\"""" toenails with American flags. Gross. \n\nThis property is for anyone who appreciates old school luxury. The main building's \""""classic rooms\"""" are throwbacks. They aren't huge, the windows aren't perfectly sealed, you can hear a bit of your posh neighbors' conversations...but in this setting, wouldn't you want to?\n\nThe grounds are stunning and gorgeous and the staff was impeccable. \n\nI checked in and, after being asked twice if I was there for a special occasion, was given a free upgrade (to my already discounted December rate) to a suite overlooking the hills with a near private swimming pool. Problem was: it was TOO BIG for the two of us and we didn't want to be by the lovely tennis courts...we wanted the action. So they seamlessly transitioned us into one of the much smaller main building rooms. Bliss. \n\nWithin an hour of checking in to our new room, a knock came...behind the knock was a man delivering a bottle of sparkling wine, two flutes and a plate of six huge chocolate covered strawberries. Also on the tray was a note from the front desk guy (Frankie - you rock!) congratulating us on our celebration and expressing his hope that we liked the new room. Come on, that's a class move. \n\nAnyway, we immediately went downstairs, ordered a Monte Carlo and a perfect Manhattan, sat by the fire pit and watched the sun go down behind the gorgeous Camelback Mountain - all the time feeling more and more like Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn than a regular LA couple out to visit the 'rents. \n\nOld school luxe, charm and hospitality...low d-bag quotient. I love you, Biltmore, even if Frank Lloyd Wright wasn't your principal architect..."""""""

<review>"""Let me be honest. I'm kind of a snob. Maybe that's a dramatic statement to make, I don't know ... All I can say is I never had an interest in going to the old Willo House, which to me looked like a run-down old shack. OK, there it is! Judge me if you will! \n\nI stopped into Hob Nobs on my way to Tucson with a colleague who needed a pick-me-up. Having already had my coffee that morning, I tagged along with the intention of leaving empty-handed. That did not happen.\n\nEverything smelled so delicious, and the environment was warm and cozy ... I ordered a chai tea. \n\nWhile the barista made our drinks, my colleague was chit-chatting with someone else who perhaps was the owner, or at least the manager. \Waffles?\"""" she asked me. \""""Oatmeal?\"""" She had a huge grin and was clearly joking with me. The staff member/owner/manager said, \""""the oatmeal comes with bananas on top.\"""" \n\n\""""Bananas?\"""" I asked. \n\nThey laughed at me.\n\n\""""Well,\"""" I said, \""""If I can take it to go and actually eat it in the car, I'll have some.\"""" \n\nHe made my oatmeal with butter and brown sugar, then topped it with sliced bananas and strawberries. I then added a splurge of half and half. \n\nIt was the best oatmeal I have ever had."""""""

<review>This is not the place for wimpy car, people who do not like dust, or do not like to do a little manual labor.  A nice rock yard that quickly weighs and loads your truck with rock and send you on your way.  The selection is decent, I guess there could always be more, but thee stones they have work with the local environment.\n\nThe y also deliver, but not sure of the minimum requirements.  They have big dump trucks, I think they said 20 tons or so.  That is a lot of rock.

<review>After finding out that my tires needed to be replaced, I decided to shop around a bit for some halfway cheap tires.  My car is a bit pricey when it comes to parts.  Discount Tire ended up being the best price I found.  They even were able to fit me in before the end of the day too (even after showing up around 2).  The service was good and they were able to have my car ready when they said they would.  What more can you ask of a tire shop?
</review>
<review>Have only eaten here once, but man...it was incredible!  Perfect for a romantic evening or with family and friends. Wait staff attentive, personable, and efficient. \n\nOlive oil to die for with the bread, amazing wine selection, mouth watering food. Daniel's has it all! I had a grilled veal chop, with an arrugula salad. Washed it down with a chianti reserve. Ended with a classic tirimisou and coffee. Perfect!\n\nWant to try something new? Want to try someplace that impresses without even trying? Daniel's is it.

<review>I had the worst of all things to do today.....put my beautiful old, dying pit bull...Miss Peaches down. I had moved and hadn't connected with a clinic yet. I was online and on my phone. The lady on the phone sounded so warm and understanding.....I got there and all three ladies at the front were absolutely delightful and very understanding.\n\nThey made the experience as easy and wonderful as it could be....yes I am devastated but they were very very understanding and I would recommend them to anyone.\n\nThank you...

<review>Great new spot for happy hour on Mill.  They opened last year for a while, closed for a few months and then opened back up late last year with new owners I think.  Good drink specials on beer, wine and cocktails.  Great appetizer specials ( $5 prime rib sliders are my favorite) and a cool urban vibe in the bar.  Nice outdoor patio seating and outdoor bar if weather permits.  Bartenders are always friendly.   Dining room is a bit more upscale and I hear the food is good but we haven't done dinner yet, I'll let you know when we do.

<review>I just moved to Phoenix and found these therapists online. I went in to see Trina this weekend and was so impressed I had to make sure to add them to Yelp as soon as possible. \n\nI chose Rustic Sage because I have always had good luck with massage therapists who work at places that only do massage. When I lived in Chicago, I went to Urban Oasis, when I lived in Boston, I went to Inman Oasis (not affiliated) and here in Phoenix, my choice is Rustic Sage. These women are exclusively there to work on your body in a serious way. This is not a salon or even a beauty spa kind of place. Instead, it's about healing yourself physically and mindfully. Trina, my therapist, genuinely wanted to help me feel good so I can maintain peace of mind. \n\nIf you're the kind of person who is looking for someone to help you figure out why your back hurts or what the source of that knot in your shoulder is, this is a great place to go. I have been seeing massage therapists for a long time and never received the kind of treatment before that I got from Trina. She helped me work out the pain in my hips and my IT band and afterwards even showed me some exercises to do in-between appointments. \n\nI also like this place because it's not *too* Zen. I like the nature theme and the peaceful lighting but it's not cluttered or too homey. It's clean, modern, and when I visited I immediately felt calm and quiet. \n\nTrina and Wendy told me that they're moving to a new space (the Fifth Avenue Downtown Scottsdale address) on September 11. They're having a grand opening and will soon have more therapists; they'll add yoga classes as well. As I left my appointment I met the yoga instructor, who was coming in to see Trina for a massage. She told me about the classes and seems like a truly smart, kind, down-to-earth person to take a class from. I'm definitely signing up. \n\nHaving just moved here I can't believe how lucky I am to have found this place! Very highly recommended.

<review>Don't be put off by the looks of this small, outdoor restaurant. The food is excellent! \nA few tables surround a large open bar, all with a view of the smallish man-made lake that sits inside an upscale housing development. As we ate, we watched a beautiful sunset over the lake, and also saw a few homeowners guide their boats up to the restaurant's small dock. \nEverything was delicious, from the hot crab and artichoke dip through the entrees to the dessert. I like to try something new, so I ordered salmon tacos with mango salsa and chipotle mayo, My husband is more traditional, so he had the Torpedo -- a man-sized prime rib sandwich with plenty of tender meat. I was tempted by the brie quesdadilla with candied walnuts, and my husband wants to go back for the Southwest pizza. \nAnd for dessert? Get this -- they bring a hibachi to your table so that you can roast marshmallows, dip them in a pot of melted chocolate, then roll them in graham cracker crumbs! Unfortunately, we didn't have time for that luxurious experience as we were on our way to an event, so we got the New York cheesecake with berries to go. \nAround the bar, the crowd was young, with some middle-aged people, and a couple of seniors. But they all were having fun, which made the mood of this small place happy and lively. \nThe place is owned by a husband/wife catering team, so the menu may change with the seasons.

<review>"""I was lunching with my boss, so against my initial desire to order something expensive, I ordered a moderate-cost item... the special of the day, which happened to be Squid and Shrimp in a Pepper Sauce. \Just like mom used make,\"""" read the chalk-written board.\n\nOh. My. God. This turned out to be one of the best meals of my life.\n\nPepper sauce in my mind was a black pepper sauce. No. This was something entirely different: sprigs of fresh (white?) peppers on the vine, mixed in with a red-chili sauce. Squids and shrimps swam happily in this red pool of nirvana, which was not a pool at all but a firm, gorgeous, complex sauce combined with oodles of perfectly wok'd fresh spinach. Honestly, this dish knocked me out of the water. So succulent and unexpected.\n\nWaitress was new and not entirely familiar with the menu but helpful and friendly. When I stated I wanted it \""""really, really hot\"""" she asked me to confirm but did not put up a fight about it. Indeed, the dish arrived as I ordered it: really, really, really spicy. My mouth was on beaucoup  fire and it was orgasmic... every bite of it. Waitress also explained that there are two levels of absolute hot: \""""Thai Hot\"""" (which is what I got) and \""""Chef Hot\"""" (which is the highest hot of the land). Great information.\n\nWe were seated at the back booth next to the window which turned out to be not such a hot spot, because we were in such close proximity to the obnoxious guy at the table next to us who chose to ignore his date in favor of his cell phone. My message to women on first dates sitting with guys yacking on cell phones: \""""You can do better than that!\"""" Next time I will ask to be seated in the outside atrium area for this reason.\n\nAwesome, awesome. Five stars!  Thank you, Malee's, for a superior dining experience."""""""

<review>I thought I had the address wrong the first time I went here.  This is a huge corporate complex - where the heck is the sandwich shop?  I decided to give it a shot and parked in the parking garage.  As I walked in I was REALLY taken with the amazing landscaping/fountains/hidden conversation spots all around the outside of the building.  I wanted to get a job in the building so I could eat my lunch outside there every day.  So I walked into the building and... nothing.  No signs of Dagwood's.  Then I realized that right in front of me was an area w/ small tables, a sofa and some nice sitting chairs facing a tv.  I had to ask someone when they walked out if that was Dagwood's.  It was.  So I walked in and went to the side to find that the entrance for Dagwood's is officially at the back of the building - but even there I couldn't find a sign.  \n\nA really amazing selection of sandwiches.  They had SO many options.  And they do breakfast - gotta love that.  The sandwich was good and all, but my favorite part was walking outside to eat (I love Phoenix! - My first time here was November and I've eaten outside in December and January too!) where I found some round shaded tables where I could eat lunch while looking out at their fake-lake with ducks swimming back and forth.  Not bad for 5 minutes away from a very industrial part of Tempe.  If you work in the area, it's definitely worth a stop.

<review>My friends and I went here for Sunday brunch/lunch this past weekend after we found that R and R had a two hour wait. We wandered here by chance and I'm really glad we did. It is such a cute place with warm decor and awesome chandeliers. Totally my style. We were waiting for a table but decided to go ahead and eat at the bar since the table we were at was comfy enough for our group. We ordered a variety of menu items including chilaquiles, a beef torta, the chicken and waffles dish and a side of chipotle honey grits. Everything was to die for! Our bellies were full and happy - always a sign of a good time. Our server, Lauren, was super nice and really helpful. This place was busy but in a good way and I plan on going back for more!

<review>"""I have taken two \Taste It Tours\"""" and I honestly am ready for my third asap. As soon as I knew Taste It Tours existed I knew that it was something I had to do. A food tour is what my family and I joke about doing every time we visit a new city so when I realized there was an organized tour I could take them on in Phoenix I signed us all up.\n\nThe first tour we took was the day tour which was a blast. Not only did we get to try some new, unique, local eateries but learned about the history of downtown Phoenix at the same time. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and the food was amazing. My favorite stop was Fair Trade Cafe which I have already visited at least 3-4 times since the tour.\n\nThe evening tour was just as great with even more amazing restaurants to check out. I was even more impressed with the menu/drink samplings and restaurant choices this go around. There was more of a focus on the food  and  drink versus the history which was a nice change from the day tour.\n\nOverall I would highly recommend this tour to anyone and everyone that loves food  and  wants to learn more about great local restaurants. In addition I would suggest you go for the $10 drink samplings since it only adds to the fun! \n\nThe Taste It Tour Team knows what they are doing and has done their research to provide the customers with the highest quality experience.  Can't wait to check out their new tours!"""""""

<review>We just tried the new BLT steak at the JW Marriott Camelback Inn last night.  It was their third day of service.  Despite that, we were treated to excellent service, great food, and awesome experience.\n\nFirst of all, the resort is newly renovated and it looks incredible, like a lodge in the desert with views of  Camelback mountain from the patio.  The dining room is open and airy - not as trendy as Bourbon steak.  Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!\n\nThe Cote de Bouf for two entree ($86) was perhaps the best steak I've ever had - with bone marrow and bacon and mushroom ragout on top.  \n\nSides were good as well as the salads.\n\nPrices were high but I thought worth every penny.  \nWelcome, my new favorite steakhouse in town! (at least until the new one opens at the Phoenecian)

<review>If I were to set up a market this is how I'd do it.  All of the essentials and then some, reasonably priced, friendly staff, easy to navigate and get in/out.\n\nTry any of the house brand stuff - most of which is delicious and cheap.  Hit it at the right time and you can score huge on the discount aisle.\n\nTheir coupon/points system is easy and can save even more.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've been to my old place since they opened this one.\n\nGranted, if you have a huge family and typically go to Wal-Mart and buy in bulk, this may not be the place for you - but if you have a small family, are single or are in a relationship with no kids - score.

<review>This was my first time that I stayed at any Hyatt Place, and I was pleasantly surprised by the results.\n\nI booked this room through Priceline, when I was determined to finally use their name your own price service.  I bid on a 2.5 star in Tempe for $39/night for two nights.  Total it cost me about $95.   I checked the rates on the website which were $180 a night.  I saved about $260 for the stay. \n\nThe room itself was nice and spacious, and included a living room area, wet bar, desk, and bed room area.  The room was really sleek and modern looking, and the bed was comfortable.  There was also a huge flat screen that was really awesome for watching some tv.  A few negatives were: the bed room and living were separated by a wall extending halfway into the room, that served no purpose; the bathroom was sort of small; the soap and shampoos really smelled terrible.  \n\nThe location of the hotel is good for travelers who are staying overnight near the airport, and close to Tempe, but you definitely need a car.  My room was facing the freeway and noise wasn't an issue.  The hotel itself offered a nice continental breakfast and the staff was very helpful.\n\nI would definitely try to win this on priceline again.

<review>Help!  Escape from the crazies at Spring Training!  Ahhhh... Grimaldi's courtyard is an oasis in the middle of tourist overload.  And the pizza--I mean, the toppings were fine--but the CRUST:  the texture and flavor are outstanding.  It's thin, yet holds up to the goodies on top and stays perfectly crispy. :) The Mediterranean salad is cool and refreshing on a warm, sunny Arizona day.  They make their own desserts from scratch, but I could not eat another bite.  The staff--everyone I met there-- were all great, and so was the service.  Thank you, Yelpers, for guiding me here!

<review>"""I'm all about supporting locally owned businesses.  Louisiana Fried Chicken is one of them.  Located adjacent to South Mountain Community College, a Maricopa colleague of mine mentioned this place as an option for lunch.  (She also mentioned that her brother works there.).  From her mentioned of \fried chicken\"""", it enabled my craving for it for lunch.  \n\nAnd it did not disappoint.  The chicken was flavorful, along with the rice and roll as sides (you can choose either rice or fries).  The best thing I noticed was that unlike your other fried chicken choices (i.e. chains such as Church's and KFC), the chicken was not too greasy.  I appreciate this from a viewpoint of someone who tries to eat healthily, yet allows herself the occasional indulgence.  Well, I didn't feel like I indulged (that much), and more importantly, I didn't feel sick/nauseated afterwards like I normally do when I eat greasy, fried chicken.  \n\nLouisiana Fried Chicken is a must for all you southern cooking lovers.  Plus, the prices are affordable.  Definitely, a quality fast food option."""""""

<review>What a great ball park!!!!\nWatching a baseball game under the lights with the roof open in early / mid spring in Arizona, doesn't get much better than this.\nMy party was spoiled as we were given a suite over looking left field (??)\nso we had really good seats, and clean toilets!\nThere are a ton of typical ball sports eateries at chase field, hot dog vendors, pretzel and beer vendors, pizza, etc...\nIf you're in the PHX area and are looking for something to do definitely check out Chase Field.

<review>Probably the best 500 calorie salad I have ever had... The BBQ Chicken Salad is an illusion how they make this salad for only 440 calories is insane.. I will be eating this salad four times a week, My wifes Quail was so rich with the whipped sweet potatoes at only 375... RIDICULOUS! The food and service are 5 stars, but the atmosphere feels quite corporate and forced, The live piano Bar in the Lounge is kind of creepy.. Just my two cents.. But if you are looking to shed a few pounds.. Seasons 52 would have to be on you rotation list with True Food, Blue Burrito, China Lite, and The Chili at Wendy's:)

<review>I am glad to have a Wine/Beer/Liquor superstore in the neighborhood.  Before the only options were along Camelback at AJ's on Central or 44th, and Sportsmans at 32nd.  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of Sportsmans, but Total Wine's selection is second to none.  I have yet to really question their staff on their products, so I cannot speak to their knowledge, but my guess would be that Sportsman's knowledge will still be superior.  The price point at Total wine is absolutely amazing.  It is obvious that they are not marking up their product as much as the other stores are forced to.  They aren't simply taking the money from the consumer, but are passing savings along to the customer.  Great to hear.  I look forward to many purchases at this establishment.

<review>Perfect Sunday lunch.  That's not a bad way to start a review I think.  We went here last Sunday right before going to the movies.  We ordered the Cold Seafood Combo; it was crab legs, peel-n-eat shrimp, clams and oysters. Plenty of food for 2 people.  It was a really slow there but that's fine by me.  The beer was very good and cold. For the meal for 2, plus we each had 2 beers...it was only about $50.   We spoke to the manager and he gave us a coupon for next months Lobsterfest, buy one lobster get one free.  So of course we'll be back.
</review>
<review>Normally the food here is to die for so I'm going to give this a fiver. Kung Pao Chicken and Dry Chow Fun are always a hit. Last night we ordered the Satay tofu and vegetables and it was definitely not what we expected. It came with vermicelli noodles and a watery chicken broth. We were expecting it to be in peanut sauce but was far from it. We wont be getting that again but we also paired it with Chicken Fried Rice which was a whopping 5 dollars. I'm not going to lie, this Fried Rice was the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Chinese/ Hong Kong style cuisine!!! Don't you dare order off the AZ menu, try something legit off of the Hong Kong menu :)

<review>For my first time staying at a Westin and visiting Arizona, I was very pleased with this hotel. The staff was friendly, welcoming, and my room was amazing.\n \nI was surprised by getting a nice and comfortable room on a higher floor and the view from the balcony was breathtaking. I stood on it every evening and morning. Bring a camera! The beds were even better...the pillows, heavenly and super soft. I slept better in that bed than I have in my comfy one at home. I was later pleased to hear that they sell them on their website. Smart. I had to get up early to work at a conference hosted in the resort that week, but if I could have stayed in bed longer, I wouldn't have stopped hugging the feathers out of these amazing pillows. \n\nMy favorite things about the resort (besides the awesome beds) were the saloon and the Deseo restaurant. May have been one of the best dining spots I have been in a while. With phenomenal wines on the menu, dishes filled with a melange of delicious flavors and fresh ingredients, and their bread is some of the best I've ever had. I would highly recommend going on a nice dinner date here or out on a business dinner. You won't be disappointed! The saloon below the lobby is also a great spot to grab some drinks and enjoy some bourbon or scotch. \n\nIf you are a golf enthusiast, they have a large golf course on site. By far, I will say that the fire pit outside is THE best amenity of this resort. With comfy large couches surrounding the fire put, drink service available, blankets there to keep you warm, this is the perfect spot to lay back and relax with friends in the evening. Everyone should have a fire pit. At 5pm every day for an hour, the hotel has a very talented Scottish bagpiper who wanders around the fire pit and golf course, entertaining those outside with some great music. \n\nI would love to stay here again sometime! This place is quite nice and may be my favorite hotel that I've had the pleasure to stay in thus far.

<review>"""I've been to Mimi's numerous times and the meals and service often have been mediocre. However, I give this particular Mimi's four stars because of the excellent service my family received on our recent visit. Our waitress was perfectly attentive -- not too bothersome, with just the right amount of \popping-in\"""" time to make sure we were happy and content. What sealed the four-star deal was when we left and my sister and I forgot our take-out boxes, our waitress ran out to us to bring them to us.  I was so impressed!  That has NEVER happened.  I give hundreds of kudos to good service, and this was definitely one of those cases.  Oh, and the other great thing about Mimi's: their to-die-for French onion soup.  It's AWESOME!"""""""

<review>Gotta love this place. I just tried Falafel for the first time in my life at Pita Jungle and it is AMAZING! I had the Falafel Pita and my waitress suggested I pair it with their spicy Chipotle sauce to drizzle on top. Their garlic mushrooms are to die for, and the cilantro jalepeno hummus is surprisingly refreshing. Not terribly spicy like I suspected. We went on a Thursday night around 6:30, very busy, chill atmosphere with a live jazz band.

<review>Great outdoors store that has just about everything.....I have never bought anything here, but has been a great place to take people to sight see.  I have even taken children here to check out the huge fish tanks, stuffed animals(real ones) and all the unique gear that goes along being a hunter, fisher, or outdoors type.  \n\nI am sure the prices are not the best, but you go here for the huge selection of unique tools and equipment that is special to these recreational hobbies.  \nAnyways if I was an outdoors type, hunted, or fished, or just curious on taking up a new hobby this is a place to check out.

<review>This neighborhood sushi bar is one of the best in AZ! Fresh fish, good portions, and great service. A place where not every single roll is filled with imitation crab and drenched in sauce! Majority of their sushi menu is pretty traditional...but the sushi chefs takes special requests if you give them an idea of what you like. I especially like the Cucumber Fiesta, which is a salmon/yellowtail/tuna roll wrapped in cucumber instead rice.\n\nThe staff is also very attentive. They check on your need often and clear out empty plates promptly. The thing that stood out most was the number of customers who are regulars. As I wait for a table, I always see people greeted by name and received with hugs. There must be a reason why people constantly come back, right? Check this place out and judge for yourself!

<review>i do love me some mini golf, even though i am not that good. lol. but hey its all for fun right??!! it was pretty crowded for a saturday but then again its getting warmer so i didnt expect any less from it. prices aren't too bad. and there are 2 different courses to choose from i believe. it seemed even more crowded because of the water park, so if you dont like screaming children running around then stay away! the course we chose was a little slow but it got moving once everyone got their games going. usually when i play i dont keep score because im not that competitive, but my boyfriend kept score and that only made me want to kick his butt, but that didnt happen because i get in this mindset of how im gonna totally win and yeah. lol. but i cant wait to go back again. this place is definitely good for parties too. they have a pretty good size arcade inside as well as a food place to get like hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza, etc. the water park also looked fun and since i hear it gets to be like 120 degrees here in the summer time that definitely sounds like a good plan.

Loved the feeling upon walking, very \homely\"""" an authentic. I was confused by the italian/asian menu, but intrigued as well. Should I mentioned I've been 3 times since I first went there only 1 week ago? I've ordered their bento box (which changes daily), a steal at only $10! I've had their sushi twice.

<review>"""Tott's is some of the best Chinese food in the area. It's insanely affordable, large portions, and NOT the hole-in-the-wall, mom  and  pop, lighted-pictures-of-the-menu-on-wall-against-a-floral-backdrop style place you've read about in Fortune Cookie Chronicles. (Which is a fantastic read if you like Chinese food  and  history.)\n\nInstead, it's clean and modern inside, and Young, the insanely nice owner or brother-in-law of owner, is always very kind and generous and funny, to boot.\n\nNow, the food. You'll need to check the menu before you order to make sure they have everything you're used to. While most Chinese restaurants all pick from the same playcard, Tott's bills itself as an \asian diner\"""" and so standbys like moo shu pork are absent. To flesh things out, they add a handful of curries and some other pan-asian dishes you wouldn't normally see. (In the same vein, delivery service is also absent!)\n\nNow that that's out of the way, ignore everything I just said and order the orange chicken. It is the best I have EVER had. (I make sure to order it \""""not crispy\"""" since the shards-of-chicken approach is UNpleasant to me, which they abide by perfectly.) When it comes out fresh and uncrispy, there is no greater. It is just a bit spicy and has some red chile-type things in the sauce, so be prepared, or ask them to tone it down, but it comes out fresh, and hot, and amazing. \n\nTheir chow mein is also fantastic. It's chow mein as it should be: soft noodles, not dry at all, and with tons of vegetables. I have them throw in shrimp, and they always include a big portion of just-right cooked shrimp.\n\nI usually tap things out with an order of their great crab/cheese puffs. They're a bit light on the \""""crab\"""" side, and might be \""""krab\"""", but the flavor is amazing and their sweet and sour sauce is fantastic. Some of my favorite cheese puffs, pretty much ever.\n\nIf you dare order the pork rolls, a word of warning: they are an entire meal in and of themselves. They are the about as thick as your arm and there are two of them, served with sweet  and  sour mixed with spicy mustard. They are so big that they have to rubber band the foam container.\n\nThe portions are huge for dinner, and at about $11 each, you EASILY have two meals out of them.\n\nTake the time to hit up this place for a different take on great chinese food. And if you ask Young for the orange chicken, not crispy, don't be surprised if he thinks you're me. (That's usually how he recognizes me!)"""""""

<review>My friend and I when here one day for lunch and we were both very impressed. Both of our dishes were beyond delish! We also had kiddos with us and though they didn't have a kids menu they still catered to them and had no problem they were with us (of course they were very well behaved). I took a look at their dinner menu and though it is a little pricy I really want to go back and give it a try. I love all of the seafood options! Service and atmosphere were both very nice as well.

<review>I love this library nestled up in North Scottsdale. The architecture is beautiful and the exterior surroundings are nice as well. There is plenty of seating inside and seating outside as well. The exterior seating is under a covered area to shield you from the sun.  I really like the tables inside the facility that are right next to the tall glass windows because you get that natural lighting and get a chance to peak outside as a break from whatever you at the library for.\n\nThis library, as probably most if not all, features free wireless internet. There are also many HP Touchscreen computer terminals available. The monitors are really large. I'm not sure how big exactly, but it's probably more than 20 inches. There is also a circular, central seating area as you walk through the main entrance. The seats are in a circular pattern with little tables on the side that you can swing around that are big enough to sit a laptop on.\n\nThere are also other features to this library, but what I mentioned earlier are what I'm more familiar with. I visit this library every now and then on the weekends. It's never incredibly busy, but I'm not sure what it's like during the rest of the week. The hours are kind of limited on the weekend because their closed on Sundays.

<review>Since we brought some gift cards with us that I got free using a points program we went for lunch. We are very familiar with Earls back home and what to expect. This location exceeded them.\n\nWe had Leroy's Crispy Dry Ribs($9.75). They were really good. They had the right amount of s and p and were meaty and not fatty.\n\nThe husband had Los Cabos Chicken Tacos($13.00). While there were only 2 they were stuffed!.\n\nI had the Pecan Chicken Maple Spinach Salad($15.00) Mmmmmm it was amazing! There was lots of bacon, brie and cherries :P .\n\nMy only 2 complaints are that the chicken in my salad should have had a more crispy coating and the mojito I ordered was fresh but oh so weak and I am not a real drinker but I love strong mojitos.\n\nThe service was great and we will be going back!

<review>07/15/07\n\nThe quintessential New York Deli...or at least what I am told one should be (having never visited New York).  \n\nSolid, satisfying, hot and cold sandwiches with a variety of potato and salad (macaroni, etc.) side options.  Cafeteria style, so know what you want by the time you get to the counter.  It's a great place to go on Sunday morning and read the paper while you enjoy a carved sandwhich.  Of course, there is nothing heathy about any of this food, but it's solidly tasty and satisfying.  Slightly pricey (hot dog special is a good economic choice), but the atmosphere is relaxing, always clean, consistent quality, and they have free self-service water, so you don't have to bother with getting back into line if you're still thirsty.  \n\nWhat makes it unique is its authenticity and distinction from chain and fastfood stores.  It's not particularly interesting food, just good to satisfy your deli cravings.  Plus, I believe it's locally owned with gives it actual personality.\n\nCome on Sunday and then walk down to PetCo. (or is it Petsmart?) and visit the adoption dogs.

<review>This is a very nice dog park, even by my high san diego standards. Knowing that this park is around the corner from my grandmother's house makes visiting her a lot easier; we can actually exercise the puppy and tired her out so much that we don't worry about her knocking granny over! \n\nIt's a good size, with a separate area for passive dogs. each area has fountains and surprisingly good grass coverage. my only wish would be for more shade - there are nice trees around the perimeter but they're too small to shade more than a few dogs at a time. \n\nthe water fountains could be a tiny bit better, too - the tall one has so much pressure that i heard the water THUNK into Amalia and she jumped back and wouldn't come near it again. the short one had almost no pressure at all and Amalia had a hard time getting a decent drink. \n\nthe area was poop-free, and the owners were attentive to their dogs. i haven't seen any issues between dogs, and there is enough space that if there is a personality conflict the dogs can be separated and still get some running in. \n\nit's a very nice park. we'll be back, every time we visit.

<review>Wow..What a Treat!!! Great Service and the food doesn't suck!!!  LOL.. Stopped in for a quick dinner..had to wait (what's new Scottsdale)..Bartender was very friendly, but not overtly friendly (you know what I mean)... Table was ready and he gracefully asked to have my tab transferred..I refused and paid him..Hell, why shouldn't he get the tip... Waitress was awesome, very knowledgeable and pointed out their specialties. I opted for the Ahi Salad...Home Run!!! What a great Salad!!! Hit every point that the Menu said.. I should have gone 5 stars, but, I went 4... Don't get me wrong, but this is one to check out for sure..Great Service...Great Food...and Not Really Scottsdale Prices!!

<review>There's so few fine restaurants in Scottsdale that aren't part of a chain from LA. I'm glad I had the opportunity to have a few tapas at Tapino while I was in town. The outdoor patio is ideal for the warm desert air; and the pink glow of the couches look inviting for a couple's first date. \n\nOf course, tapas are best shared in groups. And in our group of four, we cleared: escargot in garlic butter, deep-fried cauliflower with aioli, roasted artichoke, fish and chips, pork taquitos, flatiron steak, lamb kabob, duck confit, and beef carpaccio. You'll have to go to the restaurant to read the descriptions of each dish. I really can't do them justice in a truncated Yelp review.

<review>It's hard to get away from everything when you live in a big megalopolis like Phoenix.  For a brief time, the canals can give you a break from our busy streets.\n\nI like to bike on the canals and as it gets warmer I'll start to go at night and get the ever so slightest cooling effect from the water.\n\nGet a map (from online or bike shops) and you'll find out that they more prevalent than you may have thought.   Go for a ride!

<review>So glad I stopped in here! Was a last minute check in after I found out I was released from being on call all day! In need of a pedi bad and this place is right down the street so I went in at 5pm. \nI went for the ultimate spa pedi (decided to really treat myself!). Was not disappointed one bit!! For 49.00, got all the add ons, hot scrub, hot lotion, paraffin wax soak , a hot stone foot massage and the results= two very happy and exhilarated feet!! My tech was Kevin and he was awesome!! The place is beautiful, quiet and liked the fact that the pedi stations are in back and away from the front. Felt very relaxed and soothed!! Thank you Biagio and Kevin!!

<review>My wife and I ate at this Chick-Fil-A this weekend and I liked it. She eats there all the time and has been trying to get me to go and I wasn't disappointed. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and some chicken tenders. Lemonade was awesome. More importantly the service was great. Everyone seemed to have such a great attitude which I appreciated. The person at the registrar was Camry and she was very helpful. We told her we were going to the movies and she told us where the theater was and how to get there quicker. I appreciated that she took the time to tells. My wife was impressed with how kid/baby friendly this place is. From diapers in the bathrooms to Cheerios in small cups for hungry kids, this place rocks!

<review>I hadn't heard of this gem until the second round of groupon offerings came out. For $10, I bought $30 worth of goods. It sounded like a good deal. I live in West Mesa now so it was a long drive for us but we were both good and hungry. \nWe were warmly greeted and well served after we found it (tricky). \nThe ambience is best described as warm and cozy - pretty intimate. I counted the total number of seats in the place: 28. \nTJ ordered the pork entree with a side of carrots and the creamed corn. I ordered the pasta dish because I saw it arrive at someone else's table and was intrigued. \nI had a white sangria and TJ got the blood orange mojito. \n\nThe entrees were delicious, truly. Mine was piping hot, fresh, just the right amount of creaminess and I was surprised at how perfectly cooked the onions and peppers in my dish were - still crisp without being under cooked. The pasta, too, was right on. The chicken and the chorizo - a little chewy. \n\nTJ's portion didn't fill him entirely. He helped with my dish and I still had a box to bring home.  \nHis mojito was truly wonderous - must find out how to do that at home. My sangria was just okay. It had little apple slivers in it that I found unappealing due to aged texture. I'd stick to the mojitos in the future and would only go back for happy hour pricing because with those four ordered items and our $30 Groupon credit, we still spent $43.00. \n\nI'm not sure about the price/quality/quantity ratio. It would have been nice, too, to have some fanciful little breads or crackers or chips on the table before the entrees came out. Didn't happen. I'd say don't go starved and don't bring kids.

<review>Another new-to-me car, another hassle free loan from AZFCU.  I actually tried Desert Schools FCU first who quoted me an outrageous 12% rate!  Screw that!  Back to AZFCU, where in about an hour I had all the paperwork completed for my 7% loan and a check in my hands.\n\nThe only real drawback is that I can't pay the loan online.  Well, at least not from another bank account, my regular checking account is with Chase.  On their website, all you can do is check your loan balance and make a payment from another AZFCU account.  So this remains the last establishment for which I actually write a paper check.  Cute.

<review>I LOVE PV!\nThe nature of this bar can appropriatley be summed up in one word, this word has been thrown around describing the pv lounge far more than any other as far as im concerned: dive.\nyes and if that frightens you, or that isnt something that draws you like a moth to a flame...or a wino to a dive bar, then for heavens sakes piss off and dont come here! \nFor the rest of us that like our beers and pool cheap, our tunes on the loud and punkish side, and our bars divey then you'll love the palo verde lounge. everytime i have been here i see something worthwile:\na fight between two hobos on the way there, punk bands from denver too drunk to properly play, vampish girlies that'll steal your soul at pool with a sly wink, and kids smokin chiba from a beer can in the back alley. It never fails to disappoint! \non the decor:\nIt's about as big as my apartment inside ( and my apt is TINY!).\nthe bathroom is about as equally disgusting as any hovel i have ever been to. There really isnt much room when there is a good band playing here- but who care's!? \nrub elbows w/ your barmates and make acquaintances! everyone is usually really cool and talkative, every time i have been there is someone new to meet.\nThe PV is just one of the best little bars in the area, and its on the way to and fro from yucca or time out, so stop by for a drink on your ride home!

<review>We went here attracted to the grand opening banner that advertised $1 hot dogs and $2 burgers.  That sounded yummy, so we decided to check it out.  Pulling up I noticed they advertised real charcoal grilling and sure enough they cook everything to order on a charcoal grill behind the counter.   We were not asked how we wanted the items cooked, but the man cooking the food had been interacting with us, so I asked him to make my two hot dogs well done and he made the perfectly.  The toppings for the hot dogs and burgers looked fresh.  We ordered the macaroni and cheese which was also delicious.  I really wasn't expecting much other than a plain ole' hot dog, but it was really, really good.  We enjoyed the TV's that were playing, they are excellent quality and the world cup was on.

<review>I enjoy the Cityscape area.  Plenty or restaurants and parking.  Parking is free for 2 hours if you get it validated.  And it is only 2 bucks an hour after that.  They also offer some shops and I really enjoyed the Christmas tree lighting and ice skating.  Where else in Arizona are you going to ice skate outside, in front of a Christmas tree, and its 80 degrees outside? The ice ring is right on Central Ave. and you can still go and enjoy it till Jan. 5th.  How cool is that? \n\nPretty cool NRG covers the energy cost to keep the ice frozen so we can do some ice skating and enjoy Christmas in Arizona weather.  I hope Cityscape continues to thrive and the restaurants and shops continue to expand.  So far they have been doing well.\n\nI have visited Charming Charlies, Stand Up Live, Lucky Strike, The Strand, and Tilted Kilt.  All great places and all within walking distance.  Go check it out.

<review>This was so good I wonder why Mongolian BBQ hasn't sprung up in every city (hint, hint Alabama!) When you go in you pay for either a small bowl ($9) or a large bowl ($10). I got the small bowl and still had enough left over for another meal. \n\nThe ingredients are spread out in a buffet. You go along the buffet and fill your bowl with whatever you like. I chose chicken, lots of veggies and rice noodles. The trick, from what I can tell is to shove as much food in your bowl and then using the handy wax paper they leave out for you, smash it down into your bowl so you can fit even more in! At the end of the buffet are tubs of different sauces and a chalkboard with  instructions for different combinations. I am a bit of a traditionalist and mixed up the Mongolian sauce. You then hand your embarrassingly heaping bowl to the cooks who quickly stir fry it for you and then hand it back.\n\nCan I just say oh my God was this delicious without sounding vain because really I sort of cooked it myself? The ingredients were super fresh!  There is also a small bar with soup and rice, but I wouldn't waste my time with those if I were you! The BBQ was delicious and fun to prepare!

<review>It was my parent's 27th anniversary so my mom asked if my hubby  and  I would like to join them for dinner, of course we would! Typically my parents would go to Outback or Olive Garden but I asked if we could please switch it up  and  my mom told me to pick a place. I had received a postcard from Ocean Prime for $25 off  and  thought why not? It must have been meant to be because my mom got one too  and  said she was thinking about trying it out also. I called  and  made reservations for Saturday the 26th at 7pm. \n\nThe place was packed when we arrived, literally every table was filled. The design was very sleek  and  modern, with neon blue lighting. We were seated at a table near the bar  and  Rebecca was our server, she was awesome! \n\nFresh bread  and  butter were immediately brought out, yummy. We started off with the colossal shrimp cocktail  and  half order of oysters. My hubby  and  I shared the shrimp cocktail, 3 HUGE pieces of shrimp with dry ice underneath, very cool  and  very tasty. My parents shared the oysters  and  loved them. My dad is a scotch man so he ordered a couple johnnie walker's with club soda. I am a vodka girl so I decided to try the berries  and  bubbles cocktail. OMG was this cocktail delicious, the pieces of fruit  and  dry ice sent it over the top, I loved it so much I had 2. My hubby went with the tequila cocktail  and  thought it was just ok, I knew he should have stuck with his usual captain  and  coke. \n\nOn to the entrees. My dad ordered the 7oz filet mignon (med-rare), my mom ordered the salt n pepper tuna (WELL DONE! WTF, WHO DOES THAT? I TOLD HER NOT TO BUT SHE INSISTED, UGH.), my hubby ordered the sea scallops  and  I ordered the twin lobster tails. For sides we all shared the sauteed wild mushrooms  and  jumbo asparagus with hollandaise. We all sampled each others entrees  and  everything was amazing, except my mom's tuna since she ruined it by ordering it well freakin done, but my lobster tails were the crowd favorite. Both side dishes were delicious as well. We were all so full but decided to get dessert since we were celebrating. We chose the chocolate peanut butter pie. Damn was it good, somehow we all managed to make room  and  had to keep ourselves from licking the plate clean. \n\nI brought that $25 off postcard I mentioned earlier  and  so did my mom. I thought they wouldn't except both at one table, but since we were paying with 2 cards they let us use 1 on each card, awesome! So with the promotional $50 off our total came to about $230 (not including tip). A tad overpriced, (which is why I only gave 4 stars) so I don't see us coming often, but we all thoroughly enjoyed our dinner so for a special occasion it's worth the splurge!

<review>Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.

<review>Best description of this place would be Chick-fil-A play land meets Pump-It-Up.  My kids love this place.  They're moving and climbing non-stop whenever we are there, so I love it.  We had their birthday parties there about 6 months ago.  Overall, I think the kids had fun. The only downside to the birthday parties is that you can't have a private party unless you do it afterhours, which is sort of late for young kids.   I think its $9 for an open session.  My only other complaint is the quality and price of the food.  I think its Sam's Club food.  They charge $2.00 for a not so great hot dog.  Also, I think they need to vacuum more often; the floor appeared to be pretty dirty.  They say they vacuum everyday, but I'm not so sure about that.
</review>
<review>Service started out bad.  We likely sat at the bar for a good 15 minutes with no employee saying anything to us.  Once we started to get served drinks though the bartenders were friendly and attentive.  \n\nGreat happy hour.  Had some lemon cocktail with fresh raspberry puree on top.  So good I drank 3!\n\nHubby had the antipasto plate and wasn't that thrilled with it.  I had the soft pretzel bites with the cheese fondue.  It was FANTASTIC!  The best soft pretzels and cheese ever.  I can't recommend them highly enough.

<review>"""Heaven, I have seen thee and thy name is SAS Fabrics by the Pound.\n\nWhy do I need green, faux mink fur right as the weather begins to warm up?  I dunno, but damned if I'm going to leave it here and hope to find it next fall.  I'll find something to make and some way to sport it if it kills me.  \n\nWhat I DO know though (well, now I know, anyway) is that it's not superduper smart to go to SAS without an honest to god pattern that you're ready to cut and sew in your hand.  There are just too many luxurious fabrics in beautiful prints and colors to play with, every aisle you walk down.  Sure, there's some junky stuff, but whatevs, just keep going and before you know it you're fingering the prettiest, shiniest, brightest silk or brocade or taffeta that you've ever seen, and you're imagining the ballgown that you'll make out of it.  Hey, one never knows when one will need a ballgown, so get off my nuts!  And just in case you do, there's plenty tiaras and whatnot to complete the look.\n\nThey do carry lots of notions, some too many and some not enough. There are BINS of loose buttons, if you care to sort through and find all the matching buttons you need.   I don't think I saw a really great selection of laces and ribbons and other trims though.  The thread is super cheap, but the color selection is a little thin and I'm not sure if it's any good (most of them had \family dollar\"""" stamped on them, and at .20 a pop, who knows).  Needle selection is next to nil, and the ones that they did supposedly have were almost all sold out.  Other helpers, like fusible bonding and stuff are probably pricier than you'd pay somewhere else.  And of course, there are no patterns at all.  Long story short, go to Joann or something for your patterns, SAS for the fabric, and then back to Joann for your notions.  \n\nAnd DON'T BUY THE GREEN FAUX MINK FUR, unless you plan on checking with me every time you leave the house in it, lest we see each other out.  How gauche!"""""""

<review>I have lived in the area for years and always passed this place wondering what it was.  Finally, my Husband and I decided to give it a try...we had no idea what to expect.  The place is very intimate.  Some of the tables are long with benched seating so yes there is a possibility you may sit next to strangers.  But who cares when the food is as YUMMY AS IT IS!!!  The menu pretty basic but has many options for a Pasties.  I ordered the Carne Adovada it was AMAZING!  My Husband got the Pesto Chicken he raved about how delicious it was (didn't try because I do not like pesto).  We ended with dessert some apple caramel sauce with ice cream it was to die for!
</review>
<review>Free books, free movies, free mags, free wifi, comfy chairs with foot stools, self checkout, drive thru pick up and drop off, coffee, very separate children's area...ahhh....true love.  \n\nFirst off, the building is gorgeous with a zen-like front outdoor sitting area complete with the sound of running water.  It's open and airy, and just a relaxing place to be.  The set up is great - children have their own area with plenty to look at and explore, while adults have their own place to study or enjoy a book in some peace and quiet.  Definitely my favorite Scottsdale library, and yes, I've been to them all.   \n\nNote:  You may want to avoid after school from around 3:30 - 6:00pm....those kiddies from across the street can get noisy, giggly, and sometimes obnoxious.

<review>We are huge fans of Cartel Coffee Lab. \n\nThe Mrs. is a coffee nut so we drive all over in search of the best cup and the best beans. It is one of our two very favorite places.\n\nFirst of all, their coffee beans...  We are firm believers in getting beans that are locally roasted. We've subscribed to the belief that flavor is lost  as you get too far out from the roasting. Cartel roasts their own and does a ridiculous job. They do a great decaf and a number of interesting and excellent regular varietals. If you don't already buy locally roasted beans, do yourself a favor and give Cartel's a shot.\n\nAs far as their in-house coffee drinks, the Cartel folk are pretty much obsessive in their pursuit of excellence. You won't find the million varieties of crazy drinks they now do in many coffeehouses but  you will find excellent drinks done by people who are serious about what they are doing. I for one, am happy to roll with their recommendations when I am there and enjoy my whole milk, leaded latte with agave syrup. \n\nThey also have a Clover machine (which many say does the best brewed coffee) which does 1 cup at a time. You will also see the beans individually packaged for the clover right nearby. One of the philosophies the folks there have expressed is that you want to get the beans brewing as soon after grind as possible. They've even minimized the number of steps you have to take to do this.\n\nCartel Coffee Lab is also a very, very cool place. It's kind of tucked away in a strip mall off University back behind Eastside Records. They've taken this industrial space and kept some of that which adds to the charm and also have put very cool local art throughout. Some of it changes which is also nice. They've also fabricated some things like the bar and space dividers which give it a neat look. Their roaster also sits out in full view. In addition to all this, they always have great music playing. Something about sitting down on one of those couches with their background music instantly relaxes me.\n\nAnd the last bonus for me is that with them being so obsessive about coffee, they also sell some great equipment in the front. We bought our burr grinder from them and couldn't be happier.\n\nAbout the only thing about Cartel that is disappointing to us is that they have recently stopped pulling decaf espresso shots. From what I understand, this happened because they switched their grinder system out for a better one. I hope at some point, they decide to grab one of their own burr grinders for sale and reverse this change.\n\nIf you haven't tried Cartel Coffee Lab yet, it's a must.

<review>There is lots to love about this place, and I want to start with the service, attentive, friendly, and gracious. Our servers took such great care of our big table on monday night, that I have to give the place 5 stars before even one plate of food was served.\n\nAbout the food we planned the visit around Cien Agaves terrific Happy hour, so there were lots of tico tacos $1.50 ea and half price appitizers on the table, rounded out by a few entrees. Everything I tasted was delicious, especially the Chicken Quesidilla. Normally I would skip a chicken Quesidill on almost any menu, but I am so glad I didnt this time. Just the right mix of seasoned Chipotle Chicken and Cheese in a huge folded and grilled tortilla, with sour cream. This is by far the very best restaurant quesidilla in town. Everything served was great, and raves about the food came frome everyone.\n\nThey have great drink specials during happy hour as well, including 1/2 price margaritas and special priced beers. It's the tequilla selection that is special though. It's an amazing selection of some of the best tequillas in the world. You can even try some tequilla flights!\n\nInside the place is funky/cool, super clean, with some really cool art and lighting.\nIn Old Town There are some real GEMS and a few DUDS when it comes to mexican food, but Cien Agaves might just be the very best choice for Mexican food in Scottsdale.\n\nI MUST SAY TO MY FELLOW YELPERS---GIVE THIS PLACE A TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<review>"""3.5 Stars.  Having been to many 24 Hour Fitness locations, this one is my usual stomping ground.  This location is just OK.  Other \Sports\"""" locations here and in CA are newer and hence - cleaner, larger and with better equipment.\n\nThis gym does offer decent equipment, but they could use a few more ab machines, some 40 pound dumbbells, and like someone else said -- a basketball court.  A number of 40 pound dumbbells have been missing for a while - like someone stole them, wtf? They also offer a number of extras - from the pool, spa, sauna, large aerobic rooms, chiropractor, and massage (extra charges of course).\n\nThe crowd here is typical of the area -- a mix of Central Phoenix/East Phoenix yuppies, local celebrities, soccer moms, and h.s./college students.\n\nLike most gyms in existence, they suffer from the after work crowd.  And sometimes in the crazy days of January and February parking (even with the large lot) can be impossible - I've turned around and gone home on a few ocassions.  But if you avoid those times, you will be fine."""""""

<review>"""I've been eating at Cyclo for many years now and I have never had a bad meal. \n\nI always start with the black pepper shrimp and since I've switched to a mostly vegetarian diet the past two years my choices have narrowed a bit, but Justina always modifies the food so it fits. \n\nOver the years I've had pretty much everything on the menu and whenever a friend asks me what to get I say, \Close your eyes and point, you won't be disappointed\"""". \n\nThe Vietnamese coffee at the end of dinner is a perfect ending to any meal. \n\nThe desserts are great and when I do get it I like the Mango Sticky Rice or the Creme Brulee. Both will not disappoint. \n\nJustina is a great and I think it is funny when people take her too seriously. She has fun with her customers and they should have fun with her. She can take it as much as she can dish it out so just relax. \n\nThere have been some comments that when Justina is not there the experience is not the same. How could it be? There is only one Justina and once you get to know her you'll realize she is really much more than a crazy hostess. She is a really nice person. \n\nI hope you enjoy Cyclo as much as I have."""""""

<review>I went here last Tuesday for my 25th wedding anniversary. I had been looking forward to visiting J  and  G ever since they took over from Mary Elaine's. We arrived at our designated reservation time of 7:00 PM but the restaurant was not very full. It is a beautiful place with one of the best views in the valley. It's modern and classy at the same time. Very comfortable atmosphere. My husband had a beautiful floral arrangement waiting at the table for me. We started off by ordering two of their specialty drinks. The Ginger Margarita ($12) and a special Kumquat Mojito. Both were very good. We were informed by the General Manager on a table visit that the Ginger Margaritas are the only drink that is in all of Jean-Georges restaurants worldwide. I ordered the tasting menu for $58.00, which gives you smaller portions of the following food items: Tuna Tartare with Avocado, Sweet Corn Ravioli in basil butter, Halibut with Miso Yuza glaze and Bok-Choy, Grilled petite filet with J  and  G steak sauce, sauteed spinach, french fries, warm chocolate cake with Carmel ice cream. My husband ordered the Porterhouse $60.00 with a side of mushrooms. They did give us a complimentary dessert of cheesecake with cherry compote and sour cherry sorbet. My husband enjoyed his steak even though he had to send it back to be recooked. My steak was also undercooked but I ended up taking it home so I did not send it back. The steak was not served sizzling hot and the glaze on the Halibut was very spicy. Service was average nothing to rave about. They did make an exception and let me order the tasting menu as I was informed by the server this menu is usually reserved if everyone at the table orders it. I think they wanted to make our anniversary special. I've had better steaks but I gave them four stars since they did go out of there way to make our evening special and the view is fantastic!

<review>If you are looking for authentic goumet Italian food, this is not the place to go! The food is simple but tastes great. Good for large groups as the place is huge with many different rooms to be seated in. They offer a complete dinner: drink, bread, salad, entree,  and  ice cream for around $11. I had spaghetti  and  meatballs, pesto ranch on my salad, very tatsy- the hot sourdough was awesome and a scoop of spumoni ice cream. They offer whole wheat pasta, and gluten free pasta options. Full bar and friendly service. Happy Hour M-F 330 6pm. Give this place a try. Cool location, fun atmosphere, cheap prices
</review>
<review>3 stars for food\n4 stars for everything else\n\nWe wanted to try something new and so we decided to try this place.  First of all, I love the fact that they have plenty of free parking; even on a Sat night.  The restaurant is actually much larger than I thought with the huge back room where we were seated.  \n\nSince it is a German restaurant, we were ready to try their beer but didn't have a clue as to which one...our waitress took delivery of bringing us samples to see which one we favor.  That was very nice of her.  After ordering the beer, we had the imported pretzel, Paprika Schnitzel, Sauerbraten.  \n\n*Pretzel = YUM!  It was crusty on the outside and very chewy inside.\n*Paprika Schnitzel = very much like Japanese cutlet.  Not as flavorful..\n*Sauerbraten = we tried it because we heard that it takes 4 days.  Honestly, the only thing we could taste was the thick sauce, the meat was kinda tough, and the pasta was bland.  On the upside, I liked the red cabbage.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience with live German music, great beer and pretzel.  \nBut would we go back?...probably not.\n\n*Ambiance = Wonderful!  It doesn't really feel like AZ.\n*Food = mediocre...we prefer more flavor\n*Area = good.  in the middle of old town Glendale.\n*Service = great.  we had a wonderful waitress who took very good care of us.

<review>Great happy hour.  We are old, and arrived early, and didn't stay past the end of happy hour, so I can't review NoRTH's dinner.\n\n4 people, 3 bottles of wine, 3 appetizers, 4 happy hours plates, and all less than $100.\n\nThe food is a mix of dishes that are eerily familiar.  The chicken sandwich is very similar to the breakfast sandwich at Olive  and  Ivy.  The gorgonzola chicken salad is the same salad I've had before at Sauce.  Good dishes, its just strange eating them in a strip mall on the west side.\n\nWould it be worth the money after 6:30 pm, when bottles of wine are not half off?  Probably not, and NoRTH would have received a 3-star rating from me.
</review>
<review>Awesomeness! So smart but It's a bit confusing for a fist timer. Them muffins are great wish they put more sandwiches and breakfasts on them. The place is so rules free I hope people do not take advantage because they give the customer the benefit of the doubt.\n    Pizza was nice, love to have tried the sweets but as it was January I was already way over my careful calorie count. The rockin tunes added so much though I am sure the format appeals to mostly a younger crowd. \n   Some Details, Counter Service until 4. Pizza day time only weekends. Sandwiches are picked up at a different counter than, pizza and burgers. There is a white bucket for your dishes.

<review>Our friends recommended Joe's farmhouse grill after watching it on Triple D on TV.  Upon entering, you'll notice a tv setup with clips of the segment aired.  We thought by arriving at 2 PM for lunch we could bypass the lunch crowd, unfortunately we were wrong.  It's still packed at 2 PM, which must say something about the food.  We decided to order the Burger, Ahi Tuna sandwich, onion rings, sweet potato fries, and a banana mill shake.\n\nBurger - was good, but not spectacular.  However, you could that the ingredients were very fresh .  \n\nAhi Tuna Sandwich -outstanding.  The wasabi flavor complemented the sandwich and this was delicious.\n\nOnion rings - worth ordering.\n\nSweet potato fries - good but you can get this elsewhere\n\nBanana milk shake - tasty!\n\nOverall, this was a solid meal to which we will come back during our next Giants spring break trip!

<review>Fresh, unique dishes that will leave you wanting for more.  We tried some of the sausages and a rare beef salad.  The salad was a perfect combo of salty, sweet, tangy, crunchy, and soft.  The beef, since it is cooked rare, is very tender, and because it is marinated in a sweet vinegary type marinate, you don't really notice the rawness of the meat.  The sausages were kind of reminiscent of Chinese sausage, except thicker and more savory/salty.  The sausage is red like Chinese sausage is, except it is more of a sweet/sour type sausage rather than mostly sweet like Chinese sausage is.  \n\nService was adequate, although they ran out of diet coke that day so I couldn't get my fizzy caffeine fix for the day.

The funny little pinwheel chips are great in the smoky salsa, the guacamole was amazing, and the chipotle sauce that came on the chicken and spinach dish was drool-a-licious.  Didn't have room for dessert because I pounded my food like that little Japanese hot dog eater guy.  Next time then.

<review>OK, now I've had breakfast here too. Thank God I rode my bike up here! I feel like a whale. I ate the strawberry pancakes and bacon. I know, I am a real health nut. I had to try the pancakes though after all I've heard, and they were pretty delicious. But the best thing by far was the freshy fresh squeezed orange juice. Oh my God, I am in love. Seriously I just paid $3.25 for 12 ounces of orange juice, and I would do it again in a minute. I only wish this orange juice cost the same as a gallon of gas so I could afford more of it!

<review>Went back to this lovely place for dinner when the weather is still nice ... \nAnd it's such a different vibe at nice ... this place is serene during the day but very lively at night with live music ... they have someone singing there and he was entertaining .... food is pretty good as well\n\nBut I would say the selling point of this place is the view you get especially at night, you can see the city light from there. Great place to sit back, relax and enjoy the night ...

<review>Saw the Hey Joe! food truck parked at the Mesa Arts Center food court for the Asian Festival and had to try it out!  I got the Lechon plate ($8.50), which included about 4 pieces of deep fried pork belly with crispy skin, a scoop of rice, and some pickled veggies (Carrots, radish, red bell pepper).  The order took a little time to be made, as there was a backup of orders from some customers wanting a lot of extras (Like 8 cups of soy sauce, or 6 to-go boxes for their plates), so the food wasn't out in quick time like I was expecting for a food truck.  The staff were very friendly though, and it's nice that they offer credit card for you to pay (No minimum order), and will send you your receipt through your e-mail.  \n\nThe lechon was very rich and flavorful.  It had a mix of juicy pork and crispy skin from being deep fried.  Although they give you just a few pieces, it is a pretty heavy tasting dish, and it was nice to add the rice and vegetables as lighter sides to balance out the meat.  Although very tasty, the price was a little high, considering I can get a pound of lechon for the same price at Heavenly Bakeshop in Chandler.\n\nOverall, it's nice to see some more uncommon foods here in the Phoenix area such as Filipino cuisine, and I'd like to visit their food truck again to try some more dishes.

<review>"""Tasty new addition to the Old Town Scottsdale area. Went on their opening day for lunch, then back again for dinner. They're still working out new-place kinks, but nothing serious.\n\nFor lunch I had the spicy brat and sweet peppers. For dinner the chorizo sausage and chutney. You can't go wrong on either the basic or premier sausages, but if you're unsure what to try go for a sweet/spicy combo. Like the spicy brat and a sweet topping, or sweet brat and spicy toping. If you like sauerkraut, it's all homemade (like the sausages) so give it a try. If you don't like sauerkraut, you're a strange person and should probably not go to a bratwurst house. And I feel bad for you. I'm sorry.\n\nWhere was I... oh yes, their belgian fries are great, and I am a fan of the sriracha aoli dipping sauce. Of course, they pretty much had me at \sriracha\"""". \n\nTheir beer list is very well rounded. I'm not a huge fan of belgians and german beer, so was a little worried, but there is plenty of great beer there to drink across the whole spectrum. Chatted up Ben The Beer Baron for a while, and he definitely knows his stuff. Don't be shy about asking him for recommendations."""""""

<review>I've come here a few times in the past, and now that Starbucks has free WiFi, I've found myself coming in on a more consistant basis.  \n\nI like it here because they have plugs at enough tables that I can sit with my laptop and not be restricted to just a few seats in the place.  Hours are great, and they obviously offer a variety of drinks and pasteries to choose from.  Service is great, and all around a good clean Starbucks.
</review>
<review>Came in today after work and friendly Matt the bartender was spot-on, which had me re-thinking this place. Yes, they are pricey, but damn it all if their pub atmosphere isn't just about perfect. I've tried their grilled cheese sandwich and bread pudding which were remarkable, and they have great beers on tap, so I know I will probably make this place a more regular stop, as it is directly on my way home from work, and I can forgive the initial oversight in my first review.\n\nA great place to chill from the summer heat!
</review>
<review>This is no Morton's.  Don't even compare it.  This is a thousand times better than the Morton's in Scottsdale.  With that being said, I want to commend the staff firstly on truly outstanding service from beginning to end. They were polite, timely with the food and on point.  Our compliments to the chef.  We had the filets, which were cooked to perfection. However, the meat did not have the excellent taste that we expected.  We had mashed potatoes (very tasty) and green beans.  The salads were generous and fresh.  We had flourless chocolate cake which was amazing.  I can't find fault with this meal other than the fact that we didn't find the taste of the filets to be as flavorful  as this type of restaurant should offer.   My compliments to the wait staff who gave us such great service.

<review>"""This is the perfect place to go for a leisurely brunch or lunch with friends.  I've heard some people say \that's where chicks go\"""" ...well, I'd say cheers to that, I guess we have good taste :)  \n\nThis place offers some really great menu items for health conscious people, which I really appreciate.  Sometimes I don't want to go to breakfast because it's just too fattening, but this place makes delicious meals that don't force you to go to the gym right after.\n\nGreat coffees, teas, and breakfast cocktails are a great added offering, plus the baked goods are perfect for a little indulgence. (hey, if you save calories during the meal, you can afford to split a pastry!! ...yes, I'm a horrible dieter.)\n\nEvery dish I've tried here so far has been wonderful, I really don't think you can go wrong with your order.  Make sure to check this place out."""""""
</review>
<review>My new favorite breakfast spot! Let's start with the Nutella crepes... Yum, Yummy in my tummy!  My friend and I were nursing a little hangover, so we were ready to chow down and ordered the crepes to split and our own meals =).  I had the omelet with a variety of cheeses, served with a fresh green salad and hash brown patty, it was cooked perfectly and I really enjoyed the salad on the side. I was also very impressed with their coffee, the strength was just right and served in a huge mug, so I only had to ask for one refill!  Because of the time we made it to the joint, other patrons were eating lunch, and I couldn't help notice a mouth watering bowl of tomato soup ... that will be on my next visit for sure!
</review>
<review>First Watch is a favorite of ours for breakfast but they also do a nice lunch too.   Get there early if you are going on the weekend, this place gets busy but they seem to turn tables rather quickly.\n\nLunch time, especially later, is generally quiet and relaxed.  Good time to dine alone if you are inclined.\n\nTurkey dill crepe is one of my all-time favorites - fresh mushrooms  and  spinach make me smile.   I like my potatoes and toast/muffin well done and they always get it right.  Also extra-crispy bacon - a side order is 4 slices - share w/ your friends but don't pass it up.  I also like their skillet breakfasts but you'd better be really hungry because these guys are big.  Did I mention french toast  and  waffles?  Yes, they are also really good.\n\nIf you're a fan, join their free SunE-Club.  They'll email you coupons occasionally and a free meal on your b-day.  Now that's something to smile about!

<review>Oregano's has been a favorite restaurant with our family since before we WERE a family (circa 1998). Even though we've never lived close to any of the locations, we've had so many great moments (and honestly, in 13 years, only ONE bad experience) at this local chain. We had our first date on University in Tempe and we had our wedding celebration party (after eloping to Australia) at the Scottsdale location. The front patio at the Mesa restaurant was the choice for my husband's 40th birthday party.\n\n Always great service! Great atmosphere (friendly, fun) and great food.\nOur two boys now love to come with us to the newest location (near our home in Ahwatukee--thank heaven!) on Elliot Rd in Tempe which will surely be our new local hot spot, as it is near my husband's work as well. WE ARE SO EXCITED!\n\nMy favorite items on the menu (although I admit, I'm finally steering away from my usuals so that I can try the rest of their extensive menu):\n\nKick BUTT Garlic Bread (be sure to order it with cheese and a side of marinara)--YUM!\nGuaca Tony (I only recently tried this and am sorry that I've been missing out all these years)\n\nChicken Ceasar Salad (dressing is SO good, and there's never too much of it) \n\nThe Sproccoli Deep Dish or Stuffed Pizza - have a little salad, which comes out quick; then wait another 20 minutes or so for the Chicago-style pie--SO worth the wait! (and so filling, you'll have leftovers for lunch the next day!)
</review>
<review>Another great dinner in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  We tried out T. Cooks for our Saturday dinner date.  Located in the Royal Palms resort, I enjoyed how cozy the resort and restaurant were.  \n\nWe got there a little early and had to wait for a few minutes at the bar.  I ended up with a espressotini which was delicious and satisfied my caffeine need.  The bar scene and I guess dining scene was unique.  Definitely a much older crowd, lots of couples, and lots of people wanting attention.  \n\nThe food at this place was excellent.  We started off with the cheese and prosciutto platter which was okay and we could have done without.  A huge loaf of bread and pesto dip was provided and was super yummy.  For my entree I had the fillet mignon with potatoes au gratin.  That steak was perfect and melted in my mouth.  My entree filled me up so much I ended up skipping dessert.\n\nService was great as well.  They took care of us but allowed us to have our space.   Oh and one final note, they have complimentary valet.
</review>
<review>Ohhh do I love gelato. Who doesn't? G-spot totally gets it.\n\nThe service is okay, not rude but not A+. That's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars.\n\nThe gelato is wonderful! Just like it should be, smooth, sweet, and decadent. I had the tiramisu, in a medium. It was a perfect serving for me [if you complain about the 'small portions', just remember it's a treat to be savored, not to fill your gut], and I love the little fact sheet hanging on the wall that tells you it's less fat than ice cream and so on.. it really pressures me to relax and not worry about blowing my diet [;\n\nThe store itself is very very clean and issues of 944 are on the little tables inside. Plenty of outdoor seating for the warmer days as well. I really like that the G-Spot is connected to Hava Java, because after gelato I was really craving an italian soda [cliche, I know]. \n\nIf you haven't yet, hit the G-spot.. it's not even hard to find [:

<review>"""I contacted Susan at SeaBlu because a coworker referred me to her.  I have always maintained my pool myself and always had a clean, clear pool.  However after the first dust storm hit the valley, my pool went from cloudy to brown to green in two days and nothing I tried worked.  It was one of the most frustrating times a \do-it-yourselfer\"""" could experience.  I called Susan, she was out at the house within a few hours and immediately got my pool under control.  She treated it that day, came back the next day to treat it again and educated me on what was going on the whole time.  In a few days, my pool reversed course going from green to cloudy and finally crystal clear.  Her knowledge of the issues and prompt service were outstanding and I was totally satisfied with the outcome. Rates are fair and communication was excellent.  Highly recommend her and SeaBlu to anyone that needs emergency help or just weekly maintenance.  Thanks for reading-hope this was helpful.\nCraig K"""""""

<review>Five Guys you woo me with your delicious burgers and fries! The burgers are fat  juicy, flavorful and delicious! These burgers are old school Midwest diner type burgers.....Greasy the way a burger should be! I don't know what the problem is in AZ The burgers and Fries are excellent! The service at this location has always been fast and friendly. \n\nThese are awesome big ole greasy burgers! GO EAT ONE!\n\nSide bar (Debbie S) Post your review once not on every location that you have never been too that is just plain RUDE!

<review>The entire staff here is really nice and know what they are doing.  They have somewhat odd hours, but they are really flexible with rescheduling and don't charge fees for missing an appointment.  They only part that annoys me is that Dr. Scharf tends to talk too much sometimes.  I don't mind shooting the breeze or listen to his interesting conversations with others, but sometimes I am in a hurry and wish he's do a little more cracking and a little less yapping.

<review>Ok here is the deal with Red Devil Pizza.  The key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot.  That is why I like places with brick over pizza's. They don't use Brick Ovens at Red Devil but  I have been told that Red Devil has some really old pizza ovens that are not available any longer or hard to get.  I can't verify that, I don't even remember who told me that, maybe I read it some where.  Don't know if it is true or not. What I do know is that Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  Their pizza is consistently good.  Thin-Crisp and delicious.  I have had pasta's and salads there as well. They are fine, nothing to get excited about. But the Pizza at Red Devil is something I will stake my reputation on.  Actually I don't really have a reputation, but if I did I would lay it on the line for Red Devil Pizza. The long and short of it is, I am very passionate about their Pizza.  Period.

<review>I decided to visit this place after reading about the owner in an article in the Arizona Republic. In my old job a coworker who sat next to me always brought in chocolate croissants for breakfast to share with me (from Albertson's bakery). This is how I got hooked on them. Then after several trips to Paris and enjoying the chocolate croissants there it was hard to go back to Albertson's chocolate croissants (last time I checked, however, Albertson's no longer makes chocolate croissants anymore). Anyway, my worries are now over as this is the best croissant I have ever had. Right here in the valley. My husband and I stopped by the other day and got the chocolate croissants while they were still warm. As we were driving away we decided we had to have more and turned around and went back for more. On our second stop we also purchased the Raspberry/Rose macaroon and, this too, was the best I've ever had. I haven't had any of their sandwiches or salads as of yet, but I will be going back for more croissants and macaroons for sure.
</review>
<review>Eccelente! I am constantly on the look out for Italian gente, and as soon as we walked into That's Amore, I knew I had found some. \n\nIt was late and a little girl was in the window. She told me her favorites: nocciola, amaretto, e stratacella - a woman of traditional tastes. Her father was cleaning up, and clearly ready to close, but he graciously served us. We shared short Italian banter - his daughter is clearly the talker in the family, and she loves to entertain. \n\nTheir selection of gelati is extensive. I have enough trouble choosing amongst 12 flavors, so this was just clearly going to be the biggest challenge of my night. I went with the little girl's faves - nocciola e amaretto. Delizioso. My date went for fruit - chocolate coconut and raspberry (lampone). Also excellent. The flavors are rich and the gelato creamy. Their store is fairly large and bright. Their display case is huge and its contents induce immediate salivation.\n\nTwo brothers and their wives run two locations. They are local, traditional, and a very nice family. I will definitely make the drive out to see them again. I love good gelato.

<review>Listen.....this ain't your average Mexican food restaurant. No Spanish rice and refried beans here! As the website states, its neuvo Mexican (with a bit of Cuban flare and culinary influence in my opinion). Oh, speaking of website. Theirs is just as enticing as the food. It's like a music video with a menu. It's sexy and food photography is amazing.  Check it out! \n\nI started with guacamole and salsa. Yum! The red Sangria was one of the best I've had in a long time. Not overly sweet with a nice kick! The (vegetarian) chile relleno was amazing! Stuffed with roasted zucchini,  onions and potatoes. The perfectly spicy ancho chilie was nicely contrasted with the sweetness of the veggies inside. \n\nMy only complaint was that I had to ask my server for a fresh order of corn pudding b/c it was over done.  If you're familiar from Southern corn pudding, its not really like that. Theirs is thin and more dense like corn bread. But very delish! \n\nAll the food was great and the atmosphere was rather unexpected for a restaurant in Tempe Marketplace. I was transported to another place. Refreshing. \n\nBon Appetite!
</review>
<review>To me, this is my favorite sushi spot and has been since I moved up to the Tempe area back in 2009. The Chefs are really friendly and service is great for the most part. \n\nNow, I only really get sashimi so if you really like sashimi, this place has- according to me- has some of the better tasting ones I have had around here. It's a great atmosphere and i'm probably bias because of my history here. \n\nHappy hour and reverse happy hour are great so if you haven't tried this place at least try it at those times! Try the albacore and salmon, delicious!

<review>I have been coming to this LA Fitness for five years. Whether that bodes well for me or not I will leave up to your discretion. I have seen better days before my metabolism decided to hibernate.\n\nWhat I will say is that there is something about this location that makes it way more comfortable than any of the other locations I have been to (7th Ave/Greenway, Elliot/Priest, Warner/Dobson, Scottsdale/McDowell). Perhaps it is the lower ceiling. Perhaps it is all the gay men. It could even be the nostalgia from the time I tore my hamstring. Who knows.\n\nHere are the only drawbacks I can see:\n\n1. Don't try to do cardio right after work on a Monday or Tuesday. \n2. You can easily become intoxicated on Saturday or Sunday morning... it seems all the party people feel the need to atone for their sins the night before by sweating it out in the morning\n3. Those personal trainers are suh-leeee-zeee\n4. If you dislike cutoff sleeves on men, this is their mecca. \n\nAmple parking. Cheap monthly fee of $24.99. It doesn't smell. Lots of equipment. \n\nGet off your fat ass and just go.

<review>Decided to go to Beckett's Table because of Yelp's reviews.  It was exactly as described.  We had to try the cheddar bacon biscuits and glad we did.  They were flaky, tasty and no butter needed.  And yes, we did the macaroni and cheese as well.  Listen, if were going to Beckett's table we were going to try it all!  The mac  and  cheese was a unique blend but it worked.  We also had the short rib dish.  The meat just fell apart.  The yukon mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious.  We may have overdone it but it was well worth it.  Plenty more to try next time.  Oh, and try an Arnold Palmer...mmm mmm!  Cool ambiance too!  Beautiful presentation  and  great service.  A nice surprise for the location.  Great place, give it a try!
</review>
<review>I stopped over at Lone Star for a quick lunch yesterday. The food was brought out very quickly after I told our server I was pressed for time. The Pork Chop was juicy and very tasty; I could have wolfed down another Pork Chop (it was that good). The gigantic Sweet Potato was delicious when coupled with a little bit of butter and cinnamon. I love their salads, but didn't have a chance to order one since I was in a hurry. The drinks are refilled on a timely basis. Lunch for two was about $22 before tip.
</review>
<review>Arrived 10am on a Wednesday and on a wait as usual. There's a reason for that, because they are that good. I waited for about 10 min (only me in my party) and was seated. Server was VERY prompt showing up about a minute after I was seated. She was very pleasant and gave me plenty of time to look over the menu. I ordered the Santa Fe scramble with hashbrowns and pancakes. My order arrived in under 5 min and they were slammed! Food was hot and delicious as usual. \n\nWatching the staff work was like watching a professional sports team. Bussers were clearing tables seconds after guests left and guests were being seated as the busser made his last swipe with the cleaning cloth. These people do it right and if anyone says you can't expect this at less than a 5 star place, they're dead wrong. Point them to Butterfield's.
</review>
<review>Can we say 'heaven on earth'?  Since I'm basically an over-grown child, Sweeties is the answer to my prayers!  I checked out past reviews before coming here, and I will agree that you should take a walk around before pulling any delicious candy items off of the shelves.  My heart soared as I took a stroll around the aisles and aisles of beautiful sugar-goods throughout the store.  If I am ever having a bad day; trust me, Sweeties is the spot to be!\n\nI tried to remain conservative with what I picked out during this trip but was surprised at the true variety of candy products!  I found Red Super Rope licorice (my favorite treat of childhood), which in the past I was only able to find online.  I also found Buckeye chocolate candies which I though only existed in Ohio and are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  There were treats from decades ago as well, which I was not familiar with, but I picked up some items that sounded pretty good as well.  \n\nThe only thing that would have made the trip sweeter would have been if the location was a little closer to my house, or at least closer to the 60 freeway...  It's right around downtown Chandler next to a strip mall and when I walked up I saw a couple breaking into their own car (maybe they left the keys in it?), and I'm not so sure about the neighborhood...  \n\nOverall, it was a success; I will be back soon!

<review>Title: Awesome Vegetarian dishes, fellow Vegheads!\n\nooo...My BFF and me hit this place after the Glendale Blues/Jazz Festival the other day and were pleasantly surprised. If you blink, you pass this puppy. We only found it cause we went one street too far wondering where we parked our motorcycles.\n\nWe're Veg, so we ordered from the Vegetable entree menu and split everything.\n\n#78 Vegetarian coconut curry  - Awesome flavor although I hate white rice, it all meshed together beautifully.\n\n#80 Flash-fried tofu with carmelized onions and tangy soy sauce - It's the sweet soy sauce that made this dish.\n\n#84 Bok choy soup with ginger and onions - amaaaaazing flavor. Highly recommended. Tasted good for leftovers too. mmmm. mmmm\n\nPrice was hella right, peeps. Only $6.99 for each of these delicious dishes. Say wha?????\n\nCheap date night fer sure!\n\nThere were only like 2 servers so the service was a bit slow but very friendly. \n\nAs of  4/9/11, they weren't serving alcohol per a few posted signs. I assume waiting for a liquor license to come through.\n\nWill be eating at this gem and recommending to friends every chance I get.

<review>I dream of the day I have enough riches that I can hang out in places like Royal Palms regularly. I mean the night I showed up, well it was night, but it was also pouring down rain, and even through all of that Royal Palms was pretty enough to make me stop and look around before rushing in out of the weather. I headed into the bar to meet up with a few folks and the interior is just a beautiful space - warm and welcoming, and very classy. Bring people here that you want to impress.\n\nI, of course, had to order a glass of champagne and the lovely server brought it right to me. Perhaps she sensed I had been delayed at the airport that day before arriving to Phoenix for 7 hours? Or more likely they are just very good at what they do here. We immediately ordered since it was so late and I started with a pear, pecan, and blue cheese salad. For my main course I choose a seared Irish salmon that was served with leeks, tomato gratin, and a pea puree. It was all fantastic, but the tomato gratin made me want to invite the chef to move to LA with me. I mean no way could I afford that now, but a girl can dream!\n\nWe finished by sharing a couple of desserts and the one I chose was the Florale. It was made with lychee mousse and was quite light and just a bit tart. All in all a delicious ending to a delicious meal.
</review>
<review>I would never have thought from it's quiet exterior that when I opened the door, the place would be bustling!  What have I missed!?\n\nI love this place!  I ordered a burger and fries for only $12.00 ($12.00 is cheap for a good burger in Scottsdale), and it was absolutely the best I have tasted in...as long as I can remember.  The pretzel roll made artwork of a burger!\n\nI love the prices and what I especially love (LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE) is that you have the option of a full or half order for almost every entree on the menu!  How sweet is that!?  (And health conscious!)\n\nCan't wait to get back there!
</review>
<review>I really Love this place!\nI stopped in for lunch and tried a couple new things. \n\nThe Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is:\nroasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter,\nsage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , it's available in two sizes I got the small one.\nThe sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch.\n\nI ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect!\n\nMy guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you can't beat that!
</review>
<review>"""Watch your bill.\n\nWe came in for a couple drinks during happy hour. We ordered them as \Vodka/Redbull and Whiskey/Coke\"""". They were served quickly and tasted fine. When the check came we found that our Waitress had decided to up-sell us without asking. When I brought it to her attention, she said, \""""OH Sorry, hehe\""""\n\nUPDATE: I called the manager, Kim, shortly after this review and was pleased with the results of our conversation. Since the Up-sale was really the only issue, giving them 4 stars."""""""

<review>Wife chose this place and we went late Tuesday (9pm) for dinner after I got out of school.  Owner was attentive and very helpful and helpd us order.  he explained dishes and brought usu a few different breads.  Dishes were VERY colorful, tasty, piping hot.  I asked for spicy and WOW..., on that scale, I should have asked for mild.... Yummy food and Great time.\nthe owner's family children were playing (read: screaming and running around jumping on boothes and staring at us over the wall) the whole dinner, which was mildy annoying in a quaint way..:{\nwe'll be back. maybe once school starts?

<review>Locally owned sub shop that also sells bubble tea and coffee drinks!  We came here initially looking for Quiznos but found that Sub Zone is here instead.  The deli meat here and veggies are very fresh, and the owners take pride in using high quality ingredients.  I was hoping to get a Quizno's type sub with premium veggie ingredients such as guacamole and mushrooms, but veggies here are more of the standard type you'd see at Subway.  The bubble tea option is new here, but I know that the tapioca used here is fresh, not frozen.  The owners here are very friendly and want to make you the best meal.  I'll definitely come here again to try more subs.

<review>I had to make the Great Circle trip to DoPho and CenPho, although I always think of it as GoPho (going to Phoenix...it seems like a long journey).\nToday I got to take a baseball bat to the temple twice in one day!\nI had to spend quality time with my accountant and more of the same with my health insurance agent...just one of those mornings.\nI needed to treat myself, although after a visit with my business friends, I somehow felt it needed to be an inexpensive treat.\nMy insurance agent is just north of Lucky Boy and that's where I went for my late lunch. I needed a scotch, and a Lucky Boy burger may not be the next best thing, but it's pretty damn good.\nI had not been here since last fall, but it really never changes (at least not since I came to AZ). \nThey just make a good, simple burger. There aren't any tricks (no butter flavored whatever on the buns). The fries are crunchy outside and fluffy inside. The buns are soft, but hold together well and the meat is charred, but not crusty and overdone.\nAre there better burgers in the Phoenix area?...I'd have to say yes. Are there better drive-thru burgers in Phoenix?...I don't think so. \nLucky boy is terrific...fresh, tasty, inexpensive (my meal was under $5.00), fast and the people at Lucky Boy are just extremely nice folks. Let's all do our  part and make them busier!

<review>"""My wife and I went here on our bi-weekly date night a few months ago. I da just gotten back from France and was still feeling good about my culinary experience. \n\nI was a little hesitant at first to believe that an American place could match the flavors that I enjoyed, oh so much, while in Paris. However, Petite Maison far exceeded my expectations. I had the dry vac'd steak (I don't remember what it was called, but it was the special of the day) and it was \Holy Shit\"""" good! \n\nAfter dinner, we had some cheese and a glass of wine. The cheese was amazing. They had all sorts of choices to chose from. We had the sampler, so we were able to taste something like 6 different cheeses.\n\nIf you have $75+ and want to have a great meal with your significant other, go to Petite Maison. You WILL NOT be disappointed.  \n\nMy only complaint was that my meal had to end..."""""""

<review>Are you listening Olive Garden management?  The hostesses were very friendly when greeting us as we walked in.  And the service?  Ashley was an AMAZING server.  I can't even think of enough compliments .  We were totally indecisive and she recommended wines and entrees and never rushed us as we looked over the menu.  Perfect timing for refills, etc., and seemed genuinely friendly and smiling.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, it has proven that good customer service does still exist!!!
</review>
<review>Somehow this unassuming place in a strip mall in Arizona is one of the better Thai restaurants I've been to.  I've been here numerous times, and each time the food is consistently delicious.  One of the best Pad Thai dishes I've ever had, and most of the curries have had have also been quite good (save the Green Curry, of which I've had better)\n\nLike most good Asian restaurants, you should come here for the food and not the decor/ambiance/service/whatever.  On my last visit the decor appeared to be in the process of being updated from it's previous hole-in-the-wall look, but wasn't quite there yet.  I've never had a problem with the service -- they're very friendly and efficient but they don't fall all over themselves for you either, which is fine with me.  I believe it's a family run operation, so keep that in mind.  \n\nIt's not a high-end place, but if you're after good Thai food you won't go wrong here.

<review>Blink and you might miss where Matt's Big Breakfast is located. But don't let the small size of this breakfast hot spot fool you, nor let the long wait deter you. Matt's had been right around the corner from me, and I had no idea until today what I had been missing out on. A group of friends and I all sprung for the daily special of scrambled eggs incorporated with hot links, white cheese, and peppers paired with delicious home fries. So while the wait, especially during a blustery summer day in Phoenix may make you want to stray, don't, and you will be in for a treat!

<review>Nutella frozen yogurt. That is pretty much all I have to say about Twirl. I love frozen yogurt, but I'm first to admit that most frozen yogurt tastes about the same. However, this is not the case for Twirl's. The Nutella is creamy, it's chocolatey and it's completely delicious with every spoonful! They have a wide variety of flavors that are both fruity and creamy. In addition, they have several toppings to top off a delicious cup of fro yo! They have everything from caramel and chocolate sauce, to mochi and fruity pebbles. Twirl is the ultimate shop for a tasty sweet treat to get you through the day!
</review>
<review>Excellent customer service mixed with amazing clothes!  \n\nI love it when I go shopping and the owner of the store assists you with a smile, let's you shop without hovering over you and makes excellent recommendations that you missed!!\n\nI found so many cute clothes - - it was hard to restrain myself from spending all my money!!  Items are moderately priced but worth it when you consider you are supporting a local entrepreneur and the independent, local designers that sell their clothes there on consignment.  \n\nI'll definitely be back soon!  I hope they still have this cute jacket I didn't buy . . .yikes!

<review>If I could give a place 6/5 stars, that would be this restaurant.\nYou know those times when you want take out and you want Chinese food but you could be swayed towards sushi, or even maybe even Hawaiian? Go to this place and just stare are the MANY menu boards. It's all good. I've had their sushi (Tiger roll is my current favorite here), their chinese combo lunch plates (which are outrageously cheap), and their fried fish hawaiian combos. Everything has been great and way more food than I can eat.\n\nTheir service is great as well. They bring the food to your table if you are eating in and start you off with crispy wonton strips and sweet  and  sour sauce. Then your food comes, fresh from their grill, and it is just wonderful. They even offer to top off your drinks for you, and bring you anything else you need.\n\nYou could come here for lunch every day, try something new, and never run out of choices or variety. On top of that, their hours are amazing, something like 10:30 AM to 8PM. Early lunches to late dinners, and they deliver.\n\nI can't think of anything to complain about. Maybe they could offer soup. Really. That's my wish, not even a complaint, because I probably could not eat wontons, soup, AND a dish. But I would try.\n\n--- UPDATE - They DO have soup. It's not on their big boards but is listed on their small takeout menus. So, there you have it. It's all good!

<review>Holy shit!  CUTE WAITER.  We found this place off the beaten path near the Legacy Resort and Spa where we stayed last night and if you're ever in the Tempe area, this is definitely a nice five star place prepped to impress...  and the help is HOT.  \n\nIt's a wine bar and restaurant that is set up in a beautiful converted home space that still has it's homeyness intact to the tea!  Good wine, but for a wine bar, a little sparing...  We had fun!   There was live music, great lighting, did I mention the hot waiter?, and an overall nice atmosphere (ie, hot waiter)!    The menu looked spectacular, but as you've probably figured out by  now, I was there for the vino and the view.
</review>
<review>Pretty good! They have many vegan options if you ask! Waitstaff is friendly. My friend ordered the chicken marsala, but said there was too much fat on it. I ordered the garlic noodle dish, minus the shrimp. Even the half-order at $5 was too generous a helping, but sooo very good. There were approximately 15 other people at our table, as it was a friend's birthday dinner, and everything looked phenomenal, really. I'd definitely like to go back often if I wasn't so distant from chandler!

<review>I just read that Verde is closing tonight, I hope to hell that is just bad info.\n\nI LOVE this place, it is SOOOOO good. \n\nIf great food could marry great service, then have a child called great location- this would be it.\n\nSimple, tasty food, with AMAZING tortillas and they have the BEST classic guacamole in town. Very large portion which doesn't try and break the bank. Best of all, they are awesome in not loading up the guac with tomatoes and other fillers, so they can use less avocados (yes Baja Fresh, I am looking right at you)\n\nPair your meal with a 500ml bottle of Mexican Coke (think Santa, not Scarface) and you have a great meal.\n\nPlease let the rumors of Verde closing be terrible lies told my evil people!
</review>
<review>We went here last night on our way home.  I love that they are open late as we didn't get there till after 10 pm.  If you go earlier, be prepared for a long line/wait.  The food here is always consistently good.  B/F loves the Chimayo Chicken with their fabulous Green Chili Potato.  Last night he had the roasted corn for the side which was amazing.  I got one of their specials - Swordfish with an fantastic pineapple cilantro salad and my sides were the GCP and zucchini.  Excellent meal all around.  My only complaint is, I wish they would get rid of the tv's or make it in a section that is away from the dining area.
</review>
<review>"""Yet another priceline find.  I got a double room for $50/night and surprisingly, was NOT charged the resort fee.  The front staff is friendly and efficient, the grounds are nicely maintained, and the location is great.  My room was neat and clean, which is really all I care about.  The decor is definitely outdated, but not offensively so (i.e., no garish flower prints or tacky Southwest knickknacks).  I was pleasantly surprised by the almost-new cardio machines in the fitness room!  (The fancy modern cardio machines generally let you enter in your weight for a more \honest\"""" calorie burn.  These machines didn't, but I still got a decent workout.)  The fitness room features a few wall-mounted tv's, a separate weight area, his and her changerooms with a shower, and a staff person to answer any questions about the machines/resort/etc.\n\nI like this area and I come to PHX/Scottsdale often enough that I would consider staying here again."""""""

<review>"""CUPCAKE REVIEW-- I love cupcakes, I love Red Velvet, and I am SO glad I found this bakery when I visited Phoenix! I have a passion for great bakeries (mainly cupcakes) and I convince my bf when we are out of town that we have to \try the local flavor\"""" (which means cupcake searching). I bought 4 cupcakes--2 Red Velvet and 2 Ooey Gooey. We took them back to my friend's house and I ate the best red velvet cupcake I have had in awhile. The Ooey Gooey was good as well, but couldn't measure up to the Red Velvet which is my favorite cake anyways. I live in California and have tried them all--Sprinkles included and I *wish*wish*wish* we had a Tammie Coe here. (I even have checked out there site to see about shipping but I don't know if they would be as good as they are fresh) The going rate for a good cupcake is $3-4 anywhere, which these little jewels were priced at so enjoy Phoenix! And Tammie Coe Cakes are welcome anytime here is San Diego!"""""""

<review>"""When I first heard about Lobby's via Twitter my first reaction was \So Tempe's jumping in on the gourmet burger trend.\"""" I guess I should have known this is not the city for $12 burgs.\n\nLobby's serves up one of the best, most satisfying burgers I've tasted this side of the Rio Salado - and it comes with a soda and fries for just under $10. I don't know what Lobby puts in that meat. It tastes fantastic - especially with the Lobby Sauce - and fills you up. But even better, I'm never that \""""why did I eat the whole thing\"""" stuffed when I finish.\n\nLobby's is conveniently close to my house for those random burger cravings. Did I say convenient.

<review>Have you ever gotten an orgasm from peanuts?  No?  Well, I just did.\nNumber 27.  Medium hot.  Went with Robert M  and  Bacon for dinner tonight and we each got a dish to share.  Started with the fried tofu.  Bland.  the sauces were watery.  Also got shrimp rolls.  Yummy.\nIn all, we had a red curry (#26) which was good, but it seemed as if the green beans had been frozen then cooked.  Also, the #34, medium spicy.  Had a peanut taste, a little sweet.  And then: #27.  (angels singing) Now, I don't know the names of any dishes.  I always order by number.  When it came to the table, I drooled all over my white shirt.  And, well, something else in my white panties.  Amazing!\nService was quick and friendly.  I love that it's RIGHT ON McDowell.  Tables face the street, which you don't get very often here in the PHX.\nMy leftovers are in the fridge.  Since I'm single and need the *ahem* effects of #27, I'll be having it before bed.  As a snack.  To get ready for bed.  #27.  Marry me.  I'll be the first person to marry a number.

<review>We came down from Prescott for the weekend to visit the folks If you are looking for great frozen yogurt you will want to try this place. It is located at Dana Park on the NW corner of Baseline and Val Vista Dr.  It feels like it is in Gilbert, but actually a Mesa address. \nThe location isn't really very handy though. The shop it tucked deep in the corner of the plaza and would be easy to miss if you are just driving around.\n  \nThey have a good selection of flavors to choose from. I think you will enjoy the visit. We also found the Ocean Blue at Chandler Mall.
</review>
<review>This place is definitely worth the long trek out to Gilbert.  It's some sort of retro farm house planted in the midst of beautiful scenery... you won't miss it.\n\nAhi Tuna Burger is heavenly.  Juicy seared Ahi tuna served on a bun w/ crunchy cabbage mix and a side of wasabi mayo?  Count me in.  Serious.  I always get the sweet potato fries because they are some sort of perfection.  This place serves the freshest food I have ever seen.  I guess the farm part helps?\n\nI would count this place down because there are usually so many loose children conquering the beautiful grounds while parents mindlessly chat amongst themselves but... I'm not that heartless.  It's usually always clean, the misters keep you cool  and  the heaters keep you warm.  This place is good for everyone... just beware of Chandler/Gilbert moms  and  dads who think farm grill is code for playground.
</review>
<review>(I would give them a 5, but they are new and need some time before they rate a 5.)\n\nMy husband is from Greece, well Crete, actually.  We stumbled on this place on the way home one day and thank goodness we did!  We didn't get a chance to eat in the deli (although the owner kept bringing us samples to try), but we did shop in the market.  It is a very new store, so the shelves aren't full yet, they're trying to figure out what the customers want.  We felt the selection was very good--canned goods, dried beans, fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen meats, and of course olives and feta and desserts.  The prices are very reasonable.  My husband says they're better than anywhere he's seen. \n\nWe got a leg of lamb and it was the most tasty lamb I've had in a long time.  I'm a fan of sheep feta, whether French or Bulgarian.  I think we got the Bulgarian this time.  Everything we got (except the Baklava-type desserts, I wasn't so crazy about them, and I love dessert!!)  The owner let us try their hummus, tabouli, and falafal -- all were fantastic!!\n\nThe owner even showed us his catalog and said he would special order anything we wanted!  Super friendly, clean, good menu in the cafe, can't wait to try it!  This is a fantastic jewel of a place on Pinnacle Peak  and  19th Ave, just south of Norterra.
</review>
<review>I've been here twice so far, both times for dim sum, and both times I've gone home happy, visions of pork buns dancing in my head. \n\nI'm glad that my first trip was with a regular, or I wouldn't have known what to order. In fact, my only complaint is that the servers offer only a breif description, and there is no printout with what is offered on each cart. Other than that it's a fun and inexpensive way for you and your friends to try something new.
</review>
<review>Wanna swirl it?\n\nThis place has delicious frozen yogurt.  My daughter told us about it and we went over here one weekend for an after-lunch sweet.  Get your yogurt cup, go to the dispensers, and serve yourself.  You can get a single flavor, or swirl two together.  Then, you can top it off with candies, nuts, or even fruit before checkout.  My one caveat--they charge by weight, so fill your cups with caution.\n\nGet it to go, sit on one of their chairs and eat in, or pull up to one of their iPad stations and have fun with your froyo.  Any way you do it, Swirl It is a winner.
</review>
<review>The name of the place is Rocket Burgers, yet somehow I got a sub. And let me tell you it was so dang delish!! It was the New Yorker loaded with Pastrami with homemade cole slaw swiss cheese and rocket burgers own sauce. OOOHHHH dang!! So delish!! I love a good pastrami sammie!  Their fries are delish as well.  But this place has over 300 different types of sodas, and even carries Dublin Dr Pepper, you might get a little over whelm on which soda to choose from but it's interesting to see the different types from all over. I settled on a frosty vanilla root beer and was not disappointed. Can't wait to come back and try out other sandwiches and burgers!
</review>
<review>This HD is very good.  They seem to have knowledgeable people.  When I was putting in my irrigation system a while back I got a lot of good info from their plumbing guy.  Apparently he was a master plumber.\n\nOn this trip I needed a overheat sensor for a can light.  The lighting guy had a can he said he couldn't sell because it was missing something, and proceeded to rip the sensor out for me.  No charge.  That's customer service!

<review>Great trail for running as the path is smooth and the incline isn't too ridiculous.  The path is 1.75 miles one-way and is a fun run to change up your normal routine.    The scenery is great with views over the beautiful homes of scottsdale and the other rock formations surrounding the Phoenix area.  There are plenty of other runners on this trail and it is just wide enough to be able to pass other people enjoying the trail.  The bottom of the trail has a bathroom, water, and a shaded pavillion as well.\n\nOverall:\nGood hiking trail with nice views\nGreat trail for running

<review>I've traveled to Phoenix several times for business trips and stayed at the Ritz. True Foods was my go to spot in Phoenix because it was right across the street from the hotel. I love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food. My favorite dishes are the Edamame Dumplings and the Miso Glazed Black Cod. It was often hard to get out of work for lunch, so coming to True Foods at the end of the day was always a treat. \n\nI only wish they had one in San Francisco!
</review>
<review>Stopped in here to meet with family yesterday.  the crew was friendly and was wonderful to everyone (they even took the time to walk an injured gentleman to their car after he finished).  Then there is the food their burgers were fresh and delicious and not too greasy their Italian beef sandwiches were met with fanfare as well.\n\nAlso they have a challenge for those who are really hungry if you dare, I believe it was an over 3lb burger, almost a Man vs. Food challenge :-)
</review>
<review>This place is awesome! I take all of my out of state friends and relatives here when they visit. A must see! This place is cozy, and friendly. The staff is wonderful and the food is great! The food is like your grandma's home made dinners. It is lovely! You get so much for such a great price as well. The bears are super cute. It feels like home here. There may be a lot of people eating but the way it's set up it doesn't get loud so its nice. If you haven't eaten here yet, you are missing out!

<review>Move over Maizie's you've been replaced...for brunch that is. I have a tradition with a lucky few of at least once a weekend going to Maizie's for their brunch and getting smashed. Oh, and we eat a little too.\n\nEverything changed this weekend though when we went to Postino on Central for their brunch debut. The food was so ridiculous good, that we actually forgot to drink. Did you hear me?? FORGOT TO DRINK!!\n\nSince it was our first time there, we ordered a variety of options. I had the Country Toast, which was toasted MJ Bread, topped with Italian Ham, Gruyere Cheese, and a sunny-side up egg. Ho-ly shit. Each bite became increasingly better than the last. It was the perfect bite over and over and over again. The ham had a nice little spice to it, the gruyere cheese had an intoxicating tang to it, the egg was, well, an egg, and the toast really brought it all together incredibly. And it was huge. I barely got through half if it before I had to give up.\n\nMy brunch date got Postino's take on French Toast. To be honest, I am not huge on sweets first thing in the morning, however I would have bathed in this french toast. It was creamy, not overly sweet, and literally melted in my mouth.\n\nI ordered a White Peach Bellini at the beginning of our meal per norm and while it was spectacular with actual peach puree in the bottom of my champagne flute, I completely ignored it after the first bite of my meal. Me. Ignoring anything in a champagne flute. I know.\n\nI feel a bit like the blase housewife who just cheated on her husband for the first time with the pool boy, but I'm sorry Maizie's, consider me shacked up with said pool boy every weekend in the early hours from here on out!

<review>I've been to District a few times over the past couple of months while working on a project in Phoenix.  This is NOT a hotel restaurant by any stretch.  I've eaten in tons of hotels before and this is leaps and bounds above.  From the local draft beers, to the great menu and original entrees, to ending with flavored cotton candy, it has never disappointed.  Nice bar area and the restaurant seating ambiance is ok.  You won't be disappointed.  Recommend the 3rd st Salad and the Organic Salmon.
</review>
<review>This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant anywhere!   The food is incredible as is the atmosphere!  The service is also top notch!  I highly recommend their Pad Thai and Tropical Pineapple, but everything I've tried from here has been very memorable!  The portions are large too, which is good since you won't want to put your fork down!  Just beware, once you try Malee's you will start to crave it ALL the time - it's that yummy.  Woohoo! As good as it gets!

<review>"""After writing my initial review, I was contacted by the manager of Fresh Wasabi (Billy). He asked that I come back in and order the same thing I ordered on my last visit. He explained that he would cover the bill, and that he wanted prove that the first bad experience was not the normal experience a customer would have. I took him up on his offer last night. I went in and ordered to the best of memory, what we had ordered on our last visit. I ordered 2 pieces of nigiri, a california roll, and their \Snow White\"""" Roll. After I ordering I remembered exactly what I disliked on my first visit. Originally the size of the piece of fish on top of the nigiri was quite small. This time, however, if anything, the piece of fish was too big (a good problem to have in my opinion). Next came the california roll. It is a standard california roll, nothing to complain about, very average. The snow white roll is basically a spicy tuna roll topped with a small piece of white tuna and roe with a mustard soy sauce. I didn't care for this roll very much, but it was executed well. I remembered it from the first visit, and I was just not a huge fan of the flavor combination. Finally as an addendum to our order. Billy had us try a new roll. It contained a fried jalepeno and crab in the middle and was topped with siracha and a wasabi mayo. When I read the description, I was thinking it was going to be very spicy. I did not find it extremely spicy though. I found it a little more appealing than the \""""Snow White\"""" roll. It had a similar taste to biting into deconstructed burger (Siracha = Ketchup, wasabi mayo = mayo, rice = bun, crab = meat). Overall, I will probably end up coming back in to the restaurant. I will most likely avoid the specialty rolls as I didn't particularly care for either of them and they are normally $10+ on the menu. However, I would probably sit at the sushi bar and order nigiri and the more basic rolls after explaining to the sushi chef that I prefer big cuts of fish on my nigiri. Billy went over and above to show that my first experience was not the norm and I appreciate the pride he showed in his restaurant. I would come back for lunch and for a staff that takes pleasing the customer seriously."""""""

She's a doll but she might kick your ass. \For sure!\""""\n\nWe started with the spaghetti calzone. Yeah, you heard me. They take spaghetti and they stuff it in a calzone. In. A. Cal. Zone. It reminded me of when I was a kind and we would make spaghetti sandwiches. No, I'm not kidding about that. It was delicious and I have dreams about it. They have those really thin metal forks that only pizza places have and mine kept bending the dough was so nice and thick and good. \n\nThe sauce for the pizza and the calzone is a happy thing. Tangy but sweet, as well. I could eat with we a well bent spoon. The pizza was good but we only got a small due to the calzone. Next time, I want to go with more people and get a bigger one so I can love on the cheese and toppings.\n\nLastly, the sodas come with that really awesome crushed ice that looks like jagged little pellets. To me, that's a clear sign you're in a good pizza joint."""""""

<review>This place is great!  So happy to have a solid grocery store and chaat place in Central Phoenix.  Good chaat, mithai (sweets), and other delights.  Usually fresh jalebis too :).  For Diwali they had really nice milk sweet mithais that tasted homemade to me.  The thalis are great; especially the chicken tikka one.   I haven't tried the pizza, but it sounds good.  The vegetarian thali/meal selection is decent but not quite as good as Little India.  The grocery store is small but they have the necessities: spices, dhals, rice, attas, frozen foods, namkeens, Indian beauty supplies, etc.  The folks who work here are nice and helpful in finding grocery items.  Best part: when I was there today I saw some buffet equipment and when I inquired I was told they are going to open a full restaurant in the back!  Woo hoo can't wait!!!

<review>Best steak money can buy within the 20-Mile radius of its location.  \n\nBeen there multiple times and the quality and the taste have been excellent each and every time.  Since ocean club is also in town, providing good quality and fresh sea food has always been one of their top qualities. I do recommend a sea food tower,  and a lobster mashed potatoes for every dine.\n\nIt's well decorated and the lighting has been set for the atmosphere and the crowd.  If you sit at the bar area, holding a conversation can become challenging at times.\n\nService has plenty of room for improvement;  Warmer staff will definitely help this manner; I do understand a few minutes of wait before getting seated, but every time has been at least 15-25minutes which  becomes very slightly annoying at times, but it will give you an excellent opportunity to have a drink or two at the bar and try one or couple of their Mojitos which are excellent while waiting;\nStaff members  are very knowledgable.\n\nOverall, when you desire a good steak for dinner, or a place to start off your night, this place could be an option.\n\nThis place will get 5 stars for where it's located;

<review>"""My friends and I discovered the Clarendon this summer after hearing that their amazing pool is open for the public to enjoy. After just one lazy Sunday, we were hooked. The pool is fantastic! You can enjoy the appropriately named \Oasis\"""" relaxing on their lounge chairs and couches, or get there early if you want to commandeer one of the beds.  The folks at the Clarendon didn't miss much: the d\u00e9cor is modern and the atmosphere relaxed. They've usually got a pretty good soundtrack piped in above and an even better one below the surface thanks to the nifty underwater speakers (We've caught the themes to Hawaii Five-O, The Love Boat, and even Jaws). Plus there are free towels, pool toys, beach balls, and a very convenient poolside bar (or friendly waiter on slower weekends). Speaking of the bar, do yourself a favor and order a margarita. Better yet - a pitcher of margaritas. Mmm. The only thing they could improve would be the hot tub - although it can fit 50 people (yes, we've tested it) they keep the temperature set to lukewarm bath.  \n\nNeedless to say, we began to panic as the weather started to turn cooler and we foresaw our pool fun coming to an end. Much to our delight, we found the rooftop lounge opening up for the fall season. Although this is more of a work in progress, the potential is there for an excellent night on (or above) the town - you can't beat the view. You never really know what you're going to get at the C though - We've been there on nights when we were the only patrons and others when we couldn't even get upstairs.  For those of you that previously noted the capacity limitations don't worry! We're told that renovations are planned to raise the railings (and thus increase the capacity). Keep your eye on this place!\n\nOh, and if you've got a good excuse to be downtown, you might as well book a room. On slow weekends, they'll give you a great deal and the staff there is very accommodating. The room we got was totally refurbished, clean, and comfortable."""""""
</review>
<review>I'll be honest, the food was so good I ate here twice in one day. Very simple, clean, but elegant pairings with the freshest ingredients around. I had the edamame dumplings and the farmer's market salad for lunch. The dumplings were more like ravioli with a bit of truffle oil - some of the best I've had. I really would have been happy with an entire plate of these for my meal! The salad was fresh and crisp, and an interesting combination of ingredients - golden beets, kale, romaine, manchego cheese, avocado, with a light champagne vinagerette. \n\nLater, I ordered the thai dumplings and steelhead salmon for dinner. The dumplings were good, but not as good as the edamame dumplings from lunch. The salmon was cooked perfectly - good sear on the outside, and moist on the inside - all on top of a bed of beets, greens, and red quinoa. \n\nPrice is a bit of a drawback here, but I suppose you pay for what you get when it comes to the calibur of the ingredients. I don't live in AZ, but a True Food just opened in Denver where I live - can't wait to get back here.
</review>
<review>Consistently good food!  Good iced tea.  Cooked in front of you if seated at the bar.  The beef tenderloin quesadilla is unreal.  A little pricy, but worth it.  The salsa (red) is perfect to me with a unique tang.  This is good food.  I see the same staff there for years, this tells me something about the owner-must be a decent guy.  Very charming and unique setting.  Next time you check it out, if you can find it, ask about why the shower is in the Bathroom!  I kind of hope you dont find it so all the good stuff is left for me!

<review>"""Add mine to the list of 'damn, the food is good here' [as long as you order the right thing] and the guacamole is delish. Add also that the service - yeah, you Dario - was bogus. Guac order came with the entrees, side salad for one of the three of us never delivered or acknowledged as missing, and generally a sense that he was doing us a favor coming to work today. Neat. \n\nOn food grounds alone its very fine. I had the langostine quesadilla and it was delish: a nice chunk of lobster on each [and there are four 4\ tortillas/quesadillas], in a sweet sauce that was perfectly countered by goat cheese. I tasted the fish tacos - also seemed perfectly matched: the slight heat of the baja sauce, perfectly cooked fish [lightly battered and not at all heavy or greasy]and cabbage...nice. I didn't try the mole but the report was bland. We all loved the guac and the chips. [Two of us had soda, one an iced tea - bill came to $72 before tip for three of us.]\n\nBe warned, this is not a quiet place. Even two-thirds full at lunch, its loud. I could see bringing friends and drinking margaritas, and having the noise just be part of the enjoyment. Now if only Dario would stay home..."""""""

<review>Like a lot of other people, I went for a one month stint  (*cough* groupon *cough*). Most amazing yoga experience of my life. If I had the dough and lived closer to this amazing little nirvana-esque studio, this would be my place. Some studios get too corny with their faux new-agey vibe....but here I feel like the vibe and ' heart' is organic and unforced.  Brooke the owner is an AMAZING instructor. She provides useful information about the transformative effects of each pose and it pushes me to complete each section with dignity, grace, willpower and determination like no other. I've never advanced so rapidly (in as short as four sessions) both mentally and physically. I also went during August  and it helped me tolerate the insane mind melting heat with more aplomb than in past summers. You know they say that once you go Bikram, you never go back-ram ( I know that was corny with a 'k'). But seriously try it.

<review>"""One of the guys down at Cycle Gear in Mesa had recommended this bar to me several weeks ago, he gave me the impression that it was a motorcycle bar of sorts, so I hopped on my bike to check it out last Friday night around 11pm.\n\nFirst timers take note:  This place is to easy to zip past, esp. if you're looking for it westbound off of Thomas.  Print a map or at least know the cross street name, N 68th street.\n\nAnyway, when I finally found the place and pulled into the parking lot, there was not another motorcycle in sight.  So much for it being a motorcycle bar, maybe that's on certain nights.\n\nWhen I stepped inside and looked around, half the (mostly female) contingent of people at the actual bar turned around and stared, I guess a motorcycle riding man is somewhat of a novelty?  I found a seat at the back side of the horseshoe bar, noticed that Guiness was on tap, so I ordered a black and tan for $4.50.  I immediately started chatting with a friendly tatooed local next to me, Megan.  \n\nWe talked about restoring motorcycles  and  cars, and how she got into working as a female bouncer.  She told me a story of some poor guy who's forehead was actually cracked open against the wall \on accident\"""" while she was trying to haul him out of the bar in a headlock.  That conversation ended within approx 30 seconds of me casually mentioning the fact that I had a girlfriend.   Which was OK because they had \""""The Big Lebowski\"""" playing on a couple of flat screens in close captioning, and I fuckin' love that movie.\n\nInside the TT Roadhouse there is a lot of wood, as is cellulose.  It is pretty small, and reminded me of another tiny bar, the Tiki Ti in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.  Only with more of a pirate/twin peaks feel.   I also noticed that there were in fact, several old timey pictures of motorcycles on the walls, hooray, I guess that makes it a motorcycle bar after all. \n\nFor my second drink I asked the other bartender (i.e. not \""""The Predator\"""") what he recommended from the tiki style Friday night $3 drink specials.  He was kind of an ass about it, saying \""""I don't recommend any of them....because I'm a guy\"""", or some shit like that.  I let it slide and just ordered a Pabst Blue Ribbon in a can for $2.  \n\nThe bar wasn't ever packed, about 2/3 full when I got there, but more people started rolling in past midnight.  The ratio was easily half male/female. If you were looking for a hookup, there were maybe 2 or 3 \""""doable\"""" girls there, tops.\n\nThe men's room was flooded, the urinal looked like it hadn't been flushed in the past 30 uses, and the toilet was clogged too.  I even tried to unclog it using the plunger there, but no dice.  I hate having to take a piss is some unflushed toilet and have the pisswater spray back at me, fuckin gross.  The only good thing is that they had soap and water and paper towels to wash up with.  \n\nWhen I finished washing up and looked in the mirror I noticed that I had been wearing my reflective Halo band around my neck since I walked in the bar.  (The Halo is this reflective band you put around your helmet so drivers can see you at night.)  Man did I feel like a toolbox.  Is that why everybody was looking at me like that when I walked in?  Maybe they're wondering, \""""Is some kind of trendy new scarf, no wait, wtf is that guy wearing around his neck?!\"""".   Nobody had said anything the previous 20 minutes, including the girl I had been talking to, maybe they were too loaded to care, or just trying to be polite.\n \nWhile saddling up on my bike outside, a girl on the, ah, \""""tipsy\"""" side was pushed over to me by her gay manfriend, whereupon I was solicited for a ride.   She said she really wanted a ride despite the fact that she had never ridden on a motorcycle before.  I tried to explain that:  buzzed driver + drunk 1st time passenger + no passenger helmet = almost certain disaster, but I'm not sure if it really registered.  Her friend announced \""""wait, wait let's get a look at his asssss when he gets on the bike\""""   I happily obliged and took off into the night."""""""

<review>Solo Cafe is definitely one of the premier coffeehouses in the Phoenix area. They make excellent coffee drinks from Ron Cortez-roasted beans and all of their tea and pastries are from local businesses as well.\n\nThe ambiance at Solo can best be described as upscale eclectic. It definitely isn't pretentious, but it isn't the typical bohemian coffeehouse feel. The owners of Solo just completed a minor facelift of the shop, changing out some of the art and rearranging the interior. On the back wall, they added a large mural which features the Solo Cafe name. Also, they're in the process of adding a kitchen so that they can offer a wider selection of food, which I think will serve to make this awesome coffeehouse even better.\n\nSolo Cafe is a gem among the Phoenix coffee scene and it's great to see a local business thriving.

<review>Only had the lunch special (2 slices and a drink).  Had it a few times and it's a great value and a decent slice of pizza.  They don't skimp on the toppings either.\n\nI used to eat at Lucky's in North Peoria all the time and this place really reminds me them.  Thin crispy crust with a nice amount of crunch and chew.  Nothing like the pre-made garbage you get at the chains.  You can tell this dough is made fresh.\n\nDon't expect high end fixtures or fancy toppings, just good basic pizza at a good price.
</review>
<review>I frequent this place at least once a week to enjoy the wonderful affordable AND low cal fro yo at Golden Spoon. I LOVE this place. They have all the standard toppings and even carry seasonal flavors like Pumpkin (my personal favorite). The fro yo does come out soft, so I sometimes take it home and freeze it so it gets icey. All this considered, it still deserves five stars. \n\nHow can it be that we live in the scorching hot desert and there is only a handful of fro yo possibilities in the area? Of all the strip malls full of nail spas, tanning salons and every random franchised experience under the sun, why are there only a few jumping on the fro yo lovin train?

<review>I like Mexican food and this place did not disappoint! My family and I were in Phoenix for only a few hours and my husband's cousin suggested coming here for dinner. The outside wall art was an added bonus. Best dinner suggestion ever! Although there was not a 'kid's menu' and hardly any food to choose from, we were able to get my daughter a few corn tortillas and chicken to make her own version. Problem solved. Our meals were fantastic and the sangria was the best I'd ever had!
</review>
<review>This place is amazing. cheap but great food and really nice staff.  the place has a great atmosphere with old Chicago stuff.  Their hot dogs are great. I personally love the chili dog.  The sliders are great too and  the french fries are the type that are amazing when warm but are still amazing when there cold.  You can also get authentic cheese fries, which accordingly to my girlfriend (a Chicago native) is nearly impossible in Phoenix. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. We go to it at least 3 times a month.
</review>
<review>I have been taking my son here for 7 years now. The entire staff is always attentive, they typically have appointments available when you call and your child is sick and their physicals have always been very thorough.\n\nI love they have two sides to the their office - sick door and healthy door. They also have Saturday hours at their other location, so that is useful if you need them. \n\nThey do a lot of newborn/new parent education. \n\nThe doctors and staff are always friendly, they truly do like what they do and they do a great job.
</review>
<review>My beloved boyfriend had suggested this place one night for dinner and I love trying new things. The ambiance is dark but lit with many candles and chandeliers to enduce a sense of culinary romance. The mosaic brick-tiled wall accent is a nice touch as well. The staff seemed knowledgeable but a bit robotic for my taste. To start, we ordered a bottle of the El Coto Rioja Crianza 2007. We then moved on to the tableside mixed guacamole which is yummy but probably worth your calories for the whole week! The salsa they give you with the chips was super disappointing. I felt like we were dipping our chips into a bowl of cheap store bought watered down tomato sauce. Our appetizer we shared was the Colorado lamb with the rice and lamb chirizo. It was very impressive in presenation and flavor profile. I was blown away that I felt maybe we shouldn't have gotten an entree and just had more of the lamb. Our entree that we shared was the Chirizo Porchetta (pork shoulder, chorizo, fresh rosemary, cotija, white bean puree, sweet garlic crema w/chirizo gastrique). It was pretty tasty, however, we both agreed that the pork was a bit dry.\n\nTo summarize, atmosphere is a 5, cleanliness 5, food/wine 4, service 3/4 and yes I would recommend this place to others.

<review>Even though I live closer to a different Asian market, I take the time to drive a little further for the great selection and prices at Lee Lee.  They have just about anything you would need to make any Asian or Asian-inspired dish.  And it's not just strictly Asian food.  They have aisles for Indian products, European and British products, and Hispanic products, among others.\n\nThere is so much to find here. A decent produce section caters mostly to those looking for Asian vegetables.  The bakery aisle is stocked with an assortment of trucked-in (not made in-house) breads and a few sweets.  At the back of the store you can find a seafood counter and meat section that has both fresh and frozen meats.  Again, I cannot emphasize enough how reasonable most of the prices are!  On the other side of the store is huge freezer section full of items too numerable to list.  In the center you can find aisles full of kitchen gadgets, pots, pans, steamers, dishes, and even a beer/liquor section.  A small restaurant and snack counter are located near the entrance of the store, but I have yet to try either of them.\n\nThis is just a great overall Asian market.  I can easily spend over an hour just browsing the aisles.  So glad I found this place!

<review>What I like about Windsor is its unpretentious style. At the same time it has a great style, great decor for a small neighborhood restaurant. I like that they have smaller portions (right portions.. don't be afraid you will leave hungry). Patio is nice and interior is connected with Churn- a place where you get your cookies, ice cream and some fun stuff. I really like the bar area. It is large and old fashion in the good sense of the word. what I would like to see at Windsor is seasonal menu. changing 4 times a year. After eating there 10 times you kind of run out of options.

<review>The Vig was great!  We ordered the following-\nApps:\nChips and Guac-- YUM, good chips\nSweet Potato Fries-- good but not great\nSpinach Dip- v. good\n\nVig-azz burger-- it was big and it was good.  \nPasta Special-- delish\n\nCheesecake-- excellent\n\nThe parking was a bit nightmarish but whatever, I am downtown a lot so I am used to it by now.  It's valet ($3) or you have to park across the street on the west side of the Checks Cashed joint. \n\nLots of cocktails-- everyone seemed to enjoy them all.  We were a group of 5 and the booth was perfect.  The setting was chill, just a really good experience.  I am looking forward to my next night out at The Vig!
</review>
<review>Went back to Hula's for a little pre-bday brunch with some family.  6 of us left trashed and full of delicious food for less than 150 bucks.  I'm not talking about lightweights either. We had a pretty serious collection of empty glasses goin on.  The pork hash was delicious.  Eggs came out a little less runny than I would like and they rushed back to grab me some new ones without making me feel like a d-bag.  Hula's is quickly becoming a regular spot for me.
</review>
<review>I got two pieces of chicken, mac and cheese, and refried beans with a Coke for under $7.  The chicken was very good tasting, juicy and cooked just right.  The mac and cheese was delicious.  I got this order to go and they had me sit down at a table and the waitress brought the check and my drink over.  It was very nice and relaxing after the morning I had.  They have R and B playing and ESPN on the flat screen tv, so I had no problem waiting for my food to cook.  The restaurant is very clean and everyone was very polite!!  Next time I go back, I want something with BBQ sauce, it smells wonderful!
</review>
<review>MMM! Can you say delicious? You actually won't be saying anything because your mouth will be full of Pad Thai and the Coconut Milk Curry soup! This place was introduced to me by a friend who threw her anniversary party here and it was the best place for service!\n\nI absolutely love the Thai Tea and Thai Coffee they serve. It is a definite on the menu of items to try. \n\nI absolutely love the decor. Very ornate and very clean!
</review>
<review>The house beer here... My friend and I dropped in here for our first times and ordered it. The sweet aroma of that brew was hard to pinpoint. I said some sort of berry, he said orange, and our waitress claimed cannabis. From that point on I was sold.\n\nOverall, I like this place. The look and ambience of the Roosevelt with their beer selection and presentation makes for a wholly enjoyable experience. It's definitely worth all the trouble trying to find the place. Depending on how you look at it, the size of this place is either a pro or a con. It's a good thing in that it builds a relaxed and quiet atmosphere, but it might be a negative in the case where the space gets filled easily. The bar is literally a house that they converted which I find cool, but I will admit that some of the rooms give off a claustrophobic feel.\n\nThe Roosevelt definitely is and will be a staple of the burgeoning arts district, so try to go by there before it becomes too well known. Make sure to check out the crazy good berry-citric-weed beer too and keep the secret to yourself.
</review>
<review>So far, I can only review the bar for this place, but that's all one needs to be sold on Haus Murphy's. Virtually anything and everything I could think of was stocked in the dense cabinets, and the tap selection was amazing. Amazing, I tell you! Now, I've never had German beer, but my Dunkel Optimiser hit the spot and packed quite a punch. Would drink again, especially since you can get it as a 32. oz. Are you up to that challenge?\n\nOf course, the overall atmosphere also rocks. I've walked by here a million times and seen the live polka and such. Consider this a place a glimpse of a culture you won't see too often around these parts. Can't wait to tell you about the food!
</review>
<review>"""My boyfriend and I like to come here now just for the dessert.  He's not into paying to cook his own food so the allure of the meal packages doesn't work on him.  But, dessert we will both do, and the Melting Pot is one of our favorite places to do so.\n\nI love the variety that you get with the dessert fondue: cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, cream puffs, strawberries, bananas, multiple types of marshmallows, and pineapples are all cut up into mini pieces perfect for feeding each other behind the closed curtain.  We always choose the turtle (chocolate and caramel with pecan nuts), and request the dark chocolate instead of the milk chocolate for those extra antioxidants.  \n\nWe recently came to the one on Ray Rd for our Anniversary on New Year's and I was especially pleased with the service.  The waiter not only recommended the correct size we would need for the two of us without trying to upsell us and leave us with way too many leftovers, but he also brought us extra pieces of our favorite \bites\"""" when we had finished to make sure we were happy and the extra chocolate didn't go to waste. \n\nI really appreciated the great service and the great food, and for that I say Thank You Melting Pot!"""""""
</review>
<review>Finally, a Southeast Asian food pulse around CenPho. When I first moved here, one of the things I noticed was how few choices there were when it comes to Asian cuisine. So nice to see something a little less common like Cambodian food get represented. \n\nThe spring rolls are a must. For $2, you get a very heavily stuffed roll of rice paper touting chicken, shrimp, cilantro, carrots, etc. The beef salad is also a winner. The seafood soup is flavorful and just might literally nourish the soul. The sandwiches with the pork pate are a great lunch choice. One day, I got one plus a roll to go--all under $6. Of the desserts, everyone should try the sweet and salty corn at least once. The tapioca is my favorite. Light and warm. \n\nThe best part about eating here is knowing that your money is going toward a very genuine and kind Cambodian family. I have spoken with the chef/owner's son every time I go in. A real sweet guy who will demonstrate how to play the xylophone-esque instrument that is the centerpiece of the main dining room. Speaking of, I love all the touches of decor i.e. travel books on Cambodia at every table. \n\nI really, really hope this place does not go the way of some mom-and-pop operations in Phoenix that had really great things to offer. I've been disturbed by the lack of customers I've seen a few times. I want this restaurant to really succeed. I don't want the lines out the door (otherwise I can't get in. ;P) but I want to see a steady stream of patrons. This place really has a chance to be a good-size fish in a big pond. It doesn't fit a cookie-cutter mold and it's got a fantastic bill of fare to show off.

<review>Stayed here on a business trip Mon 7/11 thru Thurs 7/14 and my experience was great! I researched other reviews before I decided on staying at this hotel since it appeared to be a party spot on the weekends. I called to make my reservation (instead of on line) and was assured that it would be quiet during the week. During the first night I heard a few people talking next door but not too late, other than that it was nice and peaceful the entire stay. I had a standard room and it was huge, decorated beautifully and I love the decor. Was looking for a different hotel with some character and this one definitely did not disappoint! I liked that every room has a balcony and a nice comfy lounge chair to enjoy outside. The mini bar was fully stocked. Beds were really comfy, and plenty of space for me to do work in the evenings. My only complaint (which was minor) was that I had a view of the empty dirt lot across the street which wasn't very pretty. It seemed like there weren't very many people staying at the hotel and I would have liked a room with courtyard view but by the time I got settled in my room, didn't feel like being moved. The bar and lounge area is comfy and there were lots of business travelers so it was a great environment. Ate dinner at the bar one night while I watched the baseball all star game on one of the flat screen tv's and food was really good. Service was excellent and staff really friendly. Valets were quick and service was excellent. I never had to wait for than 5 minutes for my car. My only regret is that I didn't have time to use the workout center but looked like nice equipment and it overlooked the pool through big glass windows. Location was excellent for me, it's within minutes of the 101 freeway. \n\nOverall great experience and I am planning to come back to this hotel on vacation with my husband. This is my spot to stay for all my business trips to AZ!
</review>
<review>I give this place 5-stars because not because of yummy food, but because of their CHEESECAKE! But I'll get to that later.\n\nTHE FIRST VISIT: After skimming through a friends photo album on Facebook, I saw that they ate here and I decided to give it a try! I went on a Wednesday afternoon with my boyfriend for some early lunching! \nI ordered the Linguine Frutti de Mare, its light and hits the spot for pasta and seafood! There are like a gazillion baby clams in that dish I swear.\nMy boyfriend ordered a ton of stuff but I don't remember... He throughly enjoyed his meal and said it was the best Italian food outside his mother's cooking! (He also mentioned that he'd never eat at Olive Garden after coming here.)\n\nEven after we were pretty much stuffed and ready to be wheeled out by our soft spoken and chipper waitress, we had to try the cheesecake, because I love cheesecake.\n\nIt arrived, and the first spoonful of the stuff was heavenly, it was rich and almost heavy, but it just ... Melts in your mouth, that it doesn't matter that you're probably gonna weigh six thousand pounds after the meal. It had roasted hazelnuts and raspberry sauce slathered all over it, oh god, I'm probably going to have to go tomorrow... And order TWO slices of cheesecake. Haha!\n\nMy first time here was amazing, our waitress was very attentive and humorous. The second time wasn't so awesome, but I'll cut the waiter that we got some slack because it got really busy really fast compared to the quiet lunch I had the first time. The second time our drinks were empty almost 75% of the time and that's no bueno in my book.\n\nThe only reason I will come back is for the cheesecake. I hope that stays consistent.
</review>
<review>"""To start of the new year, we were in Phoenix. My cousin recommended this place and he was able to make reservations via Open Table for the 6 of us. Our reservations were for 7pm, but they were that packed that we didn't get seated until around 7:30. It's a cozy lil place and when we finally did get seated we sat in the \governor's corner.\""""\n\nThey had a lot of drink specials which I would have loved to try, but I was feeling under the weather. I ended up ordering the Cedar Planked Salmon. I made my husband get the special for the night,  ribeye surf and turf (basically shrimp, sausage and scallops on a stick as the surf part). My salmon was a slightly over cooked and I wasn't a fan of the horseradish potatoes, but I ended up trading the potatoes with my husband's potatoes which were so much better. =) He seemed like he enjoyed his meal and he ended up eating the rest of mine too. (That's what husband's are good for ;)) In any case, I loved the atmosphere and the company. We ended up getting two free desserts with the kitchen being backed up and the wait for the table. We ended up with the croissant bread pudding and the warm chocolate torte. Both were delicious, but the warm chocolate torte was my favorite. \n\nOverall, service was good especially for a busy night and food was decent. I would definitely want to come back to try some drink specials and more desserts. =)"""""""

<review>I'm glad that great customer service can still be experienced at a Nordstrom. Sadly, this one is about 800 miles away from where I live.\n\nI expected the Scottsdale Nordstrom to be as or more upity than my neighboorhood Cherry Creek spot, but was plensantly surprised. The customer service was great, and when my helper had to transfer to a another customer that arrived before me, he made sure that I was covered by someone else. Nice.\n\nWhen I go to Nordstrom, I don't expect great prices, but do expect good quality and great customer service. The Scottsdale employees got it right.
</review>
<review>d'lish is for sure the perfect name for this little place. When you walk in, the atmosphere is great, what with the snazzy furniture, friendly staff, and the plenty of customers in line, eager for the fresh food they serve up. Their menu is expansive and you might feel overwhelmed by all the breakfasts, soups, salads, wraps, sandwiches, are you feeling overwhelmed as I talk about all the choices that will overwhelm you?! Last time I went there, I ordered the nuts n' berries salad, the perfect toss of greens, blueberries, goat cheese, candied walnuts, and a raspberry walnut vinaigrette. It's perfect! I've also had their butternut squash soup, YUM! I try to try something different all the places I eat, and at D'lish, it'll be a while till I run out of new options. Go here!!
</review>
<review>Continue to come here for breakfast, been 8 or 9 times now and it still has yet to fail me. Today I had the santa fe sautee and it was delicioso!! There are so many options on the menu that it is hard to choose from, but I have definitely found 3 favorites on here. The turkey and avocado sandwich was not a fav.. but I'm not much of an avocado fan anyway. I definitely recommend this place to people looking for a good breakfast joint.

<review>So I've been going to this Chino Bandido place off and\non for a number of years. Great concept - Chinese/Mexican\n(Con)fusion without any pretense. At the original location\nby the horsey races they give Chino Bandido virgins the\nwhole flavor sample deal - you almost get a full meal just\ntrying all the different possible fillings. So in this\nChandler location I didn't notice that whole ritual. It\nis more of just figure out what you want and fill out the order\nsheet. \n   The order sheet seems to trip up a lot of folks.\nIt ain't rocket science or quantum finance, folks. Don't\neven look at the sheet. Figure out what you want to eat\nfirst and then look at the sheet (see photo) and figure out \nhow to express that. \n  It's easy. You get 14 items to choose from: Carnitas, Chile\nRelleno, Chinese BBQ Pork, Egg Foo Yung, Gringo Chicken, Hengrenade\nChicken, Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, Jerk Chicken, Emerald\nChicken, Teriyaki Chicken, Veggie Salad, Pollo Diablo, and Machaca.\nGot all that? Now you can choose to get this as a rice bowl, \ncombination, Quesadilla, or Burrito. \n   For the rice bowl, you just choose one item with steamed rice or\noptional beans as well. You can also add fried rice for 75 cents.\n   For the combo, you can choose two different items (it says 1-20 \nbut I think they meant 14) and circle either BLK for Black or REF for \nrefried beans. Then you also choose what type of fried rice you want. \nJFR for Jerk Fried Rice, CFR for Chicken Fried Rice, PKFR for pork \nfried rice, and PLFR for plain fried rice. This is pretty much the \nfull-on big plate. You can also get the items in either a burrito or \na quesadilla by specifying a Q or B. This way you get a burrito or\nquesadilla in addition to your fried rice and beans. \n   You can also get items as Quesadillas. You can mix more than one\nitem together if you're daring. Same with the burritos. \n   You can also order the rice and beans as a separate side if you \ndidn't get the rice bowl or combo and wanted it anyway. You can get\nit as a pint or quart as well if you want to take some home.\n   Finally, the cookies. You get a free cookie anyway but if one ain't\nenough they have a space for you to order half a dozen or a dozen.\n   Drinks - pretty much self explanatory. I like this place. I don't need\nan endorsement by Guy Fieri to justify my liking this place. This is \nan occasional lunch outing with co-workers when the mood strikes. Lately\nI've just been getting Quesadillas and Burritos and skipping the whole\nrice and beans thing. I don't need to fall asleep in any meetings thank\nyou. :) One thing about this location - even though you don't need \nhigher education to fill out the order form you might still need a \nsextant, compass, telescope, and charts to find the place. The Google\nmap makes it look like it is right on Chandler but it's deep southeast \ninto the mall. Lots of parking but not necessarily right next to the\nplace during the lunch rush.
</review>
<review>I really love this place!! Nothinglike a fun Sunday meal with my family to make me love it even more. We stuffed ourselves with delish catfish, fried shrimp , and tasty hazelnut Mahi. Service from Rocky was \nreally fast , effiecient without that fake cloying attitude. Felt like we were\nthe center of the restaurant. Funny how things like fast drink refills, quick service and welltime plate removal can do that.  \nAnd here is the kicker of the evening ..I know have ordered or tasted every dessert on thier dessert tray, scary but true. Did you know that three of their desserts are made fresh there the rest including cheesecakes are made in Texas and brought in. I got the fresh Brulee  . yummy.   Can't wait to go back.
</review>
<review>We went late on a weeknight after having a pretty bad day, so I would like to go back another time to fully enjoy the experience. While sushi certainly didn't fix anything, it did make the day a little better to digest. We weren't overly hungry, so we didn't order too much... but their alcoholic drinks were very delicious! They have some neat mixed drinks to try out, so I want to go back and try some more of them out too! I forget what I had, but it was very tasty and very strong, although I didn't notice how strong it was while I was drinking it! :) The sushi itself was also good, and the miso soup was tasty. It wasn't very busy, but then again it was late on a weeknight. Not sure how busy it gets, but it was a nice relaxed atmosphere when we went. Everyone was very nice, and I feel bad because I was not in the best of moods. They were still super nice to me, though! We will be going back ASAP, for sure... and we will bring friends and family, too!
</review>
<review>The NICEST people work there, always cheerful and sweet, even if they have not slept the night before. :)  5 stars for the service.  Minus one (tiny issue) for the strength of the coffee.  But then again, an extra shot is only $.25 so it's not a big deal.  \n\nIf you are trying to avoid caffeine, their Italian/French Soda is yummy too! Love to mix the strawberry and vanilla + cream. Add some whip cream and hmmm...heavenly (so healthy too...LOL)!
</review>
<review>"""My man had a wild hair to go here tonight and so we went. We both ordered top sirloin, but his came with a bleu cheese butter sauce on top. Mine came with no toppings, and the waitress didn't offer steak sauce. Hmm. Since I like my steak well done, one would surmise that I would probably want something to dip it in or pour over it, n'est-ce pas? But no. We waited for her to come back, he asked her for steak sauce and she comes back and puts it on HIS side of the table. You know, the side with the steak that already has a topping. Uhduh? \n\nAlso, I ordered my steak well done and it was perfect, albeit DRY as there was no sauce and I almost choked on it. But he ordered his medium, and it came out with no pink. Huh?\n\nAll in all, a good deal for the dinners which were around $16 each. Good calamari app. Nom nom. The wine I chose was delicious - a blend, they're usually better. The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy too. This is the 2nd time we've dined here since moving to Phoenix and I still give it a thumbs up. The first time I enjoyed the \Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad\"""" and highly recommend it if you're into that kind of dish. But if you order steak, be careful to order it less done than you really want it. I probably could've played hockey or maybe football with mine. Good gracious.\n\nNo other snafu's tonight, except that the tables outside were a bit too close and as the large party next to us was being seated, my boyfriend had a bunch of butts in his face. Back that ass up, ladies....actually, WE had to push our table away twice. And later a waiter was trying to carry like a million plates away from a table and of course he dropped them and scared us, giving us a few more grey hairs (thanks a lot). This stuff happens and it's like eh, whatever, who cares. But these details do kind of dampen the ambiance. \n\nReally love the large selection of everything! Iron out the deets, BJ's Brewhouse!"""""""

<review>Now I know how non-Asians feel inside Lee Lee's...and the best part?  They sold me pure fat for 0.99cents a lb (best to call ahead, though I caught them in the middle of a butchering and they happen to have a slab handy to chop for me immediately), which is wonderful for adding into your own homemade sausages.  I used to purchase the fat pre-pckgd at Lee Lee's but could no longer find it in the past year, so I am glad to have discovered this place!

<review>It's been over two years since my first review of SMC, I've since bought a new mountain bike from them and have had routine service there - and my review stays at a 5 star without question.\n\nI spent a lot of money there because they take the time to deal with my indecisiveness in dropping $3k. I had other options and I was shopping around including online but my decision came down to them. They're local, they ride the trails I ride, they're extremely experienced and knowledgable and seem to give a shit with my hundreds of questions I had in 26 vs 29, brain vs no brain, chassis geometry, this rear set with that shifter etc... like endless knowledge of everything they stock and more.\n\nIt came down to ordering a brand new 2011 or taking the last 2010 upper model in the shop. After some talking I walked out with the more upgraded 2010 model. I got a great price, had it in-hands and didn't have to wait the 4+ months to get the new one and I was stoked.\n\nRecently I brought her in for routine maintenance, left it there after my ride on a sunday and was back in hands tuesday afternoon. It went in dirty and grimy - came out like a million bucks :) Like seriously as clean as the day I bought it... \n\nAnyways - they care, they have only the best bikes there and evidently the best help, and that is why I spend my money there and recommend them to you.\n\nRide hard kids...

<review>First it was kosher. Then it was kosher-style. Now it's kosher again (and has been for several years.) The recipes never changed - the politics of this silly town did.\n\nAnd all along, it's been my favorite little Jewish bakery in town. Chompies is nothing in comparison!\n\nThe Raspberry Delight cake has been my favorite cake EVER, consistently, for about 20 years. I've even given it as a birthday cake and anniversary cake to loved ones. Don't let the small size fool you - this thing packs a wallop of flavor!\n\nThe breads are always consistently really good. This morning, the Fantastic Mr. It's Complicated and I were in, and he opted for a marble rye. A gorgeous, perfect, deceptively heavy super crusty rye. YUM!\n\nI avoid the butter cookies as much as I can. Mostly because once I eat one, I won't stop until they're all gone. Yes, I have eaten almost a full pound in one day. Not a pretty sight.\n\nAll the other cookies, cakes, mondelbread, hamentaschen, etc. are top notch, too.\n\nSo nice to have a real old school kosher bakery in the hood!

<review>Great store, plenty of parking, and has everything from biking, clothing, kayaking and rock climbing.  I can spend hours looking through the different sections of the store and walking out with new gadgets and boots.  \n\nWhat ever it is that you do in the outdoors, they most likely will have it.  There employees really know what they are talking about, having much experience in the outdoors and the products that they sell.  They got a bike shop inside so they can fix your bike or what ever.  They have classes on GPS, bike care, kayaking and tons of other things during the week and on the weekend.  They have the most recent products there and  much more... they have everything you need for that next trip, hike or ride.

<review>This is the best buffet in Az. HUGE variety from veggie dishes, fish, shrimp, mussels, and even sushi. The quality of food is very good too. One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food, look inside! This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good. Just sayin'. For a buffett, they have a really nice staff. There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing. It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks. I eat here at least once every couple weeks.

<review>The first couple of times I went to Nee House I was unimpressed.  We had ordered typical stuff off their American menu, which was okay but nothing to rave about. Then I dined there with a Chinese friend who ordered off their Chinese menu, and my opinion of Nee House did a 180 degree turn.  If you're ready to be a little adventurous, you're in for a taste treat!  I love their steamed fish, which is slathered in a delicate, flavorful broth.  The Kowloon Crab is a garlicky treat, but wear old clothes when you dig into this sticky hands-on goodie or your next stop might have to be the dry cleaners.  Other favorites are the Szechuan Green Beans and Garlic Eggplant.
</review>
<review>Good sushi + a good price = winner. It's hard to find a decent place for sushi that doesn't cost an arm and a leg...except at dozo. Here you get the best of both. I really like the amount of specialty rolls they have here and the favor combos. The prices for the rolls are great too with the specialty rolls topping out at like $11-12 for 8 rather large pieces and they don't skimp on the fish in them. A good judge is that a  negihama roll had not chopped yellowtail but slices of fish and plenty of scallion for i think $5.\n\nThe only things keeping this place from a 5 star are that it can take awhile to get the food (even when you are the only people there) and some of the rolls aren't wrapped well so it's hard to pick them up with chopsticks. But These are really outweighed by the quality of the fish and the prices.

<review>This is Tempe's greatest kept lunch spot secret.  \n\nThe food is always super fresh and delicious.  The service is awesome and its family owned.  They also use a lot of local fresh food.  For example, they get their hoagies fresh daily from an Italian deli nearby.  And it's some of the best bread I've ever had.\n\nI've tried everything on the menu and I've been a regular for several years.  If I had to recommend one thing on the menu it'd be the Italian Cheesesteak (add mayo, lettuce, tomato to make it 'hoagie style').  They grill that bad boy up fresh every time.  The soups are great too, my favorite is a tie between the Albondigas and Broccoli Cheese.  My wife enjoys the tuna or turkey.  You can't go wrong, check it out!
</review>
<review>First, I did not eat here.  This has nothing to do with the food.\n\nI was in the area and had heard about this place.  Younger crowd (yes, it's close to ASU) but good music, good atmosphere.\n\nStrong pours from the staff.  I mean strong.  I mean five stars strong, on any type of liquor, any bottle.  If you hang out in Scottsdale and need a reprieve from that scene (and that L.A./Vegas price point for drinks), this is a place that should be on your short list.  You will think you died and went to heaven when you get the tab!
</review>
<review>"""I really enjoyed this place.  Made a reservation for 4 and mentioned my wife's birthday.  We were seated promptly and the service from start to finish was very attentive.  We started with the appetizer plate and split a couple of salads.  The appetizer plate consisted of sushi, a shrimp stick, a lobster potsticker, and something else that escapes me.  Very good and the platter for two was split by the four of us.  We had the farm salad whick contained walnuts, different veggies and an outstanding dressing.  Our friends had what was titled I believe \Wowie Shrimp\"""" and they really enjoyed it.  For main courses, I had Mahi Mahi crusted with Macadamai nuts--delicious with a lobster glaze type sauce.  Rich but very good.  My wife and one of our friends had Scallops with basil---excellent dish and huge portion--scallops had a little crust on the outside and very tender on the inside.  Our other friend had Ono (sp.?) and really enjoyed it as well.  We ordered to of their lava cakes for dessert.  They brought out one decorated for my wife's birthday and didn't make the traditional scene that many restaurants do.  They comp'd both desserts which I thought was pretty classy.  All in all a very good experience and certainly worth another visit."""""""

<review>"""We went to the Farm to check out the Farmer's Market and go to lunch.  It was amazing.  I can't believe this is only 15 minutes from my cookie cutter stucco house.  It's almost hard to believe it's even in Phoenix - though to a native like me, it's just one more reason to remember why Phoenix is so great.  \n\nWhen most folks used to think of South Phoenix they thought of crime, blight and anything else associated with being on the \wrong\"""" side of the tracks.  Sure, there may have been areas right next to downtown that were like that, but most of South Phoenix was all farming community.  While some of this still exists - especially near and in Laveen - most of these farm plots were sold off during the years to individuals for their own homes - and any of the large lots were sold off to developers in the last 10-15 years or so.  Most of these became mass produced houses (like mine) or shopping centers.  The Farm is off of 32nd street (with property stretching back almost to 24th street) between Baseline and Southern.   To put this in perspective - there is a huge Target/Fry's/Ross/Applebee's kind of complex at 24th and Baseline - and the South Mountain Community College is just North of that on 24th.  At 32nd and Baseline there is the Raven Golf course, with lots of condos all around it.  That all seems a whole world away once you pull in to The Farm.\n\nI'm attaching some pictures from their web site www.thefarmatsouthmountain.com.  I've been only to one of the restaurants so far - The Farm Kitchen which is their lunch spot.  But I plan to visit Morning Glory soon.  All the stores are amazing - and it's so cool to see where it all grows.  As we walked by the gardens it was great to see some kids (and adults) having the process explained to them of how they grow the food organically here - and it could end up at one of their restaurants, in one of the nicer restaurants in the valley, or sold at their Farmers market to be eaten in their own home.\n\nCheck out their menus online.  Yes - it's a bit pricey.  I was hesitant that I'd think it was \""""worth it\"""".  But oh it was.  I can't explain it any better than stealing from a commercial - You can TASTE the freshness!  Everything just tasted so much better.  Not that the atmosphere didn't help - but it wasn't the only factor.  One interesting thing to mention - pets are ok.  There were two folks there who brought their dogs.  The doggies seemed quite happy to have some run around space (leashed of course) and then a nice meal by a picnic bench.  \n\nI'm planning to go again - bringing lots of friends and family at different times.  I'd love to try out their yoga and/or gardening classes too! This will definitely be on the short list of places a visitor needs to go when visiting from out of town.  Better yet though - it's one of the few places you can go in town and feel like you took a day trip out of the valley."""""""

<review>So good! Driving around Phoenix on a Saturday night looking for Italian, checking yelp, and we find Aiello's - what a treat!\n\nCozy ambiance, enticing aromas greet you as you walk in the door. Smells the way I want an Italian restaurant to small - warm, slightly tomatoey, garlicky - welcoming :0)\n\nWe were quickly seated though the place was crowded. Warm breads and spicy dipping peppers brought to table with drinks.....mmmmmmm.\n\nService was friendly and knowledgeable - owner Joe stopped by to check in\n- was visible in the dining room throughout our visit - nice wine list - my medium red was smooth and fruity - entrees plentiful and prepared as you order them....this is not The Olive Garden! We were happy with both our choices and hope to return!! \n\nWine, salad and entree for me was $30- excellent value for service and experience!!! Big recommendation for Aiello's !!!!!
</review>
<review>How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint that's less authentic - hit up Z'Tejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and it's hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!

<review>"""Eat Mor Chikin. That's all I can say. Chik-fil-A and baseball apparently go together like pitching and Tommy John surgeries. To avoid paying a premium for buying food at the ballpark, we stopped at a nearby Chik-fil-A for a quick bite. I spent $6.29 on a chicken breast sandwich, fries and a drink, and what did I find inside my paper bag? A coupon for $5 off baseball tickets. Talk about a win-win! \n\nPeoria Sports Complex is another great ballpark in Arizona! We came here last Monday for a Giants/Padres night game, and I was really impressed with the facilities. With the aforementioned coupon, we were able to purchase $21 club level seats for $16 apiece. \n\nNow, mind you, these are premium, wide, padded seats between home plate and first base for $16. Plus, you get an exclusive concession area and an elevator, should you need one. Most people in the section were older, armed with a scorecard and a #2 pencil. Our friend even caught a ball when he went to get a beer (and by \caught\"""" I mean \""""found it on the ground\"""" because he was the only one getting a beer at that time). \n\nThe ballpark's batter's eye reminded me of PETCO Park, which, I am sure, is not coincidental. Peoria Sports Complex has the best scoreboard in all of Cactus League, too. I am sure while reading this, some Padres AND Giants fans might channel Skip from Bull Durham and say: \""""What do we need a scoreboard for? We haven't scored any runs all season!\"""" I am sure that's about to change. \n\nParking here at Peoria Sports Complex is another matter. For $5, you get to park close to the stadium, but if you are too lazy to walk, just take the shuttle. The shuttle is a guy in a golf cart that seats seven. Man, I would pay $5 just for the ride. It's fun, kind of like a roller coaster ride for shut-ins. Highly recommended. \n\nNote: Nearby Hooters is open late after the game. So if you started your night with a chicken breast sandwich like I did, you can end your night with . . . Well, I'll let YOU finish that sentence."""""""
</review>
<review>This place was packed on a Tuesday night. Granted it was during Spring Training, but I don't think they have a problem filling the joint. It's got a great atmosphere. The bar seemed fun with live music playing and lots of people enjoying themselves. \n\nThe food... If you love enormous portion sizes, then this is your place. I had the petite fillet and couldn't finish it, which I was very sad about because it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. My husband had the bone in fillet, which was terrific as well. For sides we just ordered one because we knew we wouldn't be able to finish more than that. We had the crab gnocchi, which was great, but a little too rich for me -- not the restaurant's fault - bad ordering on our part. We didn't have room for dessert. Oh, one of the reasons we didn't have room for dessert is because we ate too much of the amazing bread basket they bring you. Pretzel bread, olive bread, amazing sourdough rolls - all worth trying. \nThe service was OK. Definitely some room for improvement. Overall though, the experience was good and you can't dock them for the service because the food shines. \nThis place would be great on an expense account.
</review>
<review>They are everything and more of what you expect from a local, neighborhood breakfast/lunch cafe.  They don't pretend to be something they're not.  There's no hype, just some odd decor, good seating (mostly booths),  good food and friendly service.    \n\nWe meet our friends here for breakfast almost every weekend.  Is it the best breakfast I've ever had? No, but it's always exactly what we order.  The pancakes are great.  The coffee is good and always flowing.  The eggs always come out perfectly cooked.  The egg salad sandwich is a winner.  Friend typically gets a salad and it looks nice and fresh.  There's nothing that really stands out but stick with the basics and you're good to go.  \n\nWe're never rushed out of our booth even though we stay a little bit longer than we should.  Kelsey knows us all by name and we love being greeted by her smiling face and quirky personality.    \n\nI'm always a fan for a place that is clean and makes me feel at home.
</review>
<review>What a wonderful place!  There was nothing on the menu that I wouldn't get along with.  It took me a while to decide because everything sounded fantastic.\n\nI started with one of their fresh squeezed/blended juices (ginger, agave and soda).  It was light, refreshing and REALLY good.  Highly recommend this one.\n\nI finally decided on the tuna sliders which comes with a side of kale salad or roasted sweet potatoes per the menu.  Our server told us that we could get it with 'half and half' sides.  So, of course, I went half kale salad and half sweet potatoes.\n\nThe sliders were good but the size of the tuna in each was not real consistent - the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars.  Another person in our group also ordered the sliders.  For my two, one of my sliders had a really thin piece of tuna and the other one had about a 1/2 thick chunk.  The other order had different size pieces too - strange.\n\nI usually don't order dessert but was really tempted by the 'stellar' Banana Chocolate Caramel Tart as described by our server.  'Stellar' was the perfect description for this masterpiece.  The chocolate crust contained mesquite flour which I found really unusual as I had never had it before.  We visited the Desert Botanical Garden and learned about the mesquite tree/shrub and the guide told us how they make flour from it.\n\nService was absolutely top notch FANTASTIC!  Our server was super helpful and knew that menu backwards and forwards and knew all the ingredients/spices in everything. \n\nI wish we had this kind of a place in central Illinois!
</review>
<review>There's this Chinese math teacher at the school I work at (I know, how cliche right?) and he's been telling me all year that I HAVE to go here, and that it's the most authentic Chinese food around town.  So finally, I did.  I have no idea about authenticity, but I do know it was delicious and cheap.  It was pretty crowded on the day we came in, but we found our own seat and waited a few minutes before menus were brought to us.  There are about a billion choices, all of them priced well under 10 bucks.  This place simply cannot be beat for value.  \n\nAbsolutely clueless about what to order, I stuck with what I knew, and got the Orange Chicken Bowl, an egg roll and a can of soda that only cost 92 cents.  Our food didn't take too long, and my egg roll came out first.  It was so tasty!  It was packed full of good stuff and the sauce to dip it in was quite good.  My Orange Chicken Bowl came out in the shape of a plate.  I thought that was odd, but who really cares.  The orange chicken was really good.  It had a bright flavor and the sauce was just thick enough to cover the chicken properly.  The fried rice was the best fried rice I have ever had.  I still think about it actually.\n\nI would definitely love to come back to this place, especially since it is right by the Light Rail.  Hopefully I will be better prepared to order something a little more adventurous next time.

<review>This place is the Hope Diamond of hidden gems! I grew up in an Italian household, so Italian food is as personal as it gets for me. And this place does Italian well enough to please my grandmother. My husband and I went for a romantic dinner, and we were not disappointed at the amibance of the place. The owner himself was seating everyone and while it was an air of elegance, we also felt really welcomed. Our waiter Julio brought us our menus and ice water right away, which was great because it was super hot out, even for Arizona. We selected a Chardonnay from Fess Parker vineyards, and because we had a gift certificate from restaurants.com, we opted to split a bottle of it. It was the first of many great decisions. For our appetizer we split the antipasto for 2. Incredible. Fresh veggies that were perfectly roasted, cold, salty meats, sweet rich cheeses, awesome! Their fresh sourdough bread was a pleasure to eat, with that just right crispy crust and light, fluffy middle. We both had the ceasar salad, which really prepped us well for our meal, as it was well sized and not overly dressed.  I ended up with the seafood risotto and my husband had the baked ziti with sausage. We were stunned. First of all, they came out HOT! Not the luke warm-ness that's becoming too common now, but truly hot! My husband loved his ziti. He went so far as to say it's better the first baked ziti he ever had, which was on New York's Mulberry Street with his parents when he was a teen. My risotto had so many layers of deep intense flavor I was beside myself. Not overly full of seafood, but enough to satisfy the craving, the clams, mussles, scallops and shrimp were to perfection. There was small peices of shredded lobster throughout. The peas, red peppers and asparagus were done well, but not mushy and the rice was just al dente. The saffron lobster bisque broth was intense in flavor but let each aspect of the dish shine through! As much as we were enjoying dinner, we decided to take half of each portion (very large portions, so bring friends or a large appetite or be prepared to take some home) home with us so we could have dessert. I'm so glad we did. We had the vanilla creme brulee. You could actually see the vanilla beans in the custard. And it wasn't overly sweet. Too many are cloyingly so, but not this one! And it had a rather thick ring of the burnt sugar, which I liked, cause to me that's the best thing about creme brulee. The owner, as mentioned by others, was all over the place, but always making time to sit and chat with his patrons to make sure they were happy. Julio was fabulously attentive, not being in our faces, but our glasses were never empty and the pace was perfect. We agreed this is a place we'll be going to at least once a month, if not more!

<review>"""I've been going to Oregano's for years. It has always been fantastic. The wait can get ridiculous at times so I plan accordingly. But the last time I went it was less than stellar. To avoid the wait for a table (it was rainy and cold this day otherwise we would have taken the faster option of getting seated with first available) we chose to sit at the bar and eat. The waiter took the order of the couple sitting next to us and then took ours immediately after. Our neighbors received their order in the expected amount of time, however, our order did not come out until our neighbors had eaten and paid. This was a bit annoying since we were quite hungry and the orders were taken at the same time. They ordered a large pizza and salads. We ordered a small pizza and a order of wings (their wings are terrific fyi). So I didn't see what the hold up was. When we finally received our order I was not at all satisfied with the pizza. It didn't have the same crispy, delicious crust I was used to, but I am not the type to complain about the food unless there is something seriously wrong. So I just dealt with it. I went to the lady's room to sufficiently clean up the wing sauce and when I got back I overheard the waiter/bartender and my boyfriend talking. He asked how everything was and my boyfriend said the pizza was ok but the wings were great. The waiter left and we were visited by whom I think is the manager. She was an older lady and looked in charge anyway. She came, made some small talk and laughed with us for a moment, and then asked us about our experience. She heard our pizza was only \ok\"""" and wanted to know what it was that only made it \""""ok.\"""" So I explained to her and she took what I said seriously. She also took the price of the pizza off the check which was not necessary at all. Although it had been a less than stellar visit to Oregano's I knew that I would be back again because all the other times I've been there have been wonderful. I was completely delighted with this experience because they really showed that they care about what their customers think and they care about their experience with them. I recommend checking it out! Also, do not pass up the pizzookie (pizza cookie), it is to DIE for! yummmmm!"""""""

<review>This lake is a hidden lil gem... well, I'm sure it's well-known to people who have lived in the Phoenix area for a long time but we stumbled across it yesterday while driving around, taking pictures of cacti.  (yeah - i know)\n\nIt's so cute and quaint.  Not a big lake or major water sports destination but, it has a lil restaurant and a marina... and yesterday it was a nice destination and provided some great photos.  \n\nI'll return this summer!. :)\n\nSee ya there!

<review>Being from the North Carolina coast and now living in Glendale, Arizona I find that the food I miss the most is seafood. Clearly living in Arizona limits my ability to find good, fresh seafood-let alone trying to find well prepared seafood. Tonight I found fresh seafood that was prepared just the way I like it-fried with extra sides of tartar sauce, cocktail sauce, coleslaw (mayo not red), and a healthy selection of domestic beer. \n\nTy, the server at the counter, was helpful and very interested in making sure the dining experience was met with great service. While the atmosphere left you feeling like you may end up with a pirate cap (e.g. Long John Silver), the beach music on the radio made me feel like I was home. \n\nThis wonderful little find came to me by pure accident as my wife was giving me directions to Next Place Coffee (see my next review) and mistakenly gave me 59th and Union Hills as cross-streets. Great mistake, babe, because we were treated to a little bit of home. \n\nI'd recommend Oscar's Pier 83 to anyone in the market for a quick, well prepared dinner.

<review>This is a great place that is close to everything on the Mill Ave District!  My Girlfriend and I always make sure to stop after going swimming at the ASU campus for the Tuesday and Thursday after 9 U-Call-It's!  The U-Call-It's include EVERYTHING unlike most bars who only do call drinks.  The only exception that I could find is that for Yager Bombers the Redbull is two dollars extra (still cheaper than your average bars bombers!)\nIt's a beautiful active bar with friendly and fun bartenders!  I work at one of the Radisson's in Phoenix and constantly send people to this bar and have never received a complaint!  This is by far one of the best hidden secret of the Mill District!

<review>I go here for the 3-D movies.  They are in REAL3D.  Better than any other Cinema.  I also like going in to see a movie in the evening and coming out to see all these old school cars lined up in the street.  I get my movie date and my husband gets his car fix.  This place is great for family, singles, and dates.\n\nThe seats are comfy and large for my big booty and easy to snuggle up to my hubby.  The place is always clean and has great quality picture and sound.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  They take Harkins Cups for refills!
</review>
<review>Nice location in heritage park.  Beautiful home turned into nice restaurants.  A brief look at the menu had us pulling up our yelp app for some information on what to get.  Unfortunately the pork belly buns everyone was raving about was not available.\n\nWe chose: Grapefruit and Hamachi, Big-Eye Tuna Tataki, Seabass and Mushroom, and finally the pork belly and rice.  Every dish was succulent.  They were on the small side, and I understand this is how tapas works, so you can share it, but it still left me feeling just a tad hungry.  Still the food was amazing and the flavors simply perfect.
</review>
<review>Though I rarely visit this place, I still find it the best place to fix your burger with your choice of condiments. Though the appetizers come in small doses, the onion rings are sweet and the zucchini are bite size. It has a nice open space.You can watch the current college game while waiting in line to place your order or find the best seating that you can watch it from afar. \n\n[Some day, hope to see someone order the Retirement burger.]
</review>
<review>Very, very hip, trendy place to hang out.  They have it all here. Great place for families and hipsters alike.  The shopping looks really cool with vintage clothing galore.  The PF Flyers were especially interesting.  Tried the famliy pack of Sliders, Brisket, Sausage, Meatball and Tuna. They also have Egg and Chicken I think.  Also tried the Apple Fritter desert.  Very good.  The night I went was the first night they tried music.  it seemed to go over well and the owner, Steve told me they plan to have more music acts in the coming months. \n\nSince I mentioned Steve, the owner, Let's go ahead and mention the staff.  The second I walked into the place I was greeted by an employee.  Welcomed and given the nickel tour.  The Staff at the bar and the trailer-kitchen (More about that in a min) were very friendly.  \n\nThe creative use of the space was so interesting. Its one of those places that the first time you are there you just sit and look around the space.  Vintage records hang from the wall, An authentic Hamm's Bear beer statue. Original Brick walls and exposed building trusses. \n\nNow to the vintage Airstream travel trailer.  They use it as an outdoor kitchen. You order your food from a picnic table and they make it in the trailer/kitchen.  Very Cleaver.  \n\nFor me, the best part was the vintage cocktails. I have been reading a lot about the trend to recreate old style cocktails that for one reason or another are not made anymore. Drinks like the old-fashion, the Cuba Libre, or Rusty Nail.  I could go on about the authentic soda fountain, the bakery and ice cream if I had more time. I will just say go to the Duce and see for yourself \n\nOne slight bummer is the prices.  Slightly expensive. $8 bucks for 3 sliders.  $10 for a desert that was pretty small.  Cocktails are all $10 and above. They seem to try to offer some inexpensive alternatives $3 for PBR's and Hamm's beer.  That may be a fun novelty but the reason those beers are nearly defunct is because they suck. I guess if you want to save some cash by chocking down some horrible beer, Knock  yourself out.  But if you want to get something decent, you need to be prepared to pay just a little more at the Duce. \n\nAll in all I highly recommend this place. Go check it out for yourself.  I know I am looking forward to my next visit.
</review>
<review>Suzie's is a cool place if you set your expectations properly. The food is decent, not overly memorable but definitely good for the price. The service is always mediocre at best ... but consistent. The atmosphere is hole in the wall / old  and  crusty ... but that gives it character. I'm particularly fond of Friday night's when they have a mariachi band crammed in the corner playing. Don't go out of your way for this place, but if you're in the neighborhood it's worth a stop.
</review>
<review>I am gonna go out on a limb and say they could have THE best chicken fajita burrito in the valley, if not this side of Rocky Point!!!  I felt like the chicken had been pulled from the coop out back and flavored from grandmas long lost recipe.  And their tortilla!!!  I know that Carolinas has been winning the tortilla award for the last 20 years, but I think Revo will give them a run for the money in the next go round.  All of this greatness was accompanied by fresh raspberry/strawberry lemonade that was just like the fresh stuff you get at the fair!\nI was not as much of a fan of the shredded beef... but that is fine I don't need anything else but there chicken!  the other negative no cervesa or margaritas!!!

<review>"""Eden's Grill is, without question, home to some delicious, homemade Middle Eastern food. Not since going to the houses of friends of my father many years ago have I tasted food like this. \n\nI should clarify...\n\nThere are great Middle Eastern restaurants in Phoenix, but a lot of the places have food that tastes like restaurant/deli food. This is not bad at all...restaurant food can be very delicious. But, then there are places that serve food the way \Mom\"""" makes it. It's that special little bit of love that I'm talking about. In the case of Eden's Grill, \""""Mom\"""" IS making the food. Well, not my mom, but the mom of the great waitress that served my table today (So sorry I didn't catch her name.). \n\nFor our lunch, Bobby T and I went for a side of hummus and baba, a gyro plate and a beef kebab sultani plate. The hummus and baba were solid, loaded with garlic and topped generously with olive oil. The gyro plate was also solid, the meat wasn't too dry and the veggies were definitely fresh. Above the previous two menu items stood the beef kebab sultani. Each bite had the two of us smiling because it was so good. The kebab meat had flavor infused into the core of each piece...never did I chew a bite and not get the flavor of the marinade. It was awesome. We also got to taste some of their hot dolma. I have only been served hot dolma at three restaurants, and each time they have been great; definitely worth trying if you're a dolma fan.\n\nThere is one last thing that we tried that everyone needs to come to Eden's Grill for though, and that is the rice - basmati w/ golden raisins and chopped almonds. The rice especially tasted like it was made with love and not just by a chef. I still crave it as I write this (good thing there was plenty left over). \n\nI'm excited about this \""""new\"""" find for me, and I think other Yelpers should be as well."""""""

<review>My friends and I made it to U.S. Egg yesterday for brunch.  This place was absolutely bustling!\n\nLuckily, our wait was great -- only 10 minutes.  This gave us time to go over the sizable menu.\n\nI had the Sonora Breakfast burrito.  It was SO freakin' good!  Lots of chorizo -- which was surprising, because that seems to be the first thing they skimp on.  It also had peppers, eggs, and several other very yummy things.  It came with potatoes that were really good too.\n\nMy friends got one of the veggie frittatas, and thought it was fabulous.\n\nOur waitress was sweet, chatty, and very helpful.  \n\nThe only thing that wasn't great was the coffee -- it was just OK.\n\nThis is one of those places that should become a weekend routine!

<review>My boyfriend and I wanted to try someplace new. We have drove by Scramble several times so on this particular morning after we took the kids to daycare we stopped in for breakfast. It's nice and clean inside, you walk in to read a big menu and place your order at the counter. They give you a number to put on your table and the waitress brings your food out.  Both of our food was good, will be back to try different items.

<review>"""Awesome concept, love the idea of a health-conscious fast food joint, but as far as \fast\"""" goes I think they could speed up their game for their drive-thru just a bit.  Last few times I ordered food through the drive-thru it took about 10-15 mins for a drink and breakfast sandwich.  Plus, when I got the sandwich it was just a little bit sogalicious. However, today I thought I'd give them another try and sit inside.  Was a little more impressed with their service and food this go-around.  The guys working were cracking me up, very witty and sarcastic--kinda like the personable attitude of a West Coast coffee house; super laid back like hanging in a friend's kitchen.  I ordered their traditional breakfast burrito and it was very D'lish, not soggy but very hearty and filling, eggs were perfectly seasoned and loved the flavor of the salsa.  Definitely willing to try this place again, but from now on I'll probably sit inside or put in a pre-order.  Really wish their hours went a lot later through the evening instead of closing at 4pm. I think they could probably triple their business if opened at night given the location.\n\nUpdate 08/25:  Just gave this place an additional star...I've been more and more impressed w/ DLish because they've definitely sped up their drive-thru game!  I look forward to continuing my dining business with them again and again!  Would rather support local caf\u00e9s over any mega-tron monopolies (*cough* Starbucks).  Also, just recently tried their blackbean and quinoa burger...ummm yeah, very DEEElicious, super ++ !"""""""

<review>Love...love...love Spinatos!  Honestly, one of the best pizzas in town.  I've been eating here since the mid 90's and it has consistently been great!  I usually get the Super Six.  It has everything on there except the kitchen sink!   The thin crust is never ever soggy and that sweet sauce is like crack to me!  The service is always great.  Do expect a wait on Fridays and Saturdays.  If you have more than 8 people in your party, prepare to wait atleast 1 hour or more on busy nights.  For an appetizer, totally go for the bruschetta!

<review>I recently revisited Coach House for the Yelp in Bloom after party, so it's time for an update and fresh in my mind... \n\nAnd after reading my original review, my husband kindly informed me that Coach House did indeed remodel several years back.  They added an outdoor bar, some hanging outdoor heaters, and additional patio space.  \n\nFor some reason, the extra outdoor space does nothing to hide the odor of stale cigarettes and sticky beer spills.  Don't get me wrong, I love a dive bar every once-in-awhile, especially when it's super close to my house, but Coach House will never be a regular in my rotation... and will always require a good ten minute shower and shampoo / conditioning rinse of my hair.  They may have remodeled but some things never change... including the dive bar scent at Coach House!

<review>"""Stopped by here for lunch today, just kind of on a whim. I'd never been in the old Marvin's Garden diner, but it didnt seem like much could have changed. Hell, the booths even have signs saying you can't sit there as a single between 11-2, lol.\n\nWhen I walked in the side door, a woman looked at me and held up one finger, so I nodded yes I'm alone. She put a menu down at the counter and had a bowl of celery soup and an egg roll before I got there. Pretty good start. I took a glance at the menu and ordered the cashew nut chicken and it came within 5 minutes. The place definitely seemed to have perfected the \quick lunch\"""" concept. The service was flawless from start to finish, as well. Everything I had, including the usually bland celery soup was delicious. The cashew nut chicken being probably my favorite asian dish I've had in quite some time. It all seemed very light and on the healthy side as well.\n\nI ended up with a bill of $7.33 which for the amount of food, and the quality of food, and the quality of service, I was very pleased with. They are doing a lot of things right here, and I think this will be a very successful restaurant in the Midtown dining scene. I only hope the best for them as it really is great."""""""

<review>"""I have to say that I was pretty intimidated to try Cartel about a year and a half ago - simply based on poor service reviews and threats of hipster judgment.\n\nWhen I want coffee, its because I'm beastly. I just woke up, I'm not looking like the hottest/hippest/nicest person in Tempe. I mean, I never look like that but when I NEED coffee, I need to dose myself in a safe and secure environment.\n\nSo I went to Cartel expecting the worst, I ordered Iced Toddy. To keep my order neutral and cheap. It was okay. Pretty f-ing good in comparison to xtreme bean, my only other Toddy experience. I branched out into soy Lattes because I like to get some protein in the morning. I know....latte for breakfast - aren't I a pillar of health?\n\nNO ONE judged me when I would order my soy latte with sugar-free vanilla in it. NO ONE. I've gotten some jokes about it, but who gives a fuck? It's $4.50 - I'm being a yuppie suburban bore when I order it and I know it and I don't give a shit if they know it. I love them for keeping me in check anyways. How is a kid from Tempe supposed to know anything about coffee? That's not my business. As the customer, it's our business to try new things as suggested by the people who's life's work is coffee.\n\nSo I tried an americano by suggestion. Its DELICIOUS. GET ONE. Iced/Hot, whatthefuckeverjustgetone. I go here for an americano EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE except when I am out of town and I bemoan the lack of Cartel even when I'm in Los Angeles (Mighty City of Intelligentsia). Which brings me to another point, the LINES.\n\nIf you are looking for a McLatte, they exist. It's called McDonalds. They are everywhere. Cartel is not a run in/run out kind of place. They are offering a luxury item as well as an experience. You wouldn't go to a spa and bitch about your facial taking too long. If you want to see lines, go to Intelligentsia during the midday rush and you will immediately appreciate what Cartel is doing.\n\nFor serving the entire ASU community with outstanding coffee, 20 minutes sounds about right. For a drink that is delicately crafted from bean to cup, $2.50-$4.50 is just right. For a locally owned company successfully competing with corporate giants, you might as well just go and give a deserving shop your money. \n\nAnd if you are nervous about being judged by the \hip\"""" kids who look like they smelled a fart, recognize that they are only posing with their macbooks and modern literature and are too vain to break character. \nAnd if you are nervous about being judged by the baristas, try SMILING at the people who are SERVING you - because you remember how hard it was to deal with customers before you got your middle management salaried job, right?\n\nI love you, Cartel."""""""

<review>I haven't been to Coach and Willie's in a few years, and I was delightfully surprised at all of the things I forgot about.\n\nThe decor is way nice for a sports bar. Dark wood, marble topped bar.  It's just so pretty.\n\nA great selection of draught beer and bottles.  They even have Rogue Hazelnut Brown on Tap!! YAY!\n\nAnd, the last time I was here I was still a vegetarian and hooked on the garlic and spinach cheese sticks which are actually wrapped and fried like an egg roll.  We had them as an appetizer and they are as good as I remember.  Also served with two dipping sauces - ranch and a heavy marinara.  I wish they had some imagination inspired sauce, but they definitely did the trick.\n\nAnd then I had the burger.  I ordered the Three Alarm burger with fries.  When the waitress brought it out, I was astounded by the amount of food on the plate.  It was HUMONGOUS.  I barely made a dent in the fresh cut french fries which were yummy, but not crispy enough for my taste.  The burger was so huge I actually had to open it up and eat it with a knife and fork sans bun and accoutrements.  It wasn't even barely spicy, but I didn't mind because it was such a good burger perfectly grilled to order.\n\nI felt horrible for eating so little of what was on my plate.  However, there was no way I was going to put the not-crispy-enough-for-me fries in a styrofoam box to take home.  And I ate what I wanted off the burger, the rest was extraneous.\n\nNext time: I'll ask for a plain burger and 1/4 of the normal amount of fries or some other side.

<review>These guys are open again! Its great to have a shop dedicated to the DH community back in Phoenix.\n\nWent to their grand opening last week. Not only did they have a fleet of demo Konas and Intenses to try out, they paid Gnar Gnar Shuttles to take us up the hill for the day. New bikes to play with AND free shuttles? You can't beat that with a stick, hammer and a mandate from the Supreme Court!\n\nReally glad to have them back in Phoenix!

<review>I have to show my love for Dolce and Caesar, the owner, again. I told him about an event I was having in November called CupcakeCamp. We were just chatting; I wasn't fishing for anything and he readily offered to donate coffee for the event. Now, that shows good business sense to really put yourself out in the community!\n\nI hate seeing how little business he gets in the mornings compared to week nights and weekends. I really wish more people would pull over while going thru the Camelback Corridor. Besides really good coffee, the man knows how to make good breakfast burritos and sandwiches. Cesar is a hardworking, kind and dependable proprietor. I really hope more people stop by and give this place a chance. It's actually opened late too!

<review>I loved the Pink Spot.  I have been there a few times already.  The first time I had to try the Kona Coffee ice cream.  It was delicious and so I got it in a shake and walked around Roosevelt during First Friday cooling off with my delicious shake.  I, being the coffee addict that I am, went back for another shake a few days later.  Oh my, it is delightful.  A couple of weeks later my husband and I were lunching at Z Pizza and walked through the doorway connecting the two and got the Kona Mint Sundae.  It is a scoop of Kona (my favorite) and Mint Chocolate Chip (his favorite) with hot fudge  and  whipped cream.  It was perfect for sharing and was a tasty end to our meal.  \n\nAlso, they have a really neat lamp hanging up at the end of the counter by the register that looks like white mesh tubes tangled together.  I was really interested in it so I asked the girl behind the counter where it came from.  The owner was sitting at one of the tables so we talked about it.  He even told me where he bought it in (a store up near Kierland Commons) and we had a nice little conversation about the design.  \n\nPink Spot has a couple of new fans....

I called on a Thursday afternoon. Even though I was told: \Sure, just bring it in\"""" ..no one could get it done before end of day Monday. That translates into a full weekend without my bike. No way! Chris saved the day and had me up and running for my Moab trip in no time.  Thanks so much Chris!"""""""

<review>Wow, this place has been open for just a month and I am the sixth review.  At first I was disappointed with the service, it was a little slow, but it turns out that we got there right before the next shift started.  Our server was very knowledgeable about wines and helped me make a great choice -- I concur with Natalie the pour was generous.  As we were getting ready to leave Bruno, chef and owner came by to talk to us.  He was very friendly (like his staff) and I can't wait for the next visit when I am in the area again.

<review>I am a fan of big and tasty sandwiches but have had very few really good ones as of late. That is until I tried this place. I was in the area and decided to give the them a try after spotting their sign. When I first walked in I noticed the place was empty (normally a bad sign) but it was a Thursday afternoon so no big. This was my first time eating here so I took a few minutes to see what they had to offer. The sandwiches here come in different sizes from a small 5 inch to a 2 foot extra long, which makes it easy to decide what to order depending how hungry you are.\n\nThe 8 inch sub is easily enough for one really hungry person or two not so hungry people. Seriously it is about the size of a subway foot long and taste way better to! You have three choices when it comes to bread. They are white, wheat, and sourdough. I chose sourdough for my sandwich and it was chewy and seemed to be really fresh. Like most sub shops they also have a selection of pre selected combos (18 to be exact) with toppings like Ham, Turkey, Pastrami, Salami, Capicolla, Roast Beef, and Tuna. The cheese selection includes Provolone, Swiss, Smokey Cheddar  and  American\n\nWhat makes this place so different from most sandwich joints is the fact that they hand slice your meat when you order it. No more slimy meat that has been sitting in a case for hours and floating in weird juices Yuck! Finally a place that understands that it is OK to take the time to slice meat for each customer because it makes for a better tasting sandwich. One that a customer will want to come back for over and over again\n\nFor me this place set the bar so high most of the other chain places will never be able to compare with the quality of not only the food but the great customer service that I received from this place. It is not often that a place is able to make such a great impression on me (read my other reviews) but I will definitely make sure to give them my business the next time I am in the mood for a sandwich. The only thing that brought their score down was the fact that they had no customer parking and I had to pay to park in the garage. Yes I understand it is Tempe but why not at least offer to validate my parking LOL.

<review>Looking for a Swimsuit or resort clothes?  Hate trying on bathing suits? This store is for you!  Even if you are a size 2 and love trying our suits this store is still for you!  I am a very hard to fit swimsuit person as the top is much bigger than the bottom in terms of size and I found 7 bathing suits that fit me perfectly!  Elise is amazing and they will even custom make a suit for you AT A REASONABLE PRICE!   I will NEVER buy another suit in Arizona at Dillards, Macy's Target or anywhere else.  In 45 minutes I had the best selection, customer service, friendly help and I never once felt like I could have found better styles or prices.

<review>After a long day of nursing a hangover and a long night of pretending to not be home because we didn't have any Halloween candy for trick or treaters, we decided we needed some pizza. I drive by Florencia everyday and we keep saying we need to check out some of the establishments in this shopping center. Yelp says it's good, so obviously, I trust the palettes of my fellow Yelpers. We headed up there, it was pretty dead and the owner met us at the door and said we could only get takeout because they were closing up at little early. It was only about a half hour early and the guy was real cool about it, so we were fine with it. We went up to the bar and ordered a 12 inch pepperoni and italian sausage. All the girls at the bar seemed really sweet. They told us about 15 mins, so we sat down to wait, one of the girls came around to offer us something to drink while we waited, which I thought was nice. I can see some of the comments about the decor. At first I thought it was odd that the floor is just concrete, but it actually all kind of grew on me after sitting there for a bit. It has kind of a rustic tavern-ish feel. We started talking to Val, the owner, who was a real nice guy. Telling us about the place, they've been there for 11 years I think he said, so it's a nice neighborhood joint. He was real down to earth, just sitting at the bar drinking a beer and catching the end of the game. We noted that they had a pretty interesting beer selection both on draft and in bottles, which he said he rotates fairly frequently. He seems to have a pretty strong passion for beer and real interested in getting in some local brews and interesting selections in there. We got our pizza home and it was cheesy and delicious. The crust wasn't super flavorful, but the texture was perfectly crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The sauce had good flavor and the ingredients tasted like high quality. The pepperoni had a real nice rich flavor and the sausage had a nice flavor with the fennel and other herbs and spices. True it was a little on the expensive side but I'd rather give my money to a nice guy like Val than to Domino's any day. I'm looking forward to heading up there again to sit at the bar, watch a game and enjoy some more pizza or perhaps one of his calzones with a local brew!

<review>I absolutely love this place.  The food is awesome and the owner genuinely cares about downtown PHX and giving her customers an awesome choice for dining.  I live nearby and eat here often.  Try the Pho- you won't regret it.  Spring Rolls are fantastic- I love the variety and splitting several w/my husband. Ambiance is awesome- not your run of the mill chain restaurant drab beige interior, as they've made over an eyesore of a historic home into a chic and welcoming spot you'd be proud to take a date... and you must take anyone who thinks the Phoenix food scene is lacking in character and hipness ;)

<review>My almost 3-year-old son loved this place!  It's a nice respite during the miserable summer weather.  It's perfect for kids his age.  There was something for all interests--visual, art, tactile, everything!  I love that all the rooms are kid-sized, including the sinks in the bathroom and a separate/lower hand-rail on the stairs\n\nProbably not the best value for crawlers or older kids.  But for 2-5 yr-olds, it's a wonderful place!  The only annoying part are the parents who don't lead their kids by example.  Saw some pretty poorly-behaved, rude, and bully kids there.  But that has nothing to do with the museum.  Just a sad commentary of the lack-of parenting skills out there.\n\nAnyway, we love the museum and think that it's the best $9/person we've spent all summer!

<review>It was my first time at the market, I spent the day there at Kids Korner Hanging out with Gabi decorating Yelp Bags. The kids booth is just as busy as any of the other vendors it was a lot of fun! \n\nI made a few laps and was really happy to see all the fresh produce and food items. I bought organic golden beets, tri-colored carrots, broccoli, butternut squash, meyer lemons, sweet potatoes, romaine and something that I don't even remember what it is ;-) at McClendons. \n\nI tried some amazing vegan tamales....SOLD! I'm not even vegan but they were delicious with corn, spinach and mushrooms. \n\nI had an equally delicious Raw Organic Vegan wrap from Chef Sarah's booth (not me) (see pics) It had Almond Hummus, Tapenade, and a bunch of veggies and greens all wrapped up in a collard green leaf. \n\nI also bought 3 loaves of bread from the Phoenicians IL Terrazzo. \nA Rosemary, A Pecan, Raisin and Currant and Ridiculously tasty Chocolate Cherry Sourdough which didn't even make it through the night! \n\nI topped it all off with a scoop of Love in the form of Basil Lime Sorbet from Sweet Republic. \n\nIt was a great day and I will be back!

<review>Great little deli dine in martket.  I come here for a sandwhich or sub that's truly unique.  Yea you can hit up subway but ewwww!!!!  This place serves up some mouth watering examples of a proscuitto sub or eggplant parm that are STELLAR!!!  If you're a kitchen pro or a mad scientist their choice of ingredients in the market are inspiring for the next set of recipes!  Though the hours are a bit brief whenever you can catch this place open you'll be more than happy that you did.  Always a great suggestion for first timers and I'll definately be back for more!

<review>Each week a different family member gets to pick where to eat after church. My daughter's (6yo) pick this week was Pacific Seafood Buffet, she loves any buffet but this one has left an impression on her for some reason. We have been there a few times before and they always have fresh Asian buffet style food. I like the Sushi... while it is your normal American style rolls, the chef will take special requests if you ask. They also have a few unique items that rotate at different times... and allow you to experiment.\n\nA tip... go for a early dinner or late lunch, esp if you like things like the Crab Legs (Snow), as those things tend to go fast when the place is full (always been full when I go for dinner). And a side note - I hate it when one person takes like 20 legs full plate...and leaves none for anyone else....but oh well.

<review>This place pleasantly surprised me. For years I've looked over at this sandwich joint as I walked into one of my all-time favorite lunch time spots Essence Bakery. I ordered today's sandwich special which was a Cajun Grilled Chicken sandwich on a fresh baguette. The flavor of this sandwich literally blew me away! The combination of the spicy grilled chicken, lettuce, melted cheese, saut\u00e9ed green and red peppers with onion was YUMMMY!!! The portion was a little big for me but I managed to scarf down the excess! It was definitely worth the $6.95. I loved the little mini cookie that all the sandwiches come with, it was more or less a sample because I definitely wanted to buy the larger cookie after that tease. My sister had the Sacks Overture which is basically a spruced up Roast Beef sandwich, she said the beef was good but the Horseradish sauce snuck up on her (too bad she doesn't have spice tolerant palate). The place has indoor and outdoor seating. Inside is a little too dim for me, but hey I didn't come there for great ambiance I came for a great sandwich and my mission was accomplished. See ya soon Sacks!

<review>I have been living in phoenix for the past 11 yrs now and have never been here before. i know, its pathetic.\nI went on wednesday with two business associates for a light and loose business meeting.\nwe had a late lunch, about 1:30, so we were seated immediatelly.\nOur server (whom I forgot his name) was a nice honest guy that joined us on a few laughs during the meal.\nOne person ordered the salmon over mash potatoes, and enjoyed it very much, the other guest and my self had the spicy cashew and chicken. Ive had this meal in Chinese restaurants before, and can say this place beat them all hands down. just enough spice, great flavor! \nwe had a couple (ok a few)  margaritas, and mojitos, as well. the drinks were large and very tasty. i had the pineapple. im not a fan of drinks that arrive at the table with umbrellas and all that, so I didnt need the giant pineapple chunk stuck to the side of the glass.\nThe price was fair, 3 people 3 large drinks each, 3 lunches\ncame to about $125.\nwe had a great experience, would recomend anyone to go.

<review>There's nothing not to love...\n\nIt's rare to find a place that's so unusual in the middle of Phoenix. \n\nEverything is good and they have these french pancakes that I can't resist getting each time I go. That's a problem because their pizza is so good... So now I figure I'll still get the french pancakes and take a pizza home for dinner.\n\nI just like the whole atmosphere. Very city like with tight cramped rows of grocery items and gifts along with tables scattered about to sit and enjoy the weather. \n\nSandwiches, Breakfast, Pizza and don't forget the most beautiful decorated cakes I've ever seen. I have yet to try them because they appear dangerous to my thighs.

<review>My husband and I went here on a Saturday for lunch; we were seated immediately and our waitress was very attentive. My husband isn't very experienced with sushi, and I'm not exactly an expert either, so she was great about going over the menu and trying to help my husband use the chopsticks (he managed to break the training ones). \n\nMy favorite was the Tunacado and my husband's favorite was the Las Vegas roll. We ordered the pineapple cream cheese wontons for an appetizer and they were good, but nothing to rave about, so I'm glad we got them for free with a coupon. My husband ordered Sake, but the waitress forgot about it (as did we) until the end of the meal, so she gave it to us on the house. I guess Sake is best when sipped throughout the meal, so that was kind of a waste, but at least it was free.\n\nOverall, it was a fun and satisfying sushi experience.

<review>I like this bar alot. The drinks are cheap for the area, not watery and the shenanigans are HILARIOUS!  Drunk kids making out, hands on asses, under skirts- you name it. Of course you have to come after 11pm. I find the men are generally attractive but are sporting the hideous khaki's and flip flops- please with the damn flip flops!!!  Do you think you are Jimmy Buffett?\nOne thing to remember is there is half of the place without a roof, safe in Scottsdale one might say----Wrong!  The first time I went it rained all over my flip flops!

<review>I have been here only once and it was for my best friends birthday.  I made a reservation but it was unfortunately late in the evening because I made it late.  I expected there to be more people since I was told that the only time they had available was 915pm.  I was ok with this but only because it was for my besty.  We arrived and were quickly seated.  Since it was her first time they went over the whole shpeal about how it works.  We started out with the Wisconsin Trio Cheese Fondue.  I had never thought of bleu cheese in a fondue but boy was this rich and creamy.  We thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  The only dipping item that I didn't enjoy with it was the uncooked broccoli.  We then moved to the Cesar Salad.  The parmesan encrusted pine nuts were so good we spent quite a bit of time talking about it.  We then got the Land  and  Sea and a side of the teriyaki-marinated sirloin.  The fun of cooking the food soon became apparent.  She had thought that this would be tedious but quickly warmed to it and enjoyed finding the perfect cook time for the shrimp so that the tail slid right off.  She enjoyed finding different dipping sauces for each of her meats and for the veggies.  The night quickly moved to dessert.  When we were kids we would stay up late and watch horror movies and melt chocolate and peanut butter so The Original was a perfect match for us.  By this time we were fairly full and had forgotten to save room for dessert.  But we ate it anyway.  I love the dippers that are provided.  The strawberries are always fresh and sweet, the bananas were good (based on my friends review, again with the stupid allergies),  The cheesecake was rich and creamy, Rice crispy treats are always good and then add peanut butter and chocolate and heaven is tasted, the graham cracker encrusted and oreo encrusted marshmellows are wonderful and I wish I knew how to make them, the poundcake was divine and the brownies were rich.  Needless to say the dessert was a hit.  The price is high but worth it.  Had to take a star away for the late reservation even though they weren't very busy.  The waitress was ok but the experience at the Scottsdale location with the flambe was an added enjoyment.  It is a nice location.
</review>
<review>There's only one reason this place gets 5 stars (besides the awesome guy who is usually working) and that is the California Burrito. The rest of the food is pretty much Filibertos-esque but for 4.50 you can get a huge burrito stuffed with carne asada, pico, cheese, and french fries. Make sure to ask for the jalapeno salsa with it as that pretty much takes it from good to awesome. If I'm in Tempe whether studying or drunk and I want some quick food cheap there's a good chance this is what I'll be hitting up.\n\nActually, I lied. The Cali Burrito would earn this place 4 stars but being open 24/7 and having the burrito still delicious and fresh no matter what time I go gets it that 5th star.\n\nUpdate: Lately the Cali has lost something, maybe it's just I've gotten burnt out on it but it just doesn't seem as amazing as it used to. Either way this place is still solid but I can't really give it the 5 stars anymore.

<review>I have been taking my car here for washes for 2 years.  This is the best car wash place I have been to.  I would highly recommend it!  The prices are very reasonable, the staff is always offering me coupons same day to use, the car wash itself is great, the staff is extremely friendly, and I don't feel they are overly pushy for sales like some other car washes. \nToday, however, I had a new experience.  I lost my cell phone while I was there.  It was an extremely busy Saturday afternoon at a car wash, as you can imagine it would be.  You wouldn't have known it based on how the entire staff, including the owner, treated me.  They all helped me search  to find my phone.  I could not ask for better service than that!  =)

<review>i really can't believe that this place doesn't have more reviews... i discovered it about a 1.5 years ago and couldn't be happier with my find... i enjoy every visit as much, if not, more than the previous one. My favorite dish is the pork katsu, i'm not quite sure how its made, but the best way I can describe it is a 'tempura-fried pork chop'... but even trying to describe it as that simply doesn't do the dish justice...\n\nThe service has been exceptional every time, the front end guy on the register (who i believe is the owner) is always all smiles and is quite personable yet professional...\n\nP.S. be warned... this place accepts cash only, however the food is cheap enough that as long as you got a little jingle in your pocket, you shouldn't need to visit the ATM.... Also, if you're coming during lunch time, expect to take it to go... the building is somewhat small and has only about 4-5 tables inside and maybe 2-3 outside...
</review>
<review>FINALLY got to try this place, after I heard so many great things about it, and seeing it on the Food Network. First time I came was on a Monday a couple months back  and  they were closed. (SHAKING FIST AT YOU IN ANGER) But now they are open on Mondays.\nYesterday I went in wanting to try the honey blue cheese but they were out, determined to try something odd, I asked for the bacon ice cream- but they only have it on weekend. :(\nSo I ended up trying a few less-odd options, and you can definitely taste the pure simple yet delicious ingredients  and  quality in this ice cream. Very natural, full of flavor. I recommend the Strawberry. \nI did have a taste of the bacon brittle which had a very strong bacon flavor, personally, I would not recommend it. But the ice cream and regular brittle was very good.\nCan't wait to go back  and  try the horchata flavor.

<review>I was looking up papa johns to order some pizza and I saw some really bad reviews on google so I was second guessing ordering from here but my friend from to Tucson and says they have really good pizza so I order the pizza anyway and it was the best pizza I've ever had! ( they were saying they got sick and they were throwing up and not only on just 1 review) I don't know what the people on google were talking about but I will definitely be ordering pizza from papa johns again!

<review>"""I love my car. Perhaps to an unhealthy level. I just have to put that out on the table immediately in attempt to add some weight to the following statements.\n\nSince I found Goodspeed, when I am working on my car, I look to Goodspeed first. I go here for my oil and filters (They've got Motul oil. Simply the best!) I went here when I had trouble with my air intake and they helped me sort it out. When I started getting a check engine light related to my turbo, I went in here with my suspicions of the cause. I talked to Jon for a couple minutes to describe the problem, he reached under the counter, pulled out a part and said \This is what you need right here.\"""" And guess what? He was right!\n\nI will continue referring my friends here, and going here for all my needs, most especially when I start doing more serious tuning of my car.

<review>This place was amazing!  Thanks again to yelp, we found a place that very clearly rivals (and may even exceed) the AZ Bread Co. in Chandler for killer breakfast.   The coffee house/bistro/bar combo is inventive and will certainly have me coming back for lunch sometime to enjoy a beer or cocktail.\n\nThere wasn't a bad thing to say about our visit this late morning.  Ryan(?), the server, was amazing, just the right amount of checking in.  He also gave us a brief history about the place and how it was came new management recently, but kept the menu the same (except for the omission of ham last week).\n\nThe food was delicious and the amount was well worth the price (about $10/person for breakfast).  The red pepper hash was tasty, with a very slight crunch on the bottom and a mouth-watering flavour profile.  The other star of the food was the thick-sliced (homemade?) buttered sourdough bread.\n\nThe drinks were amazing drip coffee that wasn't so acidic that you suffer heartburn and had a deep, rich flavour that blew most restaurant coffee out of the water.  Also unsweetened apricot iced tea.  Just try it.  As long as you are a fan of bold, well-brewed iced tea the very slight (but unmistakable) tinge of apricot will do nothing but improve the experience, especially on a hot Phoenix summer day!\n\nBottom line, go here, contribute to the local economy and let's turn the Orange Table a Scottsdale classic to be enjoyed for many years to come!

<review>If you care about your car, you'll make the effort to head to Los Olivos Hand Car Wash. I'm pretty particular and careful about the care of my car. So much so, that in the past, unless I need it waxed or detailed, I usually washed and vacuumed myself. \n\nNow, I find myself still sneaking in for a little TLC at Los Olivos though, when I am too lazy to do it myself. The staff is super nice and very helpful with letting you know about what they offer and any specials without being pushy in any way. They even have a punch card and eventually you get a free wash. Pretty dandy eh? \n\nThe waiting area isn't top notch, but it's a car wash people. It does have a small shop with sodas, snacks, gift cards, random misc car items and some chairs to sit and wait. Supposedly there's a shoe shiner, but I'm still waiting for the day we're there at the same time. Additionally, Giant Coffee is just a hop, skip and a jump away, and that's usually where I am while I wait.\n\nI've been a loyal customer for awhile now, and this past weekend, realized it was time to get the interior of the car detailed again. They did a spectacular job which prompted my need to review. I ordered the mini detail which does a full job inside and a wash and buff/wax outside. The four hours was so worth it. They even offered to give me a ride home if I really needed, but I had prepared. My trusty laptop and I did some coworking over at Giant all afternoon. And when I was called that she was ready to do, I was in no way expecting to see my car look as new as she did over 5 years ago. I'm still in awe. Ever since, I've been showing her off, and it feels like I'm in a brand new car all over again. The paint is shiny and new, the inside was cleaned from top to bottom (even the ceilings) and the detail in the dashboard and console is incredible. I had already decided to never go anywhere else, but now I think I'll be getting it detailed much more often.\n\nYou will not be disappointed. I love this place.

<review>I thought Suski Roku was great.  It is way better than any hotel restaurant I've been to (except David Burke's Primehouse, of course).  \n\nI had edamame, a california roll and a shima roll -- shrimp wrapped spicy tuna w/ cilantro and avocado.  They were both fresh and excellent.  The nice part was that I could see the sushi man actually making them about 25 feet away.  Nice!  I did think they needed more creative sushi rolls but was definitely happy with the two that I had.  \n\nThe place looks great.  Nice tables, booths, everything.  A little dark with the lack of lighting but I'm fine with that--I know my dad would have complained about how hard it is to read the menu.  \n\nFor hotel guests, I guess they serve non-Asian food here for breakfast and lunch.

<review>"""Everybody raves about the carne asada and pastor, but we go for the bean and cheese burritos (no lard!), vegetarian quesadilla, and (for me) corn on the cob.  My kids are especially crazy about the bean and cheese burritos, and my youngest loves the vegetarian quesadilla -- flour tortilla with monterey jack cheese, lettuce, caramelized onions, guacamole. Corn on the cob is sweet white corn, lite mayo, cotija cheese, chili, lime.  Salsa is tasty and fresh -interestingly, it gets spicier if you leave it in the fridge overnight.  (Guac is just ok, in my opinion.) Also, order online for quick service.

<review>Beautiful location, beautiful decor, good prices at Happy Hour--what more can I say?  Went on a Wednesday as that's ladies night.  And we had heard it was Cougarville then, so I was hoping to see some old broads with gobs of makeup and looking sleezy to laugh at chasing younger guys.  Crud...none of that happened.\nGood food, good drinks at Happy Hour.  I have nothing to complain about with this place at all.  Kinda ruins my record, but this is really a nice place with every age group it seemed.\nAfter 10 pm they had a band playing that played great tunes with great singers.  Couldn't stay any more since we had been there since 4 pm to get a table outside on the patio area, but I would have loved to have heard more of this group playing as they were that good.\nI love this place and will come back again for sure!  I felt comfortable there even tho I am a geezer with other geezers, and appeared to have everyone from about 30 y. o. to death in the audience.\nGreat, great place to have a drink and relax!

<review>This bar has been part of the valley gay scene for so long... from what i've heard it's been around here for more than twenty years, another landmark but what impresses most is not solely its longevity in Phoenix but that its been in Old Town Scottsdale all this time away from what people call gay Phoenix in downtown. \n\nMy first introduction to BS West was a long time ago... well long to me... back in 2005. I had been to Charlie's, and at one time there was Crowbar which is now Club Downtown. Also had been to Boom! But never heard of BS West until someone mentioned on facebook group of a gay club hidden behind Acme in Old Town. They described it as the gay club down the alley that it was hidden that anyone could easily miss it. So I went with two friends and based on pure curiousty, walked down the alley next to Acme and saw a door (pre-patio days) with a sign above it that said BS West. It was a Sat. and it wasn't too crowded but we were in awe... it was true there was an actual gay bar near Tempe. And that's how I was introduced to the 2-4-1 drink specials and the BS West chips. \n\nThis video bar of which I think is its only kind in Phoenix and really haven't found any other video bars in other gay havens is such a nifty idea. I mean, haven't you ever been in a club and just didn't want to dance but the song is so good, that you gotta do something? well the video bar concept is awesome in that you can drink and watch the music video and kinda dance along... LOVE IT! You can never beat the drink specials here on Wed. which has always been 2-4-1 and Sat nights too. Both nights are crazy packed... that I'm sure it's against fire code but there's no restrictions... just a mass of gay men, and all kinds too, intermingle some queer peers too and it's just a great environment! Strong drinks too. But what I love apart from the drink specials are the poker chips which you can use as currency in the future. Certain colors mean certain drinks like cocktails, shots and the like. The Dj usually plays a good mix but depends who's there and if there having an off night but if you want a good time, strong drinks, and just a packed atmosphere... check out BS West or BS!

<review>My honey and I have been frequenting 5th and wine for the past couple months and love it. We have yet to actually sit at a table because we are scared to leave our great bartender. If you ever have the chance go, go just to meet Steve. He is awesome. Very friendly and informative about wines and the menu. He is also pretty good to look at :) I'm just getting into wine and he has been a fabulous guide and always gives great suggestions. I also have to eat gluten free now and he was extremely helpful! The steak was amazing and my honey loves all the bruschetta including the hummus one. I do not like the hummus one though. We enjoy this place and plan to keep coming back!

<review>All I can say is this place is phenomenal!  We came here on a whim while in town and were amazed at how great the food was and service.  We even used a restuarant.com coupon.  We have told dozens of our friends to stop by here if they are in town.  GREAT PESTO with the bread.  Yum.  Hubby had cheese ravioli which was to die for (and I don't even like the stuff).  \n\nDon't pass this place up, it was great.

<review>"""the breakfast we had deserved 5 stars! my bananas foster french toast was dreamy. it was so light and tasty, with a little crispy on the edges. even tasted what seemed like a hint of nutmeg? damn it was good!\nmy wife got an omelet and said she was happy with it. \nfor my beverage, i treated myself to a spicy bloody mary. it went down too easily. although i didn't really taste any alcohol, when we got up to leave, i got a little buzz on.\n\nthe place was packed on a saturday around 11am-ish. full of ASU kids and what looked like alumni. the interior is clean and bright but it is a bit congested as if they're attempting to pack as many people in as possible. there's a nice patio with misters which is where we chose to sit. \n\nyou order at the counter and then they do the thing where you put a sort of \marker\"""" thing on your table and then the servers bring out your food. personally, when i see this, i'm skeptical because i see alot of servers just kind of wandering around with plates of food looking for the customers. which is what happened to us. after a 15 minute wait, i went up to the counter and apparently they couldn't find us so we didn't get our breakfast. \n\ni whined a little and the manager (i think) came out, sincerely apologized and comp'd us another bloody mary. our food was out in the next 3 minutes. i appreciated his business practice. \n\ni hope we get to try this place again because alot of their items looked super tasty. hopefully we won't have to wait as long though!"""""""

<review>Great place with interesting menu.  I mean how many places in Phoenix serve Duck sandwiches and Duck Pizza.  The salads were also fabulous and everything was very affordable.  Friendly staff and very cool atmosphere and maybe with a few more places like this we can make Phoenix a little more like San Francisco with eclectic fun hip places to eat. Let's give Phoenix a bit of soul and not the bland urban sprawl (with all its chain restaurants) its known for!   This is definitely worth checking out!  If you like Postino's you'll like this place!

<review>"""I went for AZ Restaurant Week and got the $39 special.  \n\nI went with the Roasted Lobster and Corn Bisque: Tempura Cream Corn, Spicy Apples as my 1st course, the Kobe Flat Iron Steak: Bone Marrow Potatoes, Three Way Onions, Pinot Noir Reduction as the entree' and the Seasonal Berry Parfait: Honey Granola, Frozen Yogurt as dessert. \n\nSadly, overall, my expectations were not met by the food or the ambiance - only by the AWESOME service. \n\nThe complimentary duck fat french fries were definitely above average.  I could not really tell anything about them that screamed \DUCK FAT !!!\"""" but the seasonings on the fries and the sauces were all very tasty.  Not bad for \""""free\"""" food !!!\n\nThe \""""potato sponge bread\"""" or whatever that was they brought to the table was very \""""meh.\""""  Bland almost.  Forgettable.\n\nThe lobster and corn bisque was tasty and deserves a \""""Bravo!\""""  Met my expectations, maybe exceeded it a little bit. \n\nThe Kobe Flat Iron, however, fell flat (pun intended.)  I have prepared a Kobe NY strip (which I purchased at A.J.'s Fine Foods for $39/lb.) at home on my grill that tasted better than the dish I got from Bourbon Steak.   \n\nOne would expect a Kobe steak to \""""wow!\"""" you when you take that first bite and also that last bite, and in this case, it just did not happen.  The steak was not particularly flavorful, and was not particularly tender.  The onions overpowered the dish a bit, leaving me with a strong and unpleasant \""""onion\"""" taste in my mouth for the rest of the night.\n\nMy advice on Kobe steak:  if you want an affordable Kobe experience, hit A.J.'s and grill it yourself at home.\n\nThe Berry Parfait was totally tasty.  Great ending for the meal - super-fresh fruit chunks, everything worked together very well.  I'd pay $8 for that on a menu.\n\nThe place was very loud.  It was only about half full, but the sound reverberates in that place.  Tables are close together so you get to hear your neighbor's conversations, barely, above the overall din.\n\nThe SERVICE WAS SPECTACULAR.  Within 5 minutes of sitting down, I had my order placed, water to drink, and duck fat fries on the table.  They never let me sit there waiting around for water, or to remove a completed dish - they were ALL over it like a good team.  I'd bet 6 or 7 different people served my table.  Service definitely was the best part of the experience.\n\nSo, in summary:  Would I take a date there and spend $150 per person?  NO.  Would I take advantage of another $39 special next year and try something new?  Quite possibly, yes."""""""

<review>I found Eliana's when I was on a quest to find pupusas. I am from So Cal and I really miss the easy access to authentic multicultural cuisines. Currently I am on a new quest. This one is to get my 6yo daughter to try more things beyond her usual chicken. I thought of Eliana's because a cheese pupusa is pretty tame and kid friendly. She flipped for the pupusas (plain cheese-no condiments) and the Ensalada de Fruta (pineapple) and I got to feed my craving. \n\nBrought the hubby here as well and I am pretty sure he had Arroz a la Valencia. Hard to remember because it disappeared so quickly. Eliana's is a bit of a drive from our house, but it is becoming a family favorite nonetheless.\n\nThe service was good and quick. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the Plantanos Fritos con Crema y Frijoles as either an appetizer or dessert. Too yummy! And yes, the decor is shabby but the prices are low - it all evens out as far as I am concerned. Though try to get a table instead of a booth - the booths are pretty uncomfortable.

<review>Awestruck.\n\nThat is how I felt sitting on an overhang just off of the Boulder Canyon trail, taking in the most magnificent view I have seen since moving to Arizona.  Enjoying the pleasant warmth of the sun and the light breeze, it was one of those rare moments where I wouldn't change, well, anything.\n\nThe Boulder Canyon trail was my first venture into the Superstition Mountains/Tonto National Forest.  What a great introduction!  I am happy to know that something so enjoyable is less than an hour from my front door.  \n\nFirst, the winding section of AZ88 to/from Canyon Lake Marina (parking for the trail) is an experience in itself.  Definitely a take the convertible, drop the top, wind in the hair type of drive.  Woo!  Twists, turns, breathtaking views of the lake and rock formations, plus a couple of one-way bridges thrown in just to keep things interesting.   \n\nThe trail itself begins on the south side of AZ88, right across from the Marina, and immediately starts climbing into the hills.  Parts of the trail are a little challenging, with loose rock and a couple of fallen saguaro to maneuver around/over, and a few areas with somewhat steep incline.  Take it at your own pace, you will get there!  (hint:  if your friend is much faster than you and disappears into the distance, take solace in knowing you have the car keys... haha!)  There is a lot to see along the way - cool rocks, huge cholla and saguaro that look like something out of a Dr. Seuss illustration.  Due to the recent rain, everything was much greener than I expected too.  The reward at the peak is more than worth the effort - a panoramic view of Weaver's Needle, Battleship Mountain, La Barge Canyon/creek and the Superstition ridgeline.  Truly spectacular.\n\nIf you haven't been here, add it to your to-do list.  Now.  In a couple of weeks, there should be wildflowers...

<review>My first visit to the Grind was a 7pm dinner on a sunday with my 11 year old son.  We're pretty regular visitors to Delux Burger, but we've been hearing about the Grind for a while and thought we'd try it out for a change.\n\nThere were many people eating and drinking at the bar watching various games on the flat panels, but there was no wait to get a table.  In my experience staff at some of the other trendier restaurants around town tend to be a bit cool toward patrons with kids, but everyone at the Grind was accommodating and friendly to my son.  Our server took time to answer our questions about the burgers and made recommendations for us.  My son ordered a basic burger and I had the Steakhouse BLT Burger.  \n\nThe burgers were HUGE, the meat was very flavorful, both were cooked to perfection, and the presentation was top notch.  We also shared an order of the herbed fries which were a nice compliment to the burger.  Not the best fries I've had, but good enough.\n\nAll in all a very positive first experience at the Grind.  Highly recommended for a great burger in a cool atmosphere.

<review>Hugo was great, He has been there for 11 years and he knows how to cut hair, old school.  I felt he did a great job at all the classic details right down to the hot lather shave of the back of my neck and sideburns for a really crisp edge.  He made sure my brows were not bushy and that no stray hairs were growing out of my ears.  I have not had such a professional and enjoyable haircut in years and wanted to share the experience. While I was there a steady flow of people came in, The other Barber while I didn't catch his name seemed equally professional.  This is a Barbershop the old fashion way, a place for all kind of guys to get the haircut they are looking for

<review>I love Fajitas.  Have since I started going there as a kid.  Would I recommend anything other than the fajitas?  No, not really.  Its a bit pricey for me to be going very often, its special occasion priced for my budget.  \nYou get a skillet of piping hot meat and onions.  You get a side dish of pico, cheese and sour cream.  For people who like flour tortillas, this is HEAVEN.  they are homemade, thick, puffy, my mom eats them all by themselves and is more than happy.  I like to supplement with a side of beans and guacamole.  When less pregnant, well, much less pregnant I really like their margaritas too.

<review>"""Olive and Ivy gets four stars for decor, atmosphere, location and overall food. But for me, I wouldn't say Olive and Ivy has the best food in Scottsdale for the price. I been here three times, and tried appetizers, entrees and desserts. \n\nLet's talk about the wine menu, it is expansive with various wines avialable by the bottle or glass. Also O  and  I does have a specialty drink menu. I think the chopped chicken salad is better than the Meditteranean.. The bread they give you is light and served with a thick pesto sauce, and is very delicious. \n\nThe patio is great. As we get to the close of the fall, spring and winter season, heading into summer, get out on that patio asap. It is on the Scottsdale Waterfront, and they have misters and nice patio decor. Very relaxing, \upscale\"""" feeling place.\n\nAlso, they do have a small market, with food available to go, made-to-order and wine \navailable. I might check that out for lunch one day. I'm always tempted to raid the market before I go home, but I haven't yet.\n\nOne thing that jades my experience evertyime I've been to O  and  I is the hostesses. They usually have a weird attitude, and it seems like they are doing you a favor by seating you.  Waiters/Waitresses are always great, and I love their style! \n\nThis is a great place to take family or go on a special day."""""""

My last visit was over the top with first rate customer service and fun conversations.  \n\nBefore a few days ago it would have gotten a 4 star rating but my last experience was so good, I felt the need to add that 5th star.
</review>
<review>I'll be honest, I wasn't particularly impressed the first time that I ate here 2+ years ago. Since then, I've gradually come to really enjoy the food here, and we have gotten an explanation as to some previous inconsistencies with the food here at a certain point in the past (management/cooking staff changes were made). I normally order a two taco combo plate (the shredded beef is what I opt for), and they're pretty good. What really makes this place a win for me personally is their queso dip and their salsa. I swear, I could eat just chips and salsa/queso and be happy if I had to. Anyway, if you're in the Anthem area, this is one of the better options if you're looking to get away from the typical chain restaurant dining that plagues that area.

<review>This is a nice Italian joint for the Arrowhead area.  A little upscale and slightly pretentious but that can be overcome with the great happy that they offer.  There are many items offered for a discount from 4-6 Monday thru Friday and well worth it.\n\nLocated in the Citadelle plaza amidt other eateries, salons, and empty store fronts it's a little hard to find with no street exposure.  You would never know that this place looks so amazing inside.  Very nice seating area, a little dark but I think that's the way it's meant to be.  A beautiful enlongated granite bar that is very inviting and will enitce you to pull up a seat.\n\nIf you haven't been here it's definitely worth it to pop your head in here.

<review>"""I have always been interested in native American art, history and culture. The museum is a nice size and can be walked in an afternoon. I bought a membership so that I can go a few more times. I was amazed by the diversity of artists and tribes represented at the museum. In one gallery, there was an exhibit by an Inuit artist. In another gallery, there was an exhibition by a Navajo metal smith and jewelry maker. There is a great blending of the ancient native world with the modern native culture. \n\nI was going to bypass the interactive displays for the children, but found as I walked them that they were meaningful for adults too. \n\nDon't miss the Kachina display or the very sad and moving installation about the native American schools where young people were taken to be \civilized\""""."""""""

<review>Good Italian food just a couple of blocks from my house.  They have comfortable ambiance a little nicer than the other original restaurant.  Other comments about the food are on point.  However, I have gotten soggy pizza and watery salad in take out orders.  Hopefully this is just growing pains.  Consistent quality is the result of good leadership in the kitchen.  I will continue to visit, but for now, my first choice is the original location that is a couple of miles away.

<review>WOW!! This place is awesome. I love local coffee establishments. The place had a really homey feel to it. The art design on the wall gave the place a unique feel. They're hand drawn and painted, which separates itself from the Starbucks mass-produced art work. \n\nI loved the fact they used Pandora as their music source. Lots of great collection from indie musicians. \n\nI ordered the 12oz Mocha which was very delightful to the palette. It was smooth and refreshing, it didn't have that burn taste. It was just great! Their menu is VERY healthy.\n\nThe owners are very welcoming and great to talk to. I like how they interact with the customers which give it that personal connection. I'm definitely going back to this place it's just a GREAT place to hang!!\n\nThis place has potential. They are expanding their menu so watch for goodies within the next couple of months. They buy a lot of their produce from local farms which help sustain the community - I'm a big fan of that!!

<review>Great place to socialize, eat good food, and drink tasty beer! I would definitely reccommend this to people. I had a very creative burger called the popper burger which was really good. The person I was with also got a burger and said it was really good. We tried a few of the beers and were very impressed with them! I came on a Monday or Sunday night and it was busy. This is kind of a loud, social place, so I wouldnt reccommend going here if you're looking for a quiet, classy dinner...it is a brewing company!
</review>
<review>The decor is an odd mix of Arizona ranch and Colorado fishing lodge, with lots of hammered copper, rough-hewn wood shutters, barbwire-etched glass, and antler chandeliers. The cuisine can best be described as Southwestern comfort food with some very gourmet twists. The fondue is a shining example of the kitchen's creativity - a pot of silky-smooth, creamy-rich melted pepperjack cheese is accompanied by rosemary-garlic lamb chops, pistachio bread, and butternut squash for dipping. Other highlights are beef ribs braised in Dr. Pepper, pork shank slow-cooked in beer, and hickory-smoked salmon that tastes like it was grilled on a campfire. Green-chili macaroni and cheese is a house specialty, and deservedly one of the most popular items on the menu, as is the Big-Ass Burger piled high with toppings, but be forewarned - it's served only in the Saloon, which gets very rowdy, especially during happy hour. There's a patio with a fire pit that makes outdoor dining cozy on chilly evenings in the desert. Sadly, this isn't the five-star experience it should be - reservations appear to be meaningless, if the forty-five minute wait we had is any indication, service is abrupt and bordering on rude, and prices are considerably higher than they should be for what you get.

<review>This was an excellent night out we had  it just took me a while to get around to writing a short review.      The atmosphere here is king,  the steaks are yummy and the staff is excellent. \n\nJosh our waiter was there when we needed him and he gave great suggestions and took care of all the people at my table.    \n\nThe Mac and Cheese was my favorite,  make sure you try it.\n\nAdd this Sam Fox location to you list for Steaks.

<review>If I could marry soup, I would do it. I mean, I love soup more than life itself, and there are days when I have a soup that makes my husband come in a distant second (and I love HIM to pieces). This is how I feel when I order soup from Vermont Sandwich Company. Today's choices, Roast Beef Vegetable  and  Chicken Florentine were both fantastic. Yep, I orderd a cup of each instead of a soup and a sandwich...seriously, it's THAT FREAKING GOOD!\n\nThey make these soups fresh every day, so you call in the morning to find out what today's pot of gold will be. A few weeks ago, I called the day before and not only did they not know yet what the soups would be the next day, I GOT TO PICK THEM! Holy mother of Pearl, did that make me a happy girl! \n\nThe standard French Onion is incredible, but the potato leek or corn chowder are also fantastic. Heck, I haven't ordered a soup yet that didn't put me over the moon. In store one day, got to sample the Country Apple as well...(drool).\n\nAnd don't forget the cookies. Yep, Maple bacon...just saying.
</review>
<review>Kind of hidden back in the parking lot, but anyone who loves burgers and shakes and rock 'n roll, who danced the jitterbug and wore bobby socks and crinolines and tight sweaters will appreciate this place.  Juke box music and surley waiters  and  waitresses complete the picture.  This place gets 5 stars just on audacity.  I love it.  If I close my eyes I am taken back to the old drive-ins with the little trays that hooked on the car window and cute roller-skating cheerleader type waitresses who could balance 4 shakes, 2 soda pops  and  6 burgers  and  fries all on one little tray  . . . and it only cost $3.50.  Well, you won't find those prices here, but the rest of the history is here - on the walls, in the booths and music and most of all in the food.  Fast Eddie's is another time, another place, and another warm and fuzzy memory.
</review>
<review>So I have been here about 4 times and every time I go I have a good experience.  I would have to say they have some of the best bruschetta around and if you want brick oven pizza I would suggest this place over Pizzeria Bianco any day of the week...plus that there is never a two hour wait!\n\nI would say they are a bit pricey! But the food definitely doesn't make you feel cheated. And what I really like about the decor of this place  is the little veggies on the vine as you walk into the front door gives this place a cool vibe. Kind of a modern place. Like the lay out quite a bit. \n\nOnly down fall is the seats at the bar are not very comfortable and the do not have a foot rail so your kind of hanging there and the booths can be a bit small if your a big guy like me but that aside this place is the bomb.

<review>When Sen. Ken Cheuvront opened this restaurant, I was living in Midtown phoenix and it was at a time when a lot of restaurants in the area didn't exist. I was beyond excited of it's creation. \n\nIt's a very trendy urban feel, with a nice patio on Central Avenue. Located at the bottom of Artisan condos, it's not a terribly easy place to see if you're driving by. They feature an incredible selection of wines and cheeses, of which you can purchase and take home as well as nosh in the restaurant. They also feature smaller sized entrees for those who are not looking to get stuffed on greasy messes and feel sick all night.\n\nA particular favorite of mine are the ancho pork empanadas which are fluffy and crispy with a little orange in the pork. They are definitely delicious. Also great is their white pizza featuring sea scallops. \n\nThere is nothing here that is oddly unique, but everything is interesting, and it is a nice spot to hang out with friends and have a nice night out. Especially during a first friday.

<review>I love the cozy feel of Roaring Fork, but what's even better than the atmosphere is their incredible happy hour menu. I think they have one of the best happy hours in town, especially when they start their all-night happy hour during the summer months! That's right, I said all night happy hour! Their happy hour menu includes their signatures items including the pork stew, fish tacos and the Big Ass burger...and yes friends, it's truly a Big Ass Burger! Keep an eye on their updates because a little birdie told me that the all night happy hour is coming to town very soon!

<review>i stayed at the aloft tempe this past weekend for the p.f. changs rock n roll marathon/half marathon.  this is basically a poorman's w hotel.  it has a scaled down feel of a w hotel in every sense including the price.  \n\nthe staff is friendly, helpful and young.  i have to believe a majority of their staff goes to asu.  i asked the front desk for a recommendation on breakfast and her response was the starbucks and dennys across the street.  hmmm....thanks but i'll pass on dennys.  i should have asked the bartender as well just to see what she would have said.  \n\nthe rooms are nice and modern but not as flashy as a w hotel.  the rooms offer bliss toiletries, coffee maker, mini fridge (no mini bar) and several magazines.  \n\nthere is a starbucks, yogurtland and in-n-out across the street from this hotel for your dining pleasure if you are too lazy to drive anywhere.  oh, the dennys is just a little bit further away if you are wondering.
</review>
<review>OMG... I love this place! I'm not sure how long this place has been here but it's soooo awesome and the kicker is Z pizza is its neighbor and they are connected so you can grab a slice of pizza then go get ice cream or coffee or a latte. Simply fabulous for say a casual day time date the atmosphere is nostalgic and funky... oh and pink! Free wifi and cool tables and couches. Its places like this that are adding flavor to downtown phoenix where I just happen to live... Watch out mill avenue were coming for you in a bigger and better way!

<review>"""I really love this place.\nI wont go any where else for sushi, nothing tastes like it.\n$20 all you can eat sushi, green tea ice cream, miso soup, salad and edamame.\nIt's about 40 miles from my home and I try to go about once a month, if I lived closer, I'd go more often, it's that good.\n\nThe Owner Pancho is always so friendly and nice.\n\nThe only reason I gave 4 stars though, is because sometimes when it's busy the waiters/waitress aren't all that friendly and it takes them a while to get to our table, which is understandable, because I know how it is in the food business.\nBut about a year ago they all used to be really nice.\n\nGo there on your birthday, and they'll dim the lights, play cute \Happy Birthday\"""" music and let you blow out your candle on wasabi:)"""""""

<review>A mom and pop type of sandwich deli that has been around for many years.  You definitely won't get that chain feel like Subway, Quizno's, or Blimpie.  The owners are always so friendly and the prices are great.  Sandwiches are spectacular and I'm loving the location near Central Ave and Camelback, so much seems to be going on in this area. New restaurants and stores opening up all this time and I'm sure this place will be around for a while.  \n\nI'm getting hungry just thinking about the place!
</review>
<review>"""Taste: 5 stars.  The food here is delicious.  I have only eaten here once, but I went with a group of four, each of us ordering a separate dish.  We ordered the honey walnut shrimp, baby bok choy, some kind of chow mein (the name of it escapes me now), and a fish dish.  I opted out of the fish dish but everything else was exquisite and came in decent sized portions.  The honey walnut shrimp had decent sized pieces of shrimp that were cooked nicely.  They were a little tough for my preference now that I think back, but in no way did that impede my enjoyment of the dish.  The sauce spread over the shrimp was sweet but not too heavy and the walnuts were toasted to give an amazing counter balance to the texture of the shrimp.  The baby bok choy was made to perfection, and as a lover of garlic, the dish touched close to my heart with bits of friend garlic sprinkled on top, bursting with flavor that complimented the bok choy perfectly once mastication started in my mouth.  The chow mein was definitely something I was not used to.  The noodles were thinner, fried, and the vegetables on it were in a little bit of what looked like a starchy cream sauce.  A little bland to taste at first, I wasn't sure what to think of the dish, but the more I ate it, the more the \blandness\"""" turned into an appreciation for the different and simple components of the dish.  \n\nEveryone at my table was extremely happy and when we gave our compliments to our waiter, he informed us proudly that their chef was straight from Hong Kong.  He even told us a story about how the chef shakes his head in disappointment when people come in, requesting beef and broccoli and other dishes of the like.  Their response to these requests?  \""""There's a Panda Express down the street but if you want real Chinese food, then stay.\""""  \n\nService:  3.5 stars.  I'm kind of conflicted trying to score this.  The staff was very nice, the hostess and waiter were extremely polite and both were attentive and very helpful, but nothing seemed extraordinary.  Nothing really seemed to stand out as either good or bad.  They did their job and they did it well, but other than that, there was little interaction.  The best part about the service was the story our waiter told us at the end of our meal.  I really appreciated the interaction he finally gave us but it was after we had already paid.\n\nEnvironment:  3.5 stars.  The restaurant is very clean and is separated from the rest of the market enough that you feel like you are actually eating at a restaurant.  They did a great job making a restaurant in the corner of a supermarket but with the cooks tucked away in a room where you can't see them and only two people working the floor, I didn't get much from the environment of the place.  Maybe it was also because when we went, the restaurant was dead.  \n\nLee Lee's restaurant is a great place to grab a bite with friends.  I highly recommend going with friends so you can do what I did and split up dishes and taste multiple ones.  I hope that this place picks up in popularity.  The vast population of Caucasians in the greater Phoenix area should add a bit of culture into their lives and give this place a try.  All of the Americanized Asians (such as myself) and all other ethnicities should do the same. \n\nBecause the food was so great and that, quite frankly, is what is most important, I am going to round up for my final star total.  \n4 stars.\n\nOh one more note, they only accept Visa!"""""""

<review>I don't usually write reviews whether good or bad, but after my experience with Teri, I felt that it warranted me taking time to write a review.   I feel that good service should be rewarded with a good review.   I have been to many places for microdermabrasions, and Teri has by far been the best.  She took the time to discuss my skin, complexion, and products.  She explained each product she was using and also  sent me home with lots of samples.  I didn't feel like she was rushing through the treatment at all, I felt very pampered.  I have been to other places that rush through my treatment in 15 min.  With Teri, I was on the table for at least 90 min.   I found out about Teri through Groupon and her treatments are extremely affordable.  What usually is $60+ at Scottsdale salons is only $35 for her.   She works out of a cozy, clean room upstairs in Salon XL.  The aroma of the room is laced with lavender and peppermint tea tree oil.  I definitely would be recommending her to my friends.  Thanks so much Teri and I will be seeing you for future treatments!!!\n\nL. Smith

<review>If there was a half star, Centurion would get 4.5 stars.\n\nI was slightly skeptical at first when there was just the chef and waitress in the restaurant.  Considering this was a Saturday night, I thought I didn't get the memo that this was a lunch-oriented place and not the place to be for dinner.  I was so glad to be wrong, for once and only for once.\n\nThey warmly greeted us as we entered.  We were so hungry that we started out with their cheese plate.  It was a nice assortment of manchego, double-creamed brie, and since i mentioned I loved blue, the chef gave us their blue that was not even on the menu.  You get to choose 3 cheeses out of 6-9 choices.  The cheese plate was nicely arranged with fruits (grapes, strawberries) and nuts.  In addition, he added fig jam and Dijon mustard that gave it a nice kick.  Compared to other restaurants in the valley, it was one of the nicer cheese plates and selections.\n\nNext, on to 3 different kinds of risotto (coconut and shrimp, chorizo and manchego, white truffle), which were very rich.  The food just kept coming with our filet mignon, lamb, and halibut (entree for 2).  I know it was a lot of food for the 2 of us but I just had to try it all.  The filet mignon was good but although ordered rare, it was more on the medium rare side for me.  The sauce that was made for the lamb was fantastic; however, I've had a better cut of lamb.\n\nIt had a nice ambiance; however, the benches were very high and we had to move to another table.  Thankfully, the chef was aware of the issue and they are anticipating taking care of it.  The patio was really cute and inviting and will be a perfect place to grab a drink (once they get liquor license) after the weather becomes cool. \n\nThe chef was very personable and we will be back  to try his recommendation of the Espana pizza.  I hope others will try this place to keep it going because it's a wonderful independent restaurant that Phoenix needs!

<review>"""We were seated quickly even on a weekend night. The staff were friendly and attentive and the majority of whom were females wearing somewhat provocative white shirts bearing slogans such as \legalize marinara\"""" and \""""tastes like garlic.\"""" It kind of reminded me of the Italian food version of Hooters. \n\nFood and drinks arrived quickly and were good. Prices are a bit high for pizza and pasta, but the atmosphere made it enjoyable. They have a good selection of menu items which gives you lots of options. For dessert they have a pizza cookie topped with ice cream which is one of my favorites and reason enough to come here."""""""

<review>I've been in a lot of airports and PHX isn't too shabby. With high windows i was able to watch the sunset and planes taking off and landing. There are fairly good food options. I myself opted for California Pizza Kitchen and found the ~$11 personal pizza to be decent. Too bad the employees weren't as enjoyable as my pizza! I've never seen people move in such slow motion. The cheese topping on my pizza was probably drying up each passing moment! \n\nFree Wifi. Woo! That's a big thing if your overlay is at an airport. Other than people watching and eating expensive airport food, i like to browse the internet when i can!

<review>I am sorry Yelp, but Burritos are a food group! Especially for ME!\n\nI just starting working in the area and have been in search for a place for breakfast, lunch and good eats. So I went to my trusty Yelp app, and was not disappointed to find The Original Burrito Co.\n\nI have found my new Favorite Breakfast Burrito of all time! Number 12 Huevos Ala Mexicana: Eggs and some veggies and cheese. It is truly a well put together burrito, hits the spot every time. \n\nDon't forget the salsa! It is one of the top salsa's I have had!\n\nI have ordered a few more items off the menu and I have enjoyed them, but nothing as wonderful as the number 12!

<review>Echo is the neighborhood coffee shop I was waiting for. What I wasn't expecting was for it to become my neighborhood lunch spot as well. I'm stuck on the Cubano. It is all kinds of yummy roast pork and stuff. Since I can't break away from that, my wife tried the Mediterranean Tuna sandwich and it was so good that we split sammiches next time.\n\nKeep up the good work, Echo. You definitely deserve the following you're garnering. Plus, I'm glad to see that building put to some good use. Hopefully some other quality businesses will fill in the open spot(s) and we'll have even more reason to make it a destination. A kickass Mexican market would be awesome. There is definitely both the Hispanic and Gringo crowd to support it in the area.\n\nAs for the lack of free refills... doesn't that imply that if I didn't drink 1 gallon of tea that I got ripped off? What about all of us 1 big beverage drinkers who are satisfied with the price we pay for our 1 drink. Are we supposed to feel stupid for not maximizing our liquid intake? To me, free refills make sense if you're at a sit-down place that is primarily about food and you're going to be there a longish time due to the food service. For a place that is primarily a coffee/beverage spot with some good food, allowing people to sit and drink free drinks all day would be a bad business decision. If you disagree, open up the Free Refills joint next door. Prove me wrong.\n\nPerhaps a compromise is to add a discounted refill to the menu. That will please the regulars who hang out and abuse the T3 and serve those who suck down lots of liquids in a short time.\n\n(a T3/DS3? really? i have my doubts that an entire T3/DS3 is being dedicated to this shop. that's enough bandwidth to serve a good-sized office building and host some websites with good traffic. a simple Cox cable connection is a fraction of the cost and often far faster.)

<review>Lee Lee is a fish scented heaven.  After a few kinks and months of anticipation, they finally opened on the corner of 75th Avenue and Cactus, across the street from the lovely Pholicious.\n\nThe soft opening appeared to go off well.  They're currently in the process of putting together two in-house restaurants and I'm excited to try them.  I suspect reviews are forthcoming.\n\nMy biggest issue with Lee Lee is the organization.  The aisles are set up by county and that can lead to a bit of confusion when looking for specific products.  Where is the coconut milk?  Why, it's not in the tea and bottled/canned beverage section with the other canned milks.  It's not in the generic canned stuff area.  After a bit of searching, I discovered it's housed with the Thai foods.  This example holds true for many products and can leave one scrambling in circles, attempting to muddle through the organizational logic.\n\nDespite the flaws, Lee Lee is amazingly beautiful.  Moving into an old Albertsons, it's immaculate and exactly what this neighborhood needed.

<review>A recent addition to our dining pantheon, Liberty Market has yet to serve us something we weren't impressed with. In the few months since they have been open, (October 2008), we have been back numerous times for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.\n\nTheir menu is still evolving and a few new items are added from time to time. This is a major plus for any restaurant keeping the choices changing and the menu fresh.\n\nThey have a wonderful selection of breakfast items and baked goods all with a bit of a twist to them that you are sure to enjoy.\n\nLunch and dinner feature pressed sandwichwes with fresh ingredents like arugula, basil, fontina and gorgonzolla cheese, balsamic viniger and some of the finest meats to be found on fresh made daily breads. Their wood fired pizza oven puts forth the best pies you'll find this side of Italy with a wonderful crust that is both crunchy and toothful.\n\nThe finest carrot cake around for dessert and truly fine coffee. Not to mention the best bowl of hot chocolate on the planet, made from scratch not a can of syrup. Yum!\n\nYou owe it to your self to give Liberty Market a try, your tounge and your tummy will thank you.

<review>Solid Pho and spring rolls at the usual low low price. I stopped in yesterday for takeout and got beef pho with meatballs, spring rolls, and a Thai iced tea all for about $11. The Pho came with the usual toppings, all very fresh and plentiful. The spring rolls were big and packed with noodles, shrimp, and beef. My only complaint was that the iced tea was so sweet I'm pretty sure all of my teeth started to rot right there; I couldn't finish it. But I think that's just a personal preference. \n\nNo complaints about the food or price, and the staff was friendly. Clean enough place, I would eat there.

<review>"""I went to this place this morning (Saturday) around 9:30am w/ a few of my friends. This place was really busy, people waiting outside (10+ people) consistently. (Always a good sign to a great food joint). So I put my name in at the door and we waited 25 or so to be seated. No problem. The people were all in good moods and atmosphere outside was really nice. (They had a few cement benches outside for those who wanted to sit--only wish they had misters!) So when they called your name, they wouldn't just say \party of 3\"""" or something they would say \""""Sarah...are you ready to eat!?!\"""" It was kind of funny. We entered this small restaurant and the tables had a nice retro feel to them and it was really bright and sunny. On the walls were decorated w/ Disney art (Snow White being my favorite), the Simpson's and other fun characters. We sat down and were greated rather quickly, but within 2 mins they came back and asked if we were ready...we were like 'whoa!' we haven't even had a chance to review all the options (omlettes, egg sandwiches, french toast, chicken fried steak ,eggs of course, granola/yogurt..the list goes on...). So we made our decisions, and I ended up getting the \""""The Mile High - Ham  and  Bell pepper with diced onions and cheddar cheese\"""" (subsititute - just egg whites) with wheat toast. My friend I believe got the Wolf Pack (eggs, hashbrowns, toast etc) and then my other friend got the Chilaquiles - a mixture of tortillas, ranchero sauce, chicken, sour cream   and  cheddar cheese topped with one egg. All looked mighty delish. \n\nMy omelette was so butter-delish and had all the right textures, and flavors you could want. The peppers added bold flavor without adding too many calories, the ham and cheese added just enough salt it make perfect. The toast was normal wheat toast, so not much 'wow' there. But complemented the omelette very nicely. \n\nI would highly recommend this place, I am definitely going back. Just leave plenty of time to wait. (As stated--this happens at any good breakfast spots on a Sat./Sun morning). But they seem to move people in and out rather quickly. Speaking of which....it appears my group of friends over stayed our welcome. After about an hour of us chatting girls, the waiter got a bit upset I think because he couldn't turn the table. I guess we should of been more courteous to the others outside waiting in the heat...but we just liked the atmosphere and company so much...we faltered. Please forgive us 'Over Easy' and when we come back...we'll try to not talk to much. :o)"""""""

<review>"""Now that I've dined here twice... I'm gonna hold Petite Maison at 4 stars. \n\nMonday night, 7:30 - my reservation got my party of 2 the last table in the place. (Whew. it's so small in there.) The service was fantastic, although it's so odd to go to a full restaurant and be given so much time to have a leisurely meal... especially when they're full. For example, after the hostess sat us and gave us our menus, about 2 minutes later the waiter came by and after doing his introductory speech, said he would give us a few more minutes to become familiar with the menu... lol... I was ready to give my drink order, but okay! We also had to request the bill. I am pretty sure they would have let us linger with our coffee for a full hour if we'd wanted to :O   Really weird not to be rushed out! \n\nOh, onto the food! The most important part! \nMy friend ordered the escargot, which, since i'm very \meh\"""" on escargot, I can't tell you if they were good or not even though I had two of them at my friend's prompting. She also had the trout almondine  - omg fantastic, I'd order it next time. Whatever dressing they had the salad greens and green beans in, was incredible, and I don't even care for green beans, but YUM... I ordered the house salad and the foie gras. The foie gras was very good, certainly the rarest I've ever had it served. I'm not sure how I feel about the accoutrements - the vinegary accent sauce, the pickled grapes, the roasted apples, on top of a (I felt, a little burned) piece of brioche. I've had better combinations with foie gras, to be honest. But it was still good enough that I ate the whole thing. The salad was also good, I really enjoyed the roasted shallot vineagrette, but to be honest it felt like the salad was missing something... not perfectly seasoned, to my tastes, I think it needed a little salt. :( \n\nThe chocolate creme brulee was also my friend's choice (I'd have tried the souffle if it had been up to me!). The creme brulee was good - even great - but I'm a traditionalist, and while delicious, I prefer non-chocolated-up brulees :) PS - Do not attempt to eat the candied orange garnish on top of the creme brulee. LOL \n\nAll in all, despite a few very minor concerns about my meal, I'll be back. The bottom line is, the price is right (It's amazing how cheap we got outta there, really), the service is fantastic, the atmosphere is cute and cozy, and the food is pretty great. Solid 4 stars. Next time, I'm thinking that flat iron steak."""""""

<review>I almost feel like I am cheating, but as someone who has been going to YC's for 15 years, and has done her best to stay true to them as their veggies got limp, the floors got dirty, and the staff got sweatier, I just can't do it anymore, not with this hot new Mongolian Grill around the corner. This place takes it to a whole new level, and its so clean, and so many options, nothing can compete...then you throw a $2 pint happy hour special in there and yeah, sorry YCs...can we still be friends?

<review>Love the feel, vibe of Johnny Rockets.  Just has something different, like that vintage feel, we ate at the counter and enjoyed the classic music and oldies.  My 9 year old son enjoyed the theme and I am sure some of us older folk could enjoy the nostalgic feel of the place.\nAs for the food, just burger and fries cooked on a flat grill right in front of you.  Just a simple burger and has that just fresh taste to it.  Love the chocolate cokes they offer as well.\nService was above normal as most of the staff was friendly and in good spirits, singing along to the songs and enjoying the atmosphere.  I would say this is an excellent place for kids since I saw so many children here.

<review>"""If I ever have the urge to spend more money on bedding than the current value of my house, this is the place to do it.  I actually learned of The Linen Tree when they were listed as a retailer of Molton Brown bath products on another website.  My first impression was not the best, however.\n\nWhen I could not find a product on their website, I asked via on-line chat which was supposedly \open.\""""  No one answered.  No worries, I emailed instead.  Again, I never received a response.  At that point I decided if they could not respond to a shampoo inquiry, I would never buy my next set of $777 bath towels here either.  And so I purchased the shampoo from Saks.  And for all you haters that now think I can only use the finest shampoo, it was not for me.  It was for my husband.  And any time a man is interested in any product related to hygiene, I recommend you ladies support him...no matter the cost.  The opposite extreme is far more costly.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks and I need drawer sachets as a gift.  So I did the unthinkable and went back to TLT when I struck out elsewhere.  And I am now in love with that store!  Kind of luck my husband.   Didn't care for him at first, but he grew on me.  In a good way, not like a tumor.  Anywho, what I found at TLT was a beautiful selection of all things bed and bath...linens, lovely soaps and bath products, accessories, and my drawer sachets.  There's also a nice selection of china, table linens and pretty decorative items.  As for the staff, they were very polite and helpful.  I'm only knocking a star for the rocky start.\n\nTLT will definitely be on my list for gift items.  Maybe I'll even treat myself occasionally, too!"""""""

<review>"""It was windy  and  rainy this morning, as I was out running errands.  I realized that it was just the right weather for some great Mexican food, so I whipped in here to Juan's for a second visit!\n\nNow if it's a torta you want, there's no substitute for Los Reyes de la Torta, but for a regular Mexican menu, I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Here are a few points from my experience today:\n\n*  Super comfortable atmosphere due to window free dining room with just-right lighting  and  acoustics!  Yes, the place is busy...  Yes, there are lots of kids.  No, nothing will interfere with your comfort, especially in any one of the booths lining both available walls.  The \vibe\"""" is just perfect here!\n\n*  Their extensive, easy to understand menu gives you plenty of Combination choices,  and  at low prices!\n\n*  The chips are terrific,  and  the delicious salsa is just hot enough.  ... And yes, they're free!  (Yes, some Mexican places are charging for chips now!  Can you imagine?)\n\n*  I have been waited on by \""""Crystal\"""" both times that I've been here,  and  received extra friendly, \""""just right\"""" service!\n\nI had a #14 Combo today ($7.29), which included a Chile Relleno (made with a Big Jim New Mexico Chile), a shredded beef taco, generous servings of refried beans  and  cheese topped Spanish Rice,  and  three hot corn tortillas rolled up in foil on the side.  The food here is a little fiesty overall, but not super hot,  and  it's all delicious.\n\nThis is a restaurant where everything is right!     :-))"""""""

<review>I'll have to admit, being a non-smoker, I wasn't sure how much i'd appreciate the joint.  That said, I thought the lounge was a great addition to the old-town scene. \n\nThe number one reason for this Yelp review is the ice-ball. If you don't know, ask the bartender on duty to add one to your cocktail....and it will make your night. Even coming straight from the sports bar scene in khakis and a tank top, I felt welcomed and appreciated at this bar, which seems to cater to all types....both members and non alike.\n\nThe staff was top notch -- not too stuffy or self-serving, and I enjoyed the time I spent there. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the great patio area and the live Jazz I saw setting up as I left.\n\nI think as soon as more of Scottsdale finds out about this gem, they're going to make it seriously uninhabitable for the likes of me. But if that's their only problem....I think I'll be able to make the occasional exception.

<review>so after having lived in the phoenix area for 2 years, i decided it was high time to finally see some of the restaurants everyone raves about.   This was the first restaurant i was told to try and boy was it amazing.   The wait was crappy but my friend and i just brought something to occupy our time.   Since we are medical students we had plenty of notes to keep us busy. nonetheless, we decided to see what the wine bar was like next door and a couple of glasses of wine later we are all giggles and boy talk.  3 hours later (which is a bit too much in my final opinion) we were seated at the bar and promptly ordered.   We shared an appetizer, spiedini (Italian fontina wrapped in prosciutto with arugula greens) and it was fantastic!! the cheese was perfectly melted and cut by the salty prosciutto and peppery arugula.  As for the pizzas, we each ordered a pizza knowing that we would have leftovers to take home.  I choose the Wise Guy mainly for the fennel sausage and it was worth it!  The pizza crust was amazing, super fresh cheese and the onions were caramelized perfectly.  My friend decided on the Rosa, which she really enjoyed, although we both agreed it was incredibly greasy.   All in all, a fun night away from studying, but is it worth 3 hours of smelling pizza and being starved while you wait? ....That's your call, but i will say it's the best pizza I've ever had in the US and almost as good as the pizza i had in Spain.

<review>We here for my first time yesterday with my mother who has been several times and has nothing but good things to say. \n\n1. SERVICE - everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, down to the super friendly valet! \n\n2. The facility and grounds were so clean and smelled amazing. Great clean up crew :) \n\n3. The rooftop pool was AMAZING. The pool was not overly chlorinated and it felt like there was water softener which made it so nice to swim in. \n\n4. The whole experience was quiet and relaxing and my masseuse with Linda was great. She was friendly, considerate, and STRONG. :)
</review>
<review>This was my first time for Boba! YAY BOBA!!\n\nIt was surprisingly good!  I ordered a green tea with milk and sugar syrup with regular boba....I Loved the flavor of the tea and the boba was cool, chewy like a gummy bear but doesn't stick to your teeth.\n\nCute and comfy atmosphere with a ton of different ways to order your boba. They also have  a small food menu which I didn't look at but saw what people were eating and it looked pretty good.\n\nAnd if you've gotten a little tipsy after all your Boba drinking they even have a karaoke machine!\n\nI can't wait to go back!
</review>
<review>This is my shop for routine service for my truck. I always get the feeling they are being up front and honest, and they have never tried to push unnecessary service on me. Prices are fair for an independent shop.\n\nThey do have a waiting area, but you may need to wait to have service done if they have other cars ahead of you. I live close enough that I can just walk home, but they do offer a shuttle if you need it. If you're in a hurry (say need the oil changed, but only have 30 minutes to get it done), best call ahead.

<review>Supherb Moving Company!!!  Brandon was a great mover and made my move stress free and efficient.  He showed up on time, and began working quickly.  It was by far the fastest and easiest move I have ever had.  His positive attitude and knowledge of moving made things move seamlessly.  I will definitely be using his moving services in the future and would highly recommend that anyone use this moving company for their future moves.  Thank you Brandon, for making my move, so smooth.

<review>Oh how I love Dim Sum!  If you feel the same I would recommend you folks attend Great Wall.   It's hard to find good Dim Sum around the valley, but I believe Great Wall is definitely one of those gem of a place we should appreciate for Dim Sum.  Decor is your typical large Chinese restaurant look - red, gleamy gold and x-mas lights here and there.  Don't forget the fish tank too; no! it's not a decoration, you pick a fish and they cook it!  You know a good Chinese restaurant for Dim Sum when you go and you feel like you're in Chinatown - Enjoy!

<review>"""My friend and I were out and about on the town, and we were looking for a great place to hang out. Someplace fun, not pretentious, definitely not douchy. \n\nWe hopped on Yelp and found SideBar. Both of us live in Scottsdale, and I am the first to admit that I am used to living in my bubble of Old Town.\n\nThe moment you walk into SideBar, you are sent into an era of awesome. You walk up a killer staircase, and you can smell the booze and good times that await you. My first comment to my friend was, \Well, it smells like a bar.\"""" In a good way.\n\nOnce you get to the top of the staircase, you are greeted by a giant light board. It's pretty spiffy.\n\nClearly, they showcase local artists. Always a plus. You can explore the walls and find some interesting work.\n\n Have a nice craft beer selection (bottles), and if you are a fan of different liquors, the bar is well-stocked.\n\nThe crowd is quite eclectic. All walks of life here. The douchy pretentious guy. The DJ who is off work, hammered and wearing a fro. Artsy girls who are cute. You get it all here.\n\nWe sat at the bar, and were able to talk without being drowned out by horrible music. The stools were unique. Everything seems Ikea-esque, but who cares....it's a fun place to hang out.\n\nThere are plenty of couches.\n\nDrinks are cheap. Beer was $5 and they didn't charge for the diet coke we ordered. Although....it came in a red party cup. Almost knocked it down a star for not putting it in a collins glass. I asked one of the barbacks for a glass, and he happily obliged.\n\nFor the record, this is my first venture to the \""""west\"""" side of town. I want to come back!"""""""

<review>I typically do not favor subs at all or crave them to say the least. I do not know how jimmy johns stays in business for example. The only thing decent there in my opinion is their bread which is not even phenomenal. Ned's Subs are up there with subway in my book.  Their Chicken sandwich tasted exceptionally fresh(my best word to describe the taste). I like Fresh things so works out perfect for me!\nWe had stopped here randomly because we had thought the name was funny as we were driving through the parking lot looking for harbor freight.  Next time i am around this area i will again make my stop to try a totally different sub and then onto some fro-yo!\n\n:)

<review>This is authentic Mexican Food.  I've been in Phoenix since 1963 and think most of the great Mexican restaurants are long gone. But, the beef tacos at Armando's are the best in town, in my humble opinion.  They are wonderful homemade shredded Angus beef served sizzling hot, so hot they sometime melt the plate.  They are dressed with copious amounts of shredded yellow and white cheese and shredded lettuce.  The salsas served at the side bar are homemade and delicious with a nice kick. The red is awesome!  Even the beans are the perfect texture and consistency, well refried but firm and not watery or cooked to mush.\n\nThey serve a wide variety of Mexican favorites, including tasty fish tacos, adovada, carnitas, and even menudo (Sunday's).  The cheese enchiladas are worth writing home about with a fresh red sauce.  Mouth watering!  The combination plates I've tried have all been great and come laden with high quality food. They have a daily $5 special combo that is always pleasing.  But, on days when the beef taco combo is the $5 special, I feel like I won the lottery.\n\nAll the food seems made onsite with care.  Its also fast and cheap!  Armandos is open 24 hours and always seems to have steady traffic, but ive never seen it crowded or had to wait long for my meal.  \n\nThe decor is fifties Dairy Queen type chairs and tables with some booths, and tired, but kept very clean.  Armando's may not be pretty but it's about the food. Often you'll catch a whiff of bleach which seem kind of reassuring in what could be considered a bit of a dive.  But ignore the surrounding and scarf down a beef taco or three, and you'll know what I mean.

<review>This store in my eyes is the Ralph's that I am used to in California. This is your one stop shop for a good amount of your daily needs. There is a gas station, pharmacy, bank, red box, bakery, florist, butcher all in this one location and the prices are amazing. The lines here are short which is a relief coming from California's line ridden grocery stores. There are four self check out registers and at least six assisted check out lines. Customer service is key at this location with a greeter at the front door and employees walking around trying to assist you in any way possible.

<review>"""My wife and I ate at this place while visiting family. We saw it had great reviews and the locals liked it too so we tried it. It was definitely worth all the hype. It was delicious and seemed authentic since it was owned and run by a Polish family. When you ask customers there what's good, they say everything so it's sure to be great and it was!!! We tried the \My Big Fat Polish Sausage Sandwich\"""" and one of their soup of the days which had spinach, carrots, and potatoes with a hard boiled egg. It was delicious."""""""

<review>"""I have gone here a couple of times for a pregame to events at US Airways Center.  This time was no exception. \n\nI would describe the place as a upscale sports bar.  The service was great, I always had something to drink and the food has always been tasty.\n\nI had the Buffalo chicken wrap with French fries. I would definitely order this again! It was absolutely delicious!!  I also had a spicy bloody mary which was standard, as well as some mimosas.  The mimosas were delicious and came with a mini bottle of champagne in its own little \ice bucket\"""".  Which was just one part of an ice shaker with the mini bottle nestled inside, but it was genius :)\n\nThe happy hour looked nice but was not valid during event nights, which was disappointing.  I will definitely visit again :)"""""""

<review>I happen to really like this place for breakfeast. I have been going to this location  and the other location for years and always happy with my meal. I used to get the Bubbas Benny which is biscuits and gravy with eggs and potatoes. But now they make it with turkey sausage so I dont get it anymore. Now I get the eggs benidict. Its good and the hollandaise sauce doesnt have a lot of lemon in it. Im not a fan of lots of lemon in my hollandaise. The waffles and french toast here are good as well. This place has burgers, salads, and sandwiches to. Prices are good. $5-10. I dont think they have anything over $10 on the menu.
</review>
<review>We have been eating here for about 4 years and I have honestly never had a bad experience whether dining in or taking food to go.  I'll admit that I'm very much a creature of habit. I'll usually get the same thing. My husband, however, has tried different dishes and I've enjoyed those as well.  \n\nDine in experience is always pleasant and service is great.  This is the happiest we've been since we don't have the Chinatown from home to enjoy.
</review>
<review>ok, on those nights that you really don't feel like going downtown, but still wanna go somewhere to chill with friends, this place is PERFECT!  whats not to love about the sweet margs, cheap beer, and awesome happy hour specials!   the chicken dip is absolutely amazing!   We used to come here for dinner once a week also, but since they took the stuffed poblano off them menu, we really only come for drinks and apps.  the employees are so much fun and the whole atmosphere just makes you forget your stress.. or was it all those delicious strawberry margs?...   hmm :)

<review>"""The name \Dick's Hideaway\"""" is an understatement! This is as hidden as a restaurant can get. Hole in the wall? Yes! \n\nI was Yelping around on Saturday morning looking for somewhere to eat in AZ that wasn't a chain. Challenging task, I know. I needed something that reminded me of home. Something with character and culture. This is when my prayers were answered and I stumbled upon rave reviews of this adequately named establishment. Chile Adovada on their brunch menu? Surely I wasn't in Scottsdale anymore... this sounded like heaven to me! I could hardly contain my excitement when we finally entered this humble abode of brunch delight! At last- I found a joint that didn't resemble a Denny's or Ihop. I was delighted to say the very least. My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito and I of course had to get the Chile Adovada. It was pure bliss. The plate was large enough to feed 2 but I was starving. Every bite was out of this world! I could talk about the food for hours but let me move on to the ambiance. It was about as cool as the food. I felt like I was part of a club or something of that nature. There are no signs on the door advertising the place so it felt a little secretive. Pretty cool huh! The staff was super friendly and inviting. I topped off my weekend brunch with a small glass of jalapeno infused tequila. Careful if you don't like spicy flavors! If you like heat as much I do though, you will love it! \nI will definitely be back at Dick's again soon! \nCiao!"""""""

<review>I've been going to Lifequest for several years now. I went in because I had carpal tunnel so bad it was debilitating. I could barely work. Even brushing my hair could shoot pain down my arms. I didn't even consider the neck and back pain that I had when I went in. Just thought that was normal.\nAfter an initial period of frequent visits to fix everything, I now just go there every other week for maintenance. It feels so good to take care of myself. The staff is great, and they also have a few massage therapists in office.
</review>
<review>I hesitate to write a true review for this place as I have only been there for the grand opening.  I'm not sure if the free food buffet they had was a true sample of their menu or not.  I was impressed by the variety of food they had available, most notably the Teriyaki beef which is among the best I have ever tasted.  Growing up in Hawaii this is no small feat... I used to live off of the stuff.  They also had some interesting drinks available at the bar, including a sparkling sake beer (that is the only way I can think to describe it) that was quite addicting.
</review>
<review>Stopped in Kitchen Switchin'  to see what it was all about.  What a great idea - a specialty consignment shop just for kitchen stuff.  Love it!\n\nThe staff in the store were friendly and welcoming.  They have a ton of kitchen items - just about everything you can think of, even a collection of cookbooks.   The are a consignment shop so you can bring in your unwanted kitchen items and maybe even pick up a thing or two that you don't have.  Their prices are right too.  Some consignment shops I've been to have such high prices you start to wonder why you'd buy their previously owned items.  Not this place - they have good quality items and the prices are fair.  \n\nIf you have a kitchen gadget addiction or are just looking for a thing or two stop by and check it out.

<review>"""Had a meeting at Scratch yesterday and I'm in love. I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu items! And especially their desserts...the case full of enticing treats was almost more than I could stand! :)\n\nThe whole place was just adorable. I loved the \girly-girl\"""" meets \""""Retro punk rock\"""" vibe. Who knew something so cute and trendy existed between Subway and Fry's!\n\nThe iced mocha I had was great, but their selection of teas and coffees was huge. And their menu looked fabulous. I wasn't too hungry, so I tried the crepes, which were delicious. The food the two gals I was with looked amazing though. \n\nDefinitely a \""""must go back to\""""!"""""""

<review>What a wonderful building inside and out, a little difficult for some handicaps but manageable.\n\nWe had season tickets here as well as several other venues around town.  Most of the productions were pretty good and enjoyable. Some of the shows particularly one person shows the sound was not too good and hard to hear all that was going on. We did give up our tickets for a couple of reasons, one being the seats are just too close together, another was the folks sitting in front of us and to the right would never shut up and the guy behind me would fall asleep about fifteen minutes in and start snarking and snorting. Why do these folks waste the money and enjoyment of others acting like this? But the building remains a gem.
</review>
<review>Tiny tacos. Delicious, delicious tiny tacos. That's all you need to know! \n\nWe were starved for food, and Mexican sounded amazing. A quick Yearch (Yelp search, eh? Eh?) brought this place up...right down the street! Sold!\n\nOur server was super friendly and knowledgable about the menu, if not a *little* absent. It's a good thing we weren't in a rush. We passed the time by watching the Denver Tebows implode so all was well. \n\nI opted for the 2 taco meal, where you chose from a list of about 15 types of street tacos and rice and beans. I love that you get the option of corn or flour tortillas and black or refried beans. I got a mixed veggie taco and a Pappas con Queso taco. Both were delicious and the black beans were super tasty as well. The regular salsa was pretty standard (but good) and the tomatilla salsa was smoky perfection. (Chips and salsa don't come automatically--but are free if you ask!)\n\nAll in all, I'm SO glad I know about Cien Agaves! It wil become a staple!

<review>"""An Asian grocery the size of a Wal-Mart is pretty awe-inspiring all by itself, but there's really much, much more to Lee Lee than aisles of noodles and spices and lentils and rices (though they do have these as well, in spades, as well as all the requisite weird seafood and meat products that make Asian groceries so damn fun). \n\nThere's so much happening at Lee Lee, I go into a daze every time I enter. Seriously, my boyfriend has to herd me around, lest I spend 45 minutes choosing frozen Indian breads. (Paratha? Naan? Batura? Roti? Garlic, onion or plain?) Or trying to justify purchasing five pounds of lamb. Or considering the merits of roast duck. \n\nAnyway, before I get sidetracked again, let's start where I always do -- the booze aisle. Lee Lee carries a wide variety of Asian beers, of course, plus some good sakes and plum wines. But there's always at least one too-good-to-be-true booze selection. Yesterday it was a half case of Widmer Hefeweizen for $6.88. I've also purchased Konig Ludwig Bavarian weissbier for $2.99 a six-pack, Carlsberg Elephant beer for $9.99 a case, Warsteiner mini-kegs for $7.99 and countless other delights at \fell off a truck somewhere\"""" prices. \n\nIf that's not enough to get you to brave Lee Lee's jacked-up parking lot and hordes of chattering families of all ethnicities (united only by an uncanny ability to get in your way), consider this: Lee Lee is also home to aisles of non-Asian delights, like Jamaican jerk sauce and Mexican spices. And of course, my favorite -- the lovingly labeled \""""Holland foods\"""" section. I don't .know why it's there, but  I do know that pickled herring is fucking delicious.\n\nBy the time I leave, my cart invariably looks like the shopping list for a dinner party at the United Nations.\n\nA very drunken dinner party."""""""

<review>You drive up and toss the keys to the valet while experiencing the heady mouth-watering aroma of cooking meat.\n\nThen as you walk up the trail to the front door your nose is assaulted with the other kind of meat: alive and pooping in a pen. Dang, that  bull had the biggest antlers I've ever seen - oh, like I know what  you call those pointy things. Upon entering you're offered a choice: stairs or slide. The 11 kids in our party uniformly opted for the slide. Over and over and over again. So did most of the moms. The 2 dads and one boyfriend all stuck with the stairs.\n\nThe family style pork ribs were great. And can I have two of those delish Margies, rocks with salt, plskthx? Nummers.\n\nThe establishment itself was gracious to the point of absurdity. We had a 5.30pm reservation for a party of 22. Due to bad traffic, getting lost, missing turns, and just general bad planning, half of us were 45 minutes late. On Valentine's Day, no less! And we were the early ones! The other half of us arrived another hour later. Half of those in our party were girls between the ages of 6 and 14 and no one batted an eye. (And yes, now you all know how pitiful my life is that I spent Valentine's Day with a giant group of kids.)\n\nThe band was excellent. The dancing was fun to watch but I'd never participate due to my 17 left feet. The only thing I'd change were the gray mealy beans.\n\nGreat place to greet then eat your meat.

<review>"""If you were one of the many like me that used to make the pilgrimage to Bruchi's CheeseSteaks in Ahwatukee, you were probably also disappointed when you arrived that one day to find them out of business.\n\nFor years following their closure I sampled cheesesteaks here and there, but none of them even came close to the taste of what Bruchi's delivered.\n\nThen a co-worker introduced me to Forefathers Gourmet Cheesesteaks  and  Fries in Tempe and I struck gold. These guys can really turn out a great sandwich.\n\nMy favorite is the #2 Cheesesteak (with grilled onions and white American cheese). The regular size is more than enough to satisfy most appetites, but if you are really hungry go for the large. The fresh baked Italian bread is great and they offer a variety of different flavor cheesesteaks to choose from.\n\nIf you do a combo meal with regular fries, be sure to get some \fry sauce\"""" near the soda dispenser for something a little different.\n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone out there who loves a good cheesesteak.

<review>"""It's actually \Winkles Field at Packard Stadium at Brock Ballpark\"""".  I guess it's hard to choose between big-money donors and important historical figures. If I give them some money, will they name the batter's box after me?\n\nI really like coming to ballgames here.  It's a very pretty park, simple amenities, and ASU is solid on the baseball fundamentals, something you don't get in a lot of big league games.  (What's it worth to you to be able to see the rightfielder back up first base on a throw from the left side of the diamond? Priceless...) And best of all, there's plenty of elbow room, something that Cubs fans can't claim as they cram into Ho Ho Kam park a few miles away every spring. Fewer than 4000 seats.\n\nThe seats are old-school, which translates to \""""really uncomfortable\"""", which means you better bring a good cushion if you want to actually stay nine innings.\n\nMy favorite detail: the sign in front telling patrons that \""""No Pitchforks\"""" are allowed in the park."""""""

<review>Culver's gets five stars on their custard alone. If you've never had it before, if it's done right, frozen custard is like the richest, creamiest ice cream you've ever had. \n\nBeing MN/WI transplants, the boyfriend and I were quite excited when Culver's opened up in AZ and have since introduce many friends to the joy that is frozen custard. Now, in WI frozen custard is quite common and Culver's actually lands towards the bottom of the list for custard places. But here in AZ, Culver's shoots right to the top. \n\nThey have a nice variety for their flavors of the day and if you're not into that you can make your own sundae. They have shakes too and in the fall they have a pumpkin pie shake that is the best thing in the world. it really tastes like pumpkin pie in a cup.\n\nTheir burgers are good, not my favorite. Surprisingly they have really good salads - I know, right? The boyfriend loves the cashew chicken salad and I adore the strawberry salad. \n\nThey also have cheese curds which is great when I need a little bite of home.\n\nTheir staff is usually very friendly too, which is a nice change from some fast food places where they barely say hello to you.\n\nSo grab your Packers jacket and head over to Culver's for some dairyland delight.

<review>I don't eat sushi but my Grandfather does. And I take him out for his 87th birthday here on a recommendation. He was so happy here.\n\nThey were so kind to us. They didn't mind me yelling because my Grandfather couldn't hear me otherwise. They didn't mind me constant requests and they even served him up some ice cream and make sure we had everything we needed without fail.\n\nSo nice. Would be back... you know, if I ate sushi (hey... I'm a vegetarian!)

<review>Today our boss took our department out for lunch at l and l. There are many great looking items on the menu I had a hard time choosing. There was however one that stuck out from a triple d episode. I ordered the loco moco and it was darn good. It's a bed of rice with a ground beef patty on top with 2 over easy eggs and gravy above that. On first bite you pop the egg open over the meat and rice and just get this layered goodness. It was a great lunch. I totally want to go back to try their other items but at least this one was great.

<review>I'm a fan!  Acacia Cafe has won my Sunday morning breakfast-eating heart.  I love the the fresh fluffy omelets...light and tasty with fresh crisp veggies and light, nutty, buttered-to-perfection toast that is lined with sunflower and pumpkin seeds...mmmm mmmm.   I'm not sure if the packaged jelly's on the table are their own but they sure taste like it, not too sweet like most commercial types. I've also had their sandwiches  and  salads and you cannot go wrong with those either.  This place is a must visit if you want a yummy, fresh meal at a decent price.  The service can be a bit flaky, but I'm willing to overlook as long as the food keeps coming out hot, fresh and yummy.  Beware, if you sit inside you may smell like breakfast all day...might  be okay if you like that sort of thing.  :)

<review>I first came here as a part of a class trip. We all enjoyed ourselves and feasted on the new and different cuisne that is Thai food. It was here that I first met and fell inlove with Pad Thai. \n\nIt was so wonderfully prepared and delicious. I decided I needed to come back someday for more. And when that day finally came, I needed the navagator feature on my cell phone to get there! This place is really hard to find! so keep your eyes peeled and know that's in the depths of a strip mall. \n\nThe pad thai was just as good as I remembered it. However, they did serve me bad shrimp. It even smelled bad! I didn't want to eat it. But I took it home to be polite. The deserts are good as well. The coconut ice cream topped with peanuts is surprising to say the least! \n\nI say, go! but take a map! Or a navagator if you have it. And be ready to be doted on, but don't expect any free refils on your soda! (boo!) and have a nice time with some nice people eating great authentic food. It was truely a great experience! :)

<review>Never has my hair been in better hands! Just when I thought my hair couldn't look any better, I am always so pleased to learn that yes, as a matter of fact it does every single time I leave Hair Nirvana. Vee is a master at his craft! \n\nAfter sharing with Vee (My Hair Stylist) my traumatizing story of hair disasters, I saw Vee listening attentively to every word I said. I explained that since my hair had to be cut so short last time from a previous Stylist's disaster approximately 6 years ago because an undisclosed Stylist was not  being extremely careful to lift my hair color from mousy brown to blond! And so Vee and I's journey began about  6 years ago.\n\n Vee, my Stylist really listened attentively and saw my vision of having  beautiful long, silky, golden blond hair (as Vee has achieved). This vision has come true with Vee's patience, and understanding that each strand of my hair must be treated ever so delicately, because it takes years to grow back, so I have no room for error. \n\nHair Nirvana has a mysterious Zenlike feel to it! When you walk in you are transcended to a world where your troubles do simply melt away! He has a television that constantly shows beautiful nature scenes along with super relaxing music played at just the right volume. You can choose to chat with him about anything you can think of or merely close your eyes and truly escape the hustle and bustle just outside. \n\nI can't say enough how absolutely thrilled I am to have Vee as my Hairtstylist! Today, I can't stop being thankful enough for the beautiful, long, silky, healthy, shiny blond hair I have and I have only Vee to thank for that!  And the compliments, wow, everyone is in awe of my gorgeous locks!\n\nThanks a million Vee for making my life that much better now that I absolutely love my hair!!! I seriously have no bad hair days! Just great ones!

<review>Per other reviewers,,this place is difficult to find if just visiting,,not difficult in that it's in an off the wall location or intricate to get to but signage is minimal and its not surrounded by much. If you park in the back and come in through the door that says customers entrance be prepaired to think you walked in through the kitchen becasue you kind of, did.  The host kind of pointed us to our table as others mentioned,,we walked past once and had to ask where he wanted us again,,not a great start,,,BUT,,and its a good but,,the food was amazing. The amount of tastes in this place was like a culinary Crayola box. We stumbled in on 1/2 price wine night which is Sunday-Monday-Tuesday,,,yeeehah!   Nice moderate list to begin with gets downright cheap at 1/2 price, Altos Malbec and Shegesio zin nice. Wait staff took a bit to get to us but was great throughout. Starters were asavado tacos, brie, turkey relleno,,all were very good. I had the blackened pork tenerloins with apple chile sauce,,amazing,,sweet with a hint of heat but overall amazing.  Others had cheese steak, mixed fish grill, Rokerij steak and enchiladas,,all very good. The inside really is a mostly bar with great food so be prepared for some rowdy locals but this place is killer on teh food side and you can go for a 4 star meal in jeans which is what I'm always looking for,,,just a great spot that I will return to in Phoenix any day!

<review>I'm a shameless carnivore.  I like it even better when my meat filled sandwich is dripping with melty, gooey cheese.  A little explicit, yeah, but it's the truth.\n\nI've never been to a Charley's other than the one in Christown/Spectrum (call it what you want) but it is so much fun eating my yummy food and watching all the ghetto people and their spawn mill in and out of the sad mall.\n\nThe food here is great.  I always get the Bacon 3Cheesesteak, and it is the best.  You can't ask for more salty goodness than this.  The steak stuff is always thin and juicy with plenty of salt.  The bread this stuff comes on is kind of weird and crusty, but the insides make it worth it.  Do yourself a favor and make it a combo so you can get a drink and a big cup full of fresh and hot fries.\n\nI know there quite a few of these around the valley, so if Spectrum scares you, check out one of the other places and get what I order.  Good stuff.

<review>"""Note to self: fancy place, not the greatest restaurant to take your 14 mo old on a whim and  you and your hubby are wearing casual wear.  With that said, even though we looked out of place, we still had a great time and the service was excellent!\n\nWe never get our money's worth in these type of churrasco restaurants because neither my husband nor I can pack it in.  However, the meats were delicious and their appetizer/salad spread was yummy, too!!  I love hearts of palm and mushrooms so this was right up my alley but they also had \normal\"""" stuff too like potato salads and regular salads and the like.\n\nGreat place for a date, especially if you want to impress.  You can go in there in casual wear, too, as we did, but it is more of an upscale type establishment.\n\nEnjoy!"""""""

<review>"""This pizza is definitely better than your regular takeout or delivery (domino's, pizza-hut, the works). I ordered the: \n\n- artichoke, tomato  and  basil pizza: really fresh, huge artichoke pieces and nice overall flavor. Does not taste that well when its reheated because you need to eat the veggies fresh, but definitely awesome right off the oven. \n\n- sausage, peperoni and cheese pizza: super meaty, super flavorful and just as awesome when you reheated 2 days later. the pieces of mozzarella are whole (large thick slices) and fresh, not the shredded crap that you get elsewhere. full of pieces of sausage and peperoni, FRIGGING GOOD. \n\n- the antipasto (fresh mozzarella, salami, olives, peppers, fresh basil and bread): the kalamata olives were really nice, the basil leaves were fresh and the peppers were cooked and had a garlicky taste. the huge slabs of mozzarella were fresh and went well when you added some extra virgin olive oil to it. \n\n- canolis: BEST CANOLIS EVER. Super creamy, super crunchy, this dessert made me giggle with happiness. \n\n- tiramisu: it was tasty (not the best, but definitely good). the cake part was moist and the cream was good but it lacked the liquor taste to it at the end. \n\nOverall, good food and a great alternative to regular pizza. The pizzas here are never greasy, your hands (or the cardboard) never end up \oily-shiny\"""" and it actually feels like its good for you. weird."""""""

<review>What is there to say about Saddle Ranch that hasn't been said before? Nothing.\n\nThis is a solid place to grab a few drinks, but the menu doesn't always get a fair shake. \n\nThe food is quite good here. I've never been let down. The chicken tortilla soup, the wings, the onion rings, the rubs, the wraps....everything is fantastic.\n\nAlso, look for the GM and strike up a conversation with the guy. He's a pretty cool dude. I remember a few times he would come over and bring us a gigantic martini glass full of cotton candy on the house. A nice gesture for bring regulars.\n\nService has always been good here, the food has always been good. The drink menu is creative and I LOVE the beer selection.\n\nOn a side note, I refuse to ride the mechanical bull. You can though.

<review>Oh the caprese salad.  It's what dreams are made of. \nAnd the pizza. Oh and the desserts.  Well, pretty much everything is fantastico here at Cibo.  I wish I could kidnap the chef and turn him into my personal man-chef/slave so he could whip me up delicious Cibo-esque dishes whenever the mood struck.\n\nI really am kidding about that. \n\nKind of.\n\nBut really, the food here is great, the service is fine and the prices aren't bad considering how great the food is. \n\nThe restaurant is a really cute, intimate place and my only problem with it is it's far away from my house!

The process of ordering your sandwich is unique and interesting. The sandwiches though...oh my. They are so yum. The bread is fresh, chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. The deli meats are cut when you order the sandwiches and the condiments are just perfect! Whether you get it cold or toasted, you can't go wrong at Which Wich. And try the \house\"""" chips. They are seasoned perfectly! :)"""""""

<review>Sometimes you've got to satisfy your spam musubi cravings, luckily for me there's an Ono's close to my work and I'm able to get me a spam musubi fix. MMMMmmmm for spam musubi, spam and sticky rice with teriyaki sauce wrapped in a seaweed roll... yum yum! And with my spam musubi i usually get the curry chicken katsu... with a scoop of rice and two scoops of macaroni salad... it makes for a good plate lunch altho it's a tad pricey, wish it was slightly cheaper. But we're aways from the islands and plus this Californian chain is not really from Hawaii but it's still good stuff! Totally recommend if you're craving spam musubi and some katsu, it satisfies and spam is just yum!

<review>"""Someone told me about this place and their all you can eat spaghetti. They also mentioned that they have great meatballs...so I had to check it out myself. \nThe first thing that bothered me was the noise level...it's like all the conversations going on in this place remained within the walls. However, the staff was very friendly and the service was good. \nI had the Artichoke, Shrimp  and  Crab Dip which was good, but I wish it had more chucks of crab. I obviously tried their spaghetti with meatballs which I thought was good, but not  the best I've had. The sauce was a bit to watery for me and the meatballs just didn't have that \wow\"""" factor, but it was good (just not the best). I had also ordered a customize Calzone and that was without a doubt fabulous! The size and flavor were definitely in the \""""wow\"""" factor. This helped to push the rating to a 4 star plus the service."""""""

<review>Heather Wilson was an absolute blast to work with on my wedding day! She did an AMAZING job on me and my bridesmaids...we all looked like more beautiful versions of ourselves, very natural but with that little something extra every girl wants on her wedding day! I hired Heather for the whole day, and she went above and beyond the duties of a makeup artisit....providing us with safety pins for dresses, hairspray for flyways, and just making sure we all looked picture perfect. She was worth every penny! I will be recommending her to all of my friends!

<review>"""Went here with a girlfriend of mine and it was great! Compared to other sushi place I go to often this place was kind of expensive. Apparently there is happy hour ALL DAY which is SCHWEET! \n\nI ordered the calamari and it was 'ok'. I'm a huge fan of squid and I was dissapointed that this calamari was cooked a little too long which made it kind of chewy. Edamame is delicious!\n\nI had my first sashimi here (tuna) and it was like an ORGASM in my mouth. It was absolutely delicious and totally worth the outrageous price. We also split a couple of different rolls that were HUGE, each one of them were delicious although a little too 'American\-ized for my tastes :) \n\nI would definatley come back here for drinks or as a date night if you go early. It's a very good place, I only give it 4 stars because it's in DouchebagLand aka Scottsdale."""""""
</review>
<review>Yes, I am the duke of BS west (at the time of writing).\nNo, I do not currently live in Scottsdale (or Arizona for that matter).\nYes, I think this place is a solid 4-stars!\n\nLet me explain what's amazing about this place in reference to the bars in San Francisco: \n\n1. 2 for 1 drinks Wednesday and Saturdays ALL NIGHT. Yea, shut the loose hole! This is an amazing deal! Our happy hour specials are 2-4-1 until 8 or 9, if we're lucky! \n\n2. You know all the boys will either be here or only 2 other places on any given night. I actually think it sucks wet pussy to have to navigate 10-20 bars just to find fresh meat. (not that I ever do... but it's the principle of the thing).\n\n3. Service is actually amazing! Drinks come to you! The bar tenders make 'em strong (especially the gal towards the smoking patio). \n\n4. 2 smoking patios?! NOICE. Many bars in SF require you to go outside!.. it just becomes a pain.\n\n5. They accept card. In the event you didn't know this, many places in SF don't.... \n\nYou may be a local and hate this place for what it is, but for someone who spends extended amount of time in the area every so often, I find it a great place to be near fagily (fag family).

<review>I saw Christine's review and had to throw in my 2 cents.\n\nI love the Humane Society.  I found my first dog at the 13th and Hatcher campus and couldn't have been happier with the service and the dog.\n\nWhen we adopted our second dog from a sick friend, we knew that we had to get this little girl fixed.  When she was old enough, we took her to the Dobbins campus and had her spayed.  The employees were incredibly nice and comforting and our little Layla recovered pretty quickly from the surgery.  And it only cost $60 which is phenomenal if you check with private vets.  They do it all the time, so they are pros at it.

<review>Spent 5 days in the Phoenix area and somehow we ended up eating at Oregano's twice. I was impressed both times. Service was quick and pleasant. \n\nFirst trip I had the Zany Ziti with meatballs. I was not sure what I was getting into then it come to the table. It could have fed a small army. Served in a Bread Bowl jam packed with broken up Meat Balls mixed in with the Ziti and covered with Cheese. What more can I say the HEAVEN! I was only able to eat about a third of it. Made for a great lunch option the following day.\n\nThe second trip I was in a group of 11 people. We sat out side on the deck and enjoyed a combination of appetizers, pizza's, and finished it off with a Pizza Chocolate Chip Cookie - WOW!!!!
</review>
<review>Another excellent Fogo de Chao experience, every bit as good as meals enjoyed in the the Austin and Chicago outposts.  I will say, though, that the Scottsdale edition might be the nicest looking restaurant of the Fogos I've seen.\n\nAs usual, the Picanha (the signature cut) was outstanding.  However, what really caught my attention this time was the Fraldinha, or lower sirloin.  I do not recall this being so good in previous visits, but it was juicy, tender and intensely flavorful.  Of the two fillet mignon offered, the standard (non bacon wrapped) was the best.  Perfectly medium rare, with a beautifully buttery texture.  Sadly, the bacon wrapped version was too overdone.  Although sometimes it's nice to break up the beef parade with some chicken, I am always disappointed.  The lamb and pork ribs, however, are good alternatives.\n\nThe salad bar is fresh and abundant, but don't fill up on too many items here.  What's always impressive to me is the huge wheel of authentic Parmesan Reggiano and it's hard not to carve off a few chunks of rich, salty cheese.  \n\nSide dishes are typical: mashed potatoes (which are light and airy), fried polenta squares and caramelized bananas.  The latter are particularly nice to give your taste buds a break from the meat onslaught, with the sweetness playing a nice counterpoint to rich and salty beef.\n\nAs usual, I will need at least 6 months to recover from this experience.  But, I'll be back.  Just not sure what city it'll be in.

<review>I went to Jason when he used to own the shop across the street. My very colorful tattoo is now 8 years old but still looks new and very vibrant. He's not the best artist in the world but he's good and even better tattoo artist. \n\nMy husband actually got a few tattoos from Jason as well, all colorful, and it's still vibrant. Some tattoo artists have no idea what they're doing and your tattoo can fade after a year or even less. Jason touched up the husband's tattoo that was done not quite right by a shop in Scottsdale for free.\n\nMy friend was visiting from AL earlier this year so of course I took her to Jason. The only day she was available was one of his days off so we had Brandon tattoo her. She changed her mind couple of times of what to get but he didn't mind at all. She's very happy with her tattoo and it still looks fantastic as of couple of weeks ago.\n\nI'm not sure if there's a room in the back or not if you have to undress for a tattoo but in the front is a little waiting room where you can browse through their portfolios and through the door is a big room with 3 chairs for your tattooing pleasure. It was very clean and kept up to date. They let me stick around in an empty chair while my friend was getting hers done and Brian actually kept me company. He even offered to hold my very pink purse while I got a tattoo haha. \n\nThey only take cash so be sure to have yours ready (don't forget to tip!). All 3 has great portfolios so be sure to stop in and take a look.

<review>"""I'm a Yooper-- I was raised in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and left for college.  Ever since (and that's a few years now!!), I have felt the absence of a good pasty nearby.  \n\nTotally by chance had this place recommended to me at a business meeting and was BLOWN away.   I'm used to the traditional \Oggie\"""" and  it brought me right back to my childhood   but as I went with family, got to try a few bites of some of the others--all were amazing including the Royale.  \n\nLove the eclectic crowd too.  Definitely a place to go back to when we're in Phoenix again."""""""

<review>Wow, this was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time. I definitely have my favorite spots but it is rare that I have an entree that knocks my socks off. For me, this was the gnocchi dish with the shitake dijon cream sauce. My husband was surprised that I ordered this, since I don't like mushrooms, and luckily for me, the extent of the mushrooms were some medium ones in the sauce. The gnocchi were very tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I felt like I was eating a delicious mac  and  cheese with some soft foccaccia bread. OMG. We also ordered the porteguese style mussels that were a fave of my husband's. They were just okay to me but overall, were decent. We also ordered the chorizo and manchego risotto that I really liked. We each had a glass of wine. Our server was kind enough to let me sample the prosecco before I ordered it. Good thing I did because I didn't like it. The server asked what kind of wine I liked and then brought me a taste of their white blend which I enjoyed. Overall, before tip, our bill was $50. Very reasonable for three plates and two glasses of wine. \n\nThis place is extremely small inside with 4-6 small table inside and 3-4 tables on their patio. There were two servers and on a busy Fri night, service was slow. But they were very nice and apologetic, so I gave them a break. I noticed the kitchen staff worked extremely efficiently which is a plus for such a small space. I was very impressed. I cannot WAIT to come back here as there were several plates that looked amazing.

<review>Hard to beat the price and selection in performance bicycle. Although the store is not that large, it has pretty much anything you *need*.  If you are looking for blue and white camo pattern bar tape, you will have to buy online, otherwise, just head to performance bike.  Great place to go for any questions, to take a bike on a test ride or just check out the shiny new bikes.  The employees all seem very knowledgable and super friendly.
</review>
<review>L O V E  Phx City.\n\nThis place is amazing!  Of the five million times I have been here, I have yet to actually go for Happy Hour, which I hear is equally amazing.\n\nI love that this place is nice enough to warrant going to for a special occasion, but neighborhood enough that you will usually run into at least one person you know every time you come.\n\nThe Rose Lane Chicken makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Bread Pudding is divine, and they get mucho brownie points for not putting raisins in it!!  (I am super not into raisins)  They have a well rounded wine list, which was my go to, until the day I tried the Pomegranate Mango Collins.  Hellllooooo drink love!  Sweet and tart, but not too much of either, this drink is awesome!\n\nMany awesome things on the menu, great daily specials,  and  you can really taste the love and local difference in all of their menu items.  The service is 97% awesome, very seldom do I get slow service there  and  it has never been slow enough to irritate me.\n\nDefinitely a go to place!

<review>"""i eat a lot of sushi and teppan. this is one of, if not the best sushi/teppanyaki joint in phx.\n\nthe sushi is meaty and delicious and well-priced. not fishy tasting at all (\fishy\"""" means \""""not fresh\""""). the only negative is their selection is lacking a bit.\n\nthe teppanyaki may be the best of any places i have been to. soup and salad come with the meal. the soup is not miso soup and i dont really care for it. the salad on the other hand . . . best citrus-ginger dressing of any japanese restaurant. the filet is seriously like butter. only thing is, there is no filet + scallops combo -- you have to get the ny strip to get the combo. i suppose you can ask but i didnt. the only other negative is that they do not make the fried rice at your table, they just bring you a bowl of it from the kitchen. come on, thats part of the draw of teppan!\n\nalso, their lunch is amazing! for less than $4, you get a box lunch with entree/meat, salad, rice and orange slices. best deal in scottsdale. wish i still worked across the street."""""""
</review>
<review>"""Let me begin by saying that I don't want to sound pretentious but like everyone else's reviews I'm reading I find it REAL hard to give such a standout score to a chain.   Yet everytime I walk into this place (which is conveniently located a couple of blocks from my house) I feel like quoting Randall from Clerks.  You know the scene where he asks Dante if he can borrow his car keys so he can go to the video store and Dante says \you work in a video store\""""and he replies \""""yeah but I work in a shitty video store\"""" and then they show him walking into the other video store with angelic music as if he is ascending into heaven ... that's the feeling I get when I walk into this place.  A major plus is it doesn't FEEL like a chain ... the aforementioned staff recommendations scattered throughout the store give it a cozy feel and make you forget its a chain.  Unlike other reviewers I disagree in that the staff is helpful and attentive ...To me however this is a plus as I'm allowed to peruse at my own pace and search on my own...yet the only time I asked for assistance (the 8 pack of guiness rack was empty) they promptly filled my request.  I'm more of a beer and irish whiskey guy as a rule and their choices here are varied and appropriately priced.  One of the only places I've found where you can grab a bottle of powers and I also find the locally brewed cave creek chile beer to be a surprising treat (think a non-shitty corona with a chile floating in the bottom instead of a lime floating on top).  This place has soooo much wine to choose from I've been experimenting again lately ... current faves are zen of zin zinfandel and renwood syrah  If you like booze, cigars and cheap prices this place can't be beat even if it is a chain."""""""
</review>
<review>Nice upscale restaurant. It is on the small side so you should probably make reservations on typical busy night..fri, sat etc. They are very attentive here though and service is very good. \n\nIts not your normal restaurant or portion size when it comes to the food. The plates are small and they recommend 5 dishes to share between two people. (yes it is also expensive). The menu is also not that large either and they do not have the typical ingredients you might not be used too so it is def an experience you should try just once.\n\nEverything was very good, ambiance was nice and romantic and the wine selection is phenomenal.\n\np.s try the dessert  wine sampler!
</review>
<review>"""There's nothing really to say that hasn't already been said about Merc, but i wanted to add my 5-star opinion to the lot.  \n\nThe music is good, the cocktails better, and the ambiance the best thing about the place.  \n\nI don't know how they manage to avoid the d-factor, but they really do.  Maybe the music, low lighting, and classy vibe settles the buckle-shoe wearers down, so, to that I say, \well done, merc\""""\n\nThe drinks here can really add up, tho ... and its not a complaint, just be prepared for it is all."""""""
</review>
<review>This is probably the best sushi you can find in the Valley.  The owner is from Japan and I believe they import their fish from Japan.  My husband and I went in, not expecting much from the food, but we were pleasantly surprised.  The pork spare ribs were delectable with a slightly crunchy sweet crust.  We didn't try much else except the fish because it was so darn fresh!\n\nYou need to get here early on weekends because there are not too many tables.  Parking can be tough in the strip mall with the dim sum place next door.  I would give this place four stars but it is pricey for the portions.
</review>
<review>This place RAWKS!   Been to many sorbet, shaved ice, frozen yogurts, gelato and ice-cream joints from LA to Chicago (not NYC yet)...this is the PLACE!  I tried the Brownie Swirl and Salted Butter Caramel ice cream and I'm in love.  The molasses cookies are delicious.  \n\nUpon arrival I was greeted by an eyeful of beautiful frozen and baked goods.  Already a happy camper the clean and modern decor iced it as a five star vacation fer me in the AZ heat.  \n\nThe two owners were great and very friendly (five stars fer being cool).  I can't wait to finish my take home pint and head back to try another flavor.

<review>Great staff! FAB food! LOVE that you can ala carte the tacos and add or take away from what you need. Beans..yep. Beans .. Nope. Margaritas .. Icy.. top shelf .. Premium.. strong! Who's driving again??? Love the way that the flat shell is brought instead of greasy, carb laden chips all taken from some plastic bag and greased down and tossed before you with some jarred salsa. I love this place. It brings class to the cocina. I always get the Mezcal chicken tacos. Eat one. Bring the rest home for the next day. Splurge on the beans and flat shell and salsa. Tres bien!

<review>I found Valentina through Yelp and decided to take my wedding dress there because of all the excellent reviews. I have been to many tailors throughout the years and I have to say she is the best tailor ever! I am never going anywhere else! My wedding dress looked amazingly perfect after she was done with it. She added a double bustle, took in the straps and raised the plunging V-neck line in 2 weeks and my dress was lace with tons of beading! She is extremely talented and her prices are very affordable. In addition to wedding dresses, she also does excellent work on suit jackets, blazers and dresses. I am very thin so I always have to get my clothes taken in. She does such a great job and the clothes look as if they were never altered. I always think of her when I shop because I know if it doesn't fit well, I can always take it to her to fit perfectly. I am so glad I found her..... I am now able to take all my designer clothes to her without worrying about them getting ruined. Try her for yourself....you'll be so glad that you did!!
</review>
<review>I've been to a lot of libraries - LA libraries, NYC libraries.  I love libraries.  Burton Barr rocks!  \n\nYes, it's cool-looking or interesting or whatever but the best thing is the huge array of books.  One thing the Phoenix public library system gets right is the book collection.  They always have the latest titles and they aren't afraid to collect both recent Christian lit and Gay/Lesbian lit.  Any place that provides both for its patrons is a damn good library indeed!
</review>
<review>Roasted chicken salad with gorgonzola, grapes, candied walnuts, and celery served over mixed greens and drizzled with a lovely balsamic vinaigrette.    I ate it all, along with a healthy serving of bread and warm olives.  And by the way, those warm olives are not a serving of just a few.  It's a pot of them bathed in olive oil.  Probably the best deal on the menu at a mere 450 pennies, if you like olives.\n\nYes, I'm a fan of Marcella's and hope to make it back to her kitchen soon.

<review>"""Sarah Jessica Parker.  Stephon Marbury.  Venus Williams.  What do these things have in common?  \n\nThey are all selling their fashion lines exclusively through Steve  and  Barry's.  Oh yea - and they are GOOD! \n\nThe Starbury line has shoes that look like sweet Nikes but cost $15.  My girlfriend is an athletic shoe snob that has fallen in love with these shoes.  Not only does it cheaply feed her \I must have a different pair of shoes to match every outfit\"""" fetish, but she has also found them to be just as if not more comfortable that brands where she's paid 4-10 times as much. And it doesn't stop there.  There are Starbury polo shirts that specifically match particular shoes.  And ya know how much?  $5.  On our last trip there were 2 shoes and 4 shirts purchased for the price she would have normally bought 1 pair of shoes.  She was in heaven.\n\nThe Venus line isn't out yet - but she recently signed to sell exclusively with them.  That alone was enough to get a friend of mine interested to check the store out.\n\nI'm totally Bitten by the Bitten bug.  SJP's clothing line is totally unexpected in that it's cute, it's fun, it's fashionable and it's cheap.  I mean it.  With no sale going at all you're looking at  prices at or less than Target.  Denim skirts- $12.  Cute white button down shirts $9.  It was kinda insane. I kept looking for the candid camera to catch our shock.  Even the accessories were cute. \n\nBut I have to say, as awesome as these individual things are, the whole center of the store is a giant divider filled with cubbies of t-shirts.  From your favorite college sports teams to oh-my-god-they-did-not-just-say-that funny t-shirts.  On our first trip there we OD'd a bit here and got about 8-10 shirts.  But at 2 for $15, it's so hard to say no.\n\nThis is not a mall where you would expect for this to be located.   They are doing some kind of massive re-development over there which should help - but let's just say that this is no Scottsdale mall.  But I've gotta say, it's the only one in Arizona - and it's worth the drive.\n\nUPDATE: Channel 3's Good Morning AZ did a remote show from this mall today.  They did a quickie on Steve  and  Barry.  The female newscaster was in a serious state of shock and awe with the clothing.  And I learned that nothing in the store is ever over $20.  Good to know..."""""""

<review>I love this restaurant!  The hummus with pine nuts and with chicken (or without) is to die for!  I love hummus, and this is so good!  I have also eaten their schwarma pits (fried garbonzo beans in a pita) which is equally delicious.  Yum!  I have also had a small lunch pizza with spinach, pesto, goat cheese, and tomatos. Yum! All in all this place has great food, and In have always had great service, and delicious food. It is very fun and consistent.  I will always go back!

<review>I went here recently with a medium sized group for a bachelor party dinner.  We arrived right at 6 pm for our reservations and were seated immediately.  We were given the rundown on how everything works, and then were unleashed.  \n\nMy first stop was the salad.  I came in with a plan, go easy on the salad part to leave room for the good stuff (meat) and get some salad fixin's to at least make it seem like it is a somewhat balanced meal.  Overall, I have to say I was pretty disappointed with the salad bar.  The only things that I were really impressed with was the fresh cheeses (fresh mozzarella balls especially).  I guess the pesto salad dressing was nice but most of it was just average for me.  \n\nFinished the salad plate, and flipped the red/green card to go.  (Note:  I'm not sure how efficient this system was, there were times when I was green and the gaucho's passed me by, and times where I was red when they asked how I liked my cut).   All of the sudden it was a whirlwind of skewer toting gaucho's, asking if you'd like some of their meat (hmm...that sounds more like a description for a bachelorette party?).  I tried countless different cuts of meats, top sirloin, filet, chicken leg, lamb, etc.  My least favorites were the lamb (did not like the flavor, I usually really like lamb) and garlic meat (can't remember the cut offhand) which was a little overpowering with the garlic (and I like garlic).  The best were the filet mignon and the rib eye.  The other meats I had were also very good.  We were also served some cheesy bread rolls and a trio of sides, garlic mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried plaintains.  I did not try the plantains, but the garlic mashed were uninspired at best (and opposite of the meat had little to no garlic flavor) but the polenta was fantastic.  I had at least three of those suckers.  \n\nService was mostly good.  One problem with the meat service is that you get hit with 5-7 different meats in rapid succession, then you don't see another server for a bit.  Kind of feast of famine...  Also, we had one person order an after dinner coffee that wasn't deliver and an error on the check.  I additionally thought that the layout of the restaurant wasn't great, when it was crowded when we left it was pretty hard making it through all the tables when they were full and you had tons of employees running around.\n\nI liked it.  I would definitely go back to a brazilian style steakhouse again, though if I went to Fogo, I might go for lunch (starting Oct 1) and save about $20 bucks.

<review>If you're looking to eat a fancy schmancy finger licking good burger, then you should hit Zinburger.\n\nI had a veggie burger, with one of the yummiest bloody marys in town...baconized goodness in a tall glass of awesomeness, no lies.\n\n My friend had the Tukey burger and LOVED it. Now, that is saying a lot since she doesn't enjoy eating any kind of meat. We both shared some sweet potato fries, that just hit the spot. \n\nOn another occasion I had the Zucchini Fries and THE Zinburger and a Bananas Foster shake...it shook my world, oh yeah. \n\nEnough said...\n\nCheck it out.

<review>I was visiting Phoenix, Az and a friend of mine suggested this place to go for dinner. This place isn't exactly cheap, but the food is pretty good. As all the other previous yelpers have yelped about, there is a special $20 deal for a bottle of wine and 4 bruschetta choice topping. The 4 toppings we had was the brie  and  apple w/ fig spread (our most favorite! Easy to make at home too in case you are low on money but feel like being fancy, lol), smoked salmon w/ pesto (pretty tasty), salami w/ pesto (nothing really worth writing about)  and  the warm artichoke spread (was actually good, but would probably want to try another option if I ever come back here again). \nWell this place also serves soups and sandwiches. The sandwiches are a pretty good big size and are very tasty. The bread they make your sandwiches with are just amazing. I had the turkey sandwich and it was great! My fiance and I also tried some dessert wine (I really love dessert wines only) and we loved the Moscato the best. But $7 for one small glass is not really a good deal. I could easily buy a Moscato bottle of wine for $16 at Bev  and  Mo that has at least 4 servings of wine. But obviously when you're at the restaurant you pay for the convenience and service.\nWell as other yelpers have said previously, the service is quiet attentive. My water glass was refilled several times throughout our meal. \nAlso the bathrooms are pretty large and interesting. The decor inside the restaurant has that posh, homey and relaxed w/ low lighting, type of vibe. Also the parking lot is pretty small and so you will have to drive up to do the valet. We tipped the guy who brought us back our car, as I guess that is probably the norm. \nBut overall, I thought this place had good food, but the price was a little pricey for me (come on' sandwiches and appetizers with 2 glasses of wine for 2 people costing nearly $50? I am pretty sure I could go somewhere else for the same food but cheaper... yes I know some of you may argue that the food won't be as tasty, but I still think it's a little nuts to be paying so much for 2 people for this low fuss food).

<review>What a fabulous dinner at Vincent's on Camelback. Thankfully Chef Vincent G. was in the kitchen  when we recently dined and the meal was absolutely superb. We began with an appetizer of foie gras with Schnepf Farm peaches and a balsamic glaze. A small portion, but if you love foie gras as we do then you will not be disappointed. Meltingly lucious. For a salad I chose the Raddichio with Belgian Endive and it was so wonderful. It consisted of a mixture of chopped raddichio, belgian endive, pears, pecans, and a mild blue cheese in a lovely, mild vinaigrette. I plan to try to duplicate this at home as it was so delicious. My husband had his heart set on a lobster salad but it was not on the menu that night. Not to worry though as our waiter, Dino, said he was sure the kitchen could do one. They did not disappoint. It was a lovely salad they created with big chunks of lobster and heirloom tomatoes. My husband said it was perfect. For our entrees I chose the lobster in beurre blanc with basil pasta. That lobster was  a small one (the waiter said it would be a whole lobster split, but a small one)  but I have to say it was as sweet and fresh tasting as ones I've eaten in Cape Cod or Maine. Just incredibly delicious and the basil pasta was a perfect accompaniment. My husband ordered the duck confit and I have to say after tasting his I'd be very hard pressed to decide which entree I liked best. The confit was served with lyonnaise potatoes. Chef Vincent really did some magical things in his kitchen to give a crispness to the layer of duck fat sitting on top of the thigh and drumstick. We are confit fans but unless you have a gallon of duck fat at home it's pretty hard to duplicate in your own kitchen, plus it's doubtful it would taste as good as this one did. For dessert we both chose the Grand Marnier souffles served with a creme anglaise. Those beauties were ethereal and heavenly....like eating a cloud with a sauce that begs to be licked off the spoon. The service by Dino and the other waitstaff was top notch. We managed to greet Chef Vincent as we were leaving and told him how much we appreciated his genius. This chef is a Valley treasure and if you have not had the chance to try his restaurant you are missing out. He was the winner in the past of the James Beard SW  Chef awards and it's not hard to see why. He is French born and French trained and in my humble opinion NO ONE COOKS AS WELL AS THE FRENCH. We will return as soon as we can. This is still my favorite restaurant in the Valley bar none.

<review>First Watch on Black Canyon Hwy in Phoenix has amazing service and very good food! They're worth the drive. You won't be disappointed. Coincidentally, I went there b/c it was right next door to the Courtyard Marriott. I have been back several times and continue to receive excellent customer service and delicious food. \n\nMy favorite breakfast is their Tri-Athlete omelette; which I hesitatingly tried b/c it was a healthy choice but fell in love with it! Wonderfully roasted vegetables in an egg-white only omelette topped with salsa...muahhh, magnifico!!\n\nFor lunch I had their Pecan Dijon chicken salad...wow, another amazing dish full of flavors...good to the last drop!\n\nAnd lastly, their customer service...always SPOT ON! Once we had only 15 minutes. Informed the always-welcoming staff and VOILA, an excellent breakfast in exactly 15 minutes. I'll be back soon! \n\nThank you First Watch on Black Canyon Hwy!! You're awesome :)

<review>Forgive me Dr. Fitzgerald, my cardiologist, as I have sinned. This was a capitol offense as it was a premeditated artery clogging session after our visit today. A crime of passion. \n\nWhile working my way through college as an FTT conductor (long since eliminated) on the El trains around Chicago, I ate a lot of ethnic and soul food. I was 18 years old working summers on the worst shifts possible at all hours of the night, which carried me to some interesting neighborhoods to say the least. In other words, chicken and waffles was not new to me.\n\nWhich brings me to my crime today. After receiving an A+ checkup from the good doctor, I made a beeline over to Lo-Lo's. Like I mentioned I have eaten chicken and waffles before, but for the most part eliminated this from the diet. I had also dined here before but it had been a while. In order to facilitate a fresh review, I made my doctors appointment to coincide with a Lo-Lo's lunch.\n\nI am happy to report that nothing has changed. Great fried chicken, I had a number six, leg, thigh and waffle with a side of greens to ease the guilt. Unlike many places around the country, specifically in the south that serve sweet tea, Lo-Lo's also has unsweetened which is to my liking. The chicken was served hot, the waffle cooked to perfection. Greens were cooked perfectly, a mix of mustard and collard I do believe. Add some red rooster Louisiana hot sauce, some Trappey's, a little syrup, butter and lord a mighty, my soul was healed.\n\nService was with a smile, refills offered before asking, and a team effort. Top notch. \n\nSoul food, indeed. The Yelp-fession helps as well.

<review>We had a nice lunch at Herb Box today, and would definitely like to go back and check out dessert - the pies looked really good.  We had a BLT w/pancetta and a fried egg on brioche - very good!  There was what I think was a chipotle mayo on it to make it a little spicy.  Another dish we had was pulled pork served over soft, creamy scrambled eggs w/a green salsa, crispy tortilla strips and served w/flour tortillas.  I can't remember the name, but this is one of the best breakfast dishes I've had in a while.  It was spiced very nicely, I am going to try to replicate that one at home.  To boost the cholesterol, I added had a side of bacon which looked kinda small, but the bacon was quite good.  \n\nI should mention the drinks.  I order Arnold Palmers all the time, and theirs is up near the top - more tea than lemonade, and whatever tea they used was brewed very well.  The strawberry lassi, which is basically is a smoothie w/yogurt, strawberries and cardamom, wasn't really that great for me, it seemed too icy (ever after they remade it) with not enough strawberry flavor.  Maybe just not my thing, I don't know.  \n\nOur server had a really laid back attitude, but she was fairly on top of it.  Overall, I enjoyed Herb Box very much and would recommend it.

<review>The Cornish Pasty is so full of awesome that it is really hard to describe it's awesome awesomeness. It's kind of hipstery so i can't say that i'm their target audience but whatever. I goes and eats where i please. I just throw a few butterfly sticker-tattoos on various parts of my body and blend right in.\n\nI like places with a character and this place has it in spades.  The cooks/waiters/waitresses are friendly and the pastys are good eats! \nI must warn that they are more filling that you would think. \n\nGood beer good food! Ridiculously cheap (knock back a few Rogues for me) The dark lighting also makes your friends look sooo much better.\n\nwin win.  and win.

<review>this place is tucked away in the middle of a neighborhood and really surprises you. it doesn't look like much from the outside, but step inside and you're transported into a cozy little space with charming comfort food.\n\ni didn't actually sit down, i ordered take out because i didn't feel like getting all dressed up and would rather enjoy my fried chicken and mac and cheese in the comfort of my own home. the servers were friendly and brought my order up right away, 3 boxes tied together with a string. sure, it looks awesome, but the second i hit a speed bump a box fell over and fried chicken fell all over my car seat. yes, i still ate them.\n\ngot home, dug in, and damn, that was the best, crispiest, and juciest fried chicken i've ever had. same goes for the mac and cheese, with bread crumbs, crispy prosciutto, and lobster. lobster in mac and cheese?!?! i know it sounds insane but it was actually quite unexpectedly good. the white cheddar waffles that came with the fried chicken were soggy by the time i got home, which soooooo sucked because really that's what i was looking forward to most, and i couldn't even eat them they were that soggy and gross. but that's my own damn fault for ordering waffles to go.\n\ni'll be back to actually sit down and enjoy a meal here. very cozy. love it.
</review>
<review>I brought in curtains that I needed some alterations. I needed them in a hurry and asked for same day service but the staff said next day would be the best they could do. I actually thought that was very reasonable so no problem. Then, at 5pm same day, I got a surprise phone call that they were ready. They did same day service and really helped me out. They did a good job on the work and they look great.

<review>"""My boyfriend has been talking about this place since I've known him and today when we were weeding in the yard something smelled like green curry (I know this sounds weird, but this is how my brain works, don't ask) and that was it, I had the bug, I needed Thai food. The lady who greeted us was very nice, and was the same person who served us and cashed us out for that matter. Decor was fairly standard for a Thai food place, including the compulsory fish tank right in the middle of the room. My boyfriend had his absolute favorite Pad See Ew. Which he enjoyed as always. I had the Green Curry with chicken. We both opted for the 1 star spiciness, I think the server laughed at that, but c'mon, I'm Finnish and French-Canadian here lady, my palate is not made for Thai spice! It was the perfect amount of spicy for me, and that good, creamy, warm green curry flavor. The vegetables were perfectly cooked so they still had that crunch. Maybe it was because I wasn't paying, or maybe it's because I've been desensitized by East Coast prices but I thought that $24+tip for the amount of food that we got was perfectly reasonable. I think it's a solid place. \n\nSidenote: I see that most people have responded \No\"""" for delivery, however on their website, for this location it says \""""Call and ask about free delivery\"""" so I don't know if it's new, or just lesser known."""""""

<review>I went to one of the soft-opening events for Arrogant Butcher and thoroughly enjoyed the food. The service was a bit hit-and-miss, but that can be forgiven, considering the restaurant hadn't opened to the public and was still ironing out the bugs.\n\nOur party of four shared the mussels and rock shrimp for appetizers. While the shrimp were good (a bit over-fried for my taste, but the r\u00e9moulade was quite tasty), the mussels were outstanding. The broth was exceptionally flavorful, and the shellfish was cooked perfectly. My only gripe is with the pomme frites included in the bowl -- were they left out, I wouldn't miss them one iota. \n\nFor dinner, our table ordered the salmon, the crab-stuffed chicken and the fish  and  chips, while I dined on the bone-in rib eye. The dry-aged steak was cooked to perfection and served with a delightfully flavorful jus, though there was a large portion of fat and gristle in the steak. The fish portion of my wife's dish was wonderful, while the chips were nothing more than the fries included with the mussels. The cod was cooked to perfection, and was battered in a spicy beer batter that perfectly complimented the very dilly from-scratch tartar sauce. My dining companions raved about the other dishes.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the peanut butter cup, which is composed of a warm peanut butter mousse topped with chocolate gelato. It was decadent and quickly devoured by the four of us.\n\nMy biggest gripe comes not about the food, but about the service at the bar, where some in my party waited more than 10 minutes prior to being seated for requests as simple as a martini or a draft beer. I also would have liked to see a larger scotch and whiskey selection, but Fox Concepts does score points for having a quite large selection of Arizona beers, both on tap and in bottles. \n\nI will absolutely return.

<review>"""Egg whites and oatmeal and brizza oh my!\nI've been hearing about Scramble for months now and I finally made it in for a breakfast meeting today.  I loved it...\n\nThe oatmeal was not only the biggest bowl of oatmeal I've ever seen, it was served piping hot with pecans, raisins, and milk / brown sugar on the side.  I also had a side of egg whites done just right.  (I was trying to be healthy since I recently realized I gained some LBS in the last few months).  However, I did have a few bites of my dining companion's brizza - it was also delicious!  The coffee did the job too... I left with a nice caffeine buzz and a full tummy too... the perfect way to start my day!\n\nI love the clean, urban feel to this place... the staff was super friendly and the bathrooms were clean.  I wish I lived closer to Scramble as it would definitely be a regular in my rotation.  Even though it's a bit of a drive for me, I will be back... especially to check out their upcoming \breakfast for dinner\"""" charity events on Wednesday nights.  (Stay tuned for info on the Yelp events calendar).\n\nYou've got a new fan in me, Scramble... see you again soon!"""""""

<review>I've got to give mad props to any business that really checks up on it's Yelp reviews!  While I gave Wildflower a positive four star review, I did point out a few things about the location and restaurant that I did not like.  Wildflower's founder, Louis, contacted me to tell me that he agrees with my assessment of the parking situation outside the restaurant, and to show me where customers could find nutritional information and ways to order their meals to fit their dietary needs.\n\nWhile stopping in for a soup and half sandwich order for lunch, I decided to try a baked good on this visit.  It was just a chocolate chip cookie, nothing crazy, but I've got to say it was a very tasty cookie.  Perhaps a scone or muffin will be in order next time I drive by.

<review>These aren't the snowcones we grew up with. Kids, adults and even the elderly can enjoy  Bahama Buck's shaved ice (teeth not required). They have any flavor you can think of. I was the weird kid that drank pickle juice from the jar, but if I could have gotten that from a snow cone!? Um.. yes please!!\n\nYes the shaved ice is a vehicle for artificial flavors.. isn't that what shaved ice is all about? That's like giving a burger place a bad review because the buns were vehicles for meat.\n\nI also recommend getting the cream on top (traditional Hawaiian-style) and getting the vanilla ice cream-surprise in the bottom. Pick a flavor you like, and ask them what they recommend with it.. I wouldn't pick more than 2 or 3 flavors for one shaved ice, but go crazy if you like!

<review>Found it by strolling through Old Town, liked the look/feel from the outside and peeked in and like it even more.  Mah/pop joint for 22 years the last 19 by same two partner's.  Very friendly bartender and server/owner greeted us immediately, as sat ourselves in this small quaint lil joint, most accompanied by locals, but did have the usual tourist of which we are.  Full bar, menu of usual bar/grill fare, but we dug it.  A club sammy and the special today, the pulled pork sammy.  Both solid, not too anything including grease or sauce so that was nice.  Great steak cut fries and potato salad to match.  Bottomless soda and iced tea.  Great place regularly checking back if we wanted anything, if it was to our liking and offering to top off our drinks.  We understand the desert is bomb, but didn't have any room for it.  \n\nCheck it out!
</review>
<review>When it came down to picking a lunch spot I saw El Yaqui and wanted to give it a shot... It's in this really cool open air shopping complex walk to the back and you will find El Yaqui. Walked in and the staff was really friendly they seemed to have a lot of regulars going in and out... I ordered the # 1 (3 tacos and beans and rice 1st taco Lengua   was really good 2nd taco Carne Asada was super good 3rd taco Pastor was good). Out of the three I would get the Carne Asada again really good salsa as well so this is a must stop for any fan of real deal street tacos.

<review>Once again I will be different from the crowd here, and no, I do not work at this restaurant. I purchased a coupon for about 40% off, without checking the reviews first. After I bought it, ($4 for $25 off) I checked the reviews and almost said forget it. Glad I didnt and went anyway. Four of us went and we voted and all gave 4 stars. We got the sampler appetiser, and Won Ton soup which was enough for the 4 of us. Excellent soup. My wife and son got curry and my other son got the rice noodle soup. I got the chicken basil. #5 in the spice catagory. Loved it. We all loved everything. The restaurant atmosphere was good, and did not notice anything dirty, but then we were there at night. My only complaint would be that the soda's tasted funny. I had a Dr Pepper, and it tasted like something else. But I would diffenately come back here again.

<review>Quaint pizza joint in historic downtown Phoenix. My family tells me this area has really picked up since I left in 2001, and now with the new lightrail, I believe them. Cibo has a lovely patio (perfect for spring/summer, but even w/ the heat lamps it would have been too cold), a cute tiny bar (not much room for waiting), and great thin crust pizza. I like the light feeling of the pizza, but I think it could be more flavorful. Still, for Phx, this place is pretty great. I recommend trying a couple pizzas and sharing. Also the pear salad is fantastic! I think I enjoyed it even more than the pizzas.
</review>
<review>I'm amazed to find a place like this in AZ!! I was ranting and raving about it for days because it really surprised me how good it could be. \n\nWhen I went there, I got so excited I ordered AALLL of my favorites. Got the green onion pancake (delish), egg and chive dumplings (yummy!), potstickers (pretty good), freshly made dumplings (so good). \n\nThe staff there was really friendly and sweet. Real Chinese people making the dumplings right in the front so you know it's fresh! it's not the cleanest place and the menu might be confusing if you haven't had this type of food before but this would be a good place to try something new! :D
</review>
<review>"""I do love this place. And not just because one of the hottest waitresses I've ever seen in my life works there. (I still haven't mustered the courage to say much more than \Please\"""" and \""""thank you\"""" to her, for the record). \n\nI can't think of a Chinese place that serves tastier hot and sour soup. I love the free salad with peanut sauce dressing that comes as soon as you sit down. I love the flat $7 price for almost every single entree no matter how elaborate it may be. Granted, this is yet another cafeteria-style restaurant with seating for 8 million people, which I normally detest and mark points off for. But if the food is good enough to compensate, I'm willing to overlook it."""""""

<review>"""I've only been here once but it was love at first bite (and sip).\n\nA cute wine bar reportedly set in an old Post Office- hence POSTino, but is not apparent with the trendy decor and lively yet intimate atmosphere perfect for a date or group of friends. \n\nThe Happy Hour on Tuesday really is a steal. I came on a double date, each couple ordering a bottle of wine and bruschetta (arguably pronounced brush-ket-ah) totaling a mere $20 a pair!\n\nThe wine selection is fairly eclectic. The BF and I rather arbitrarily picked the Carro Red Blend from Spain, a \Postino Exclusive\"""". When it came to the taste test the waitress did not assume the man would decide and let me taste for satisfaction (yes- I felt empowered). Fantastico! Perfect mix of smooth with a kick that's not too bitey or intense. \n\nThe bruschetta came in generous portions of 4x4, 4 slices of 4 different selections, the perfect amount of food to complement half a bottle of wine. Each was amazing but the gold medal goes to the White Bean and Chopped Tomato. The savory, sweet and tangy flavors will make your tastebuds dance for joy. \n\nTIP: avoid the crowd by arriving before 6:30 or after 8:30. Our 7:00 arrival left us waiting 40 min for a table but my 4 stars says it was well worth it!"""""""
</review>
<review>Normally, I go into detail about a restaurant...but why bother when you know its going to be the same goodness everytime you go!\n\nGreat wine list for sure!\n\nSteaks always come out piping hot with the butter jumping off the plate.  Cut into the steak and soak up every last bit of that butter!  It will be a party in your mouth.\n\nDesert...you can't leave without!  Even just to take it home (if you are too full) is worth it.  \n\nYou won't be disappointed in this place...guaranteed!

<review>Sophie's in one word?  Perfect.\n\nI only go twice a year to celebrate the end of the fall and spring semesters.  Why?  Because I don't want it too become familiar or stale.  Yes, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for and Sophie's doesn't disappoint.\n\nDining is an experience.  You put on shined shoes and a tie and make reservations.  I like to go around 5:30 because it's usually not that busy.  The dining room is inviting, calming, welcoming.  You can have a conversation without having to raise your voice.  \n\nI always make it a point to try something way out of my comfort zone:\nLobster Bisque -- the last thing I eat before I die!\n sweet breads (a.ka. brains) -- ethereal...\ngooey, runny cheese -- salty and tangy\npate (goose liver) -- creamy and so flavorful\n\nThings I wouldnt' have eaten in a million years are some of the best things I have EVER eaten.  Sophie's just invites you to be daring.\n\nDo you wait for your food?  Yes!  But that is the best part.  You can have a conversation with your date, you can relax.  They don't make you feel rushed so why should you take on the responsibility yourself?  Just enjoy yourself.  The food is coming.\n\nSo many places are so desperate to turn over tables that diners adopt the same mentality.  Gotta get my food fast, gotta eat it fast, gotta get out of here!  \n\nI love Sophie's because I can take the time to appreciate everything.  It is just so wonderful to find a place like that to look forward to every year.  It's worth the wait.

<review>Not a single complaint about this place! \n\nWe decided to bar hop a bit before heading to see Mason Jennings last night, and when we arrived at the Crescent Ballroom we were actually kinda pissed we didn't just hang out there before the show.  Here's what I liked about the place:\n\n~friendly staff\n~nice outdoor patio\n~reasonably priced drinks\n~an audio feed into the restaurant/bar area... this was especially nice because we didn't have to miss anything to get drinks or go to the bathroom.\n~plenty of seating and standing room to watch the show\n~a second smaller stage outside the main stage (had a guy playing as the Mason Jennings show let out).\n\nWe didn't try any of the food but we're gonna try to get back here for another show as soon as we can!

<review>I cannot believe I haven't reviewed this place! I love the Lost Leaf. It's rare that my husband and I ever get out without the kiddos, but when we do, Lost Leaf is almost always on the agenda. It's such a laid back vibe, we can't help but really enjoy ourselves.\n\nI love that the music is in a different area so you're not so crowded when you sit down to have a drink. And for how small the place is, it's surprisingly roomy once you get inside. LOVE the art on the walls and the crowd is always great. I feel like the limited beer and wine menu keeps the frat boys out and the 'normals' in. Major perk. We usually have an Ace Pear, grab a table, and chit chat with all of our friends. I really love this place, I'm happy to see it flourish.

<review>I still remember the first time I went to Joe's Farm Grill.  It was a mild May evening and we decided to eat outside. The idea of farm fresh foods really appealed to me.  I am always beyond satisfied with my meal.  I don't think there has been a time that I have been there that I didn't order a barbecue chicken pizza.  I am not a fan of most novelty pizzas, but this one is just amazing.  I'm pretty sure the bbq sauce they use, is the same one they use at Joe's Real BBQ.  The enormous tree behind the Farm Grill is sick and we always crack jokes about the sign about falling and scorpions.  The line can be a little long, but they are quick at the order window and it is definitely worth the wait.  Don't forget to try them for breakfast as well, mmm breakfast tacos...  Do yourself a favor and walk off that delicious meal through the farm and sneak a grape (when they are in season) that grow on the arbors and fences.  Enjoy and remember to eat local
</review>
<review>This is probably the best bar you can go to in the area, it is a nice higher end place for a drink (I cant stand BWW).  The appetizers are good, food is good, service is top notch but I never think of this place for dinner.  First off, you will wait and more than an hour at peak times and I would rather just go to Pei Wei.  Chicks love this place though so if you are single I recommend eating here everyday, ha ha.

<review>Steve's - where whole foods rain? \n\nThe front cover of Steve's menu speaks towards the owners views, policies and procedures regarding the use of chemicals on/in their foods. Simply put, there are no chemical preservatives used on any food items they sell. Now to some this may be of no concern, but to others this mentality is priceless. I had a chicken salad and draft beer....I know I know, salad and beer are not exactly a normal combo...but then again I'm not exactly your normal dude either. Never the less, it was fantastically chemical free. I sat at the bar, my usual m.o., and the service was friggin stellar; hats off the barkeep. \n\nAll and all I had a great experience. I give 4-stars for customer service and lack of chemicals.\n\nGo to Steve's.

<review>My friends and I used our groupons today for Stellar Adventures' ATV tour, and we had a blast!  It was the first time riding for all four of us (plus another family of three), so before we actually went off on the trail, we all met up at the staging area to sign waivers, get instructions etc.\n\nAfter all that smorgasborg, we helmeted up and hopped on our ATVs.  We all started off slow to get a feel of our rides, but before long, we came across our first challenge of taking a dip from the paved road onto the trail.  Everyone passed the test, albeit slowly, and we were off to a stellar adventure (two hours of riding time).\n\nAfter a few stop and gos, a few of us felt more comfortable than others, and so our tour guide told us to go in front of everyone so that we could zoomzoom while the others could go at a slower pace.\n\nI could tell our tour guide had gone on this trail many times, because he always stopped for everyone to catch up when the paths forked off (or he'd tell everyone to take the left trails), and he knew all of the areas where people had trouble.  He let us (the speed racers) dink around while we waited for everyone else, and helped guide the way for everyone across icky areas (not too many).  He seemed to really like his job (I would too), but he also definitely wanted it to be a fun experience for everyone else, which I thought he provided.\n\nIf you feel adventurous and don't mind a little (okay, a lot) of dust on your pants, shoes, jackets, and teeth, take a stab at Stellar Adventures' ATV tour.  It's a little costly at $165/person (our groupon took it down to $75/person), but it was incredibly fun, and I would do it again.  Just don't run into the mountain or flip your ATV over, like one of my friends did!

<review>The Desert Botanical Gardens are beautiful. I'm just amazed by all of the different types of cati that are on display here. It's a great way to get some exercise and enjoy the beautiful desert plants. They are blooming right now and the gardens look amazing. \n\nWe came to see the Chihuly exhibit yesterday (with some free passes, woo hoo!) just before sunset. You have to see this during the day and at night. Some pieces look better during the day and others look better at night. I would suggest going to see this exhibit during the week. It was pretty busy on a Tuesday night, so I can't imagine how busy they are on the weekend. \n\nIf you're into desert plants, Boyce Thompson Arboretum is another great place to check out near Globe. \n\nSome of the trails close at sunset, so get here before the sun goes down to check them out. And the butterfly exhibit closes at 5pm. Also they are now open until 9pm.
</review>
<review>Lunched here Monday.  Had read all of the reviews, so expectations were high.  And they lived up to them..\n\nAbout the place.  Family run, mother/daughter combo.  The son handles the web site and Twitter posts (check Twitter for daily specials).  They were very nice.  The mom kept bringing me food I didn't even order, just because I told her I would eventually try it.\n\nThe food:  I ordered a 3 item combo.  I was really only hungry enough for a 2 item, but for the sake of all of you, got the 3 so I could taste one more dish.  The chicken adabo was very simple and good.  Won't overwhelm you with flavor.  It is prepared using chicken wings, and they were hot and tender.  The spicy orange beef was very good.  Daily special I believe.  Very flavorful, with a hint of orange and red peppers.  Also tried the beef mechado, which I am told is one of their better burritos.  The potatoes that accompanied this surprised me.  I expected them to be a bit mushy, but they were perfectly crisp.  I chose mexican rice to go with it, but I believe they have garlic and white rice as alternatives.\n\nThey also gave me some of the cassava cake.  I am not a huge fan of coconut, but I tried and enjoyed it.  Also, they brought out a small sampling of their most popular item, the pork egg rolls.  They were almost like deep fried taquitos with a very unique flavor.  Served with sweet and sour, it is a MUST have!  They supposedly have to make 3,000 PER DAY!\n\nGo try it out.  No soda fountain, so you can get canned soda and drinks.  Eat in (cute decor) or take it to go.  Not great for large groups, but 2 or 3 would be OK..
</review>
<review>Two years ago, I was very disappointed that I was not able to go to the botanical gardens on a trip to Scottsdale.  However, I think that was a blessing in disguise because I wouldn't have gone there last week and seen the spectacular Chihuly exhibit.  We went to the dbg at five at night, which was a great time, because we were able to see the glass fixtures during in the daylight, at sunset, and then lit up at night.  All the pieces were beautiful, with vivid colors and intricate designs.  \n\nThe desert botanical gardens are a little microcosm of the desert world.  We visited Saguaro National Park two days prior and that was real, spacious, and wild desert.  However, if you are only in Arizona for a short time, the dbg will do.  The variety of cacti is so amazing and I'm sure the flowers are beautiful in April and May.  We saw some wildlife there such as rabbits and bees, but not anything like a snake, although I'm sure that's quite possible.\n\nWell worth the $!5 fee!  Also, their hours are great if you are looking to do something in the early morning or early evening.

<review>I love hole in the wall finds. I can't take credit for this find as my boyfriend took me here one afternoon for lunch. But, I think he knows that I'm a sucker for outdoor dining. Plus, it was gorgeously sunny outside. We both ordered some grub... I think I had a chicken burrito on my first visit. \n\nThis place is cash only, which is a huge pain in the butt these days. They do have an ATM in house, but it charges you a couple bucks to take out your cash.

<review>"""WOW--What a cool concept! They have a humongous, funky retail space, thats maybe half full of vintage fatigues.....old school soda bar....produce stand....home accessories  and  nic nacs etc..... On the other side there's an eclectic old bar that was transported to AZ from a Chicago jazz club(Super cool), old timey cocktails  and  beers.....The Margarita was a bit too tart(due to--too much \fresh lime juice\""""-def ask for a lil extra agave nectar) but the brisket sliders were to die for  and  the Noodle Krugel (SP.) was by far, one of the most amazing  mouth experiences I've had in a while!!!

<review>Holy Chambord Margarita! Where have you been all my life???\n\nMy first time, we did happy hour. Service was slow, but the food and drink made up for it. We ordered three appetizers and two rounds of the delish chambord margaritas. I am not usually one for frozen drinks, but this was wonderful - like frozen raspberry lemonade with a great kick!\n\nMy second time, I went with a big group of kids and adults for lunch. Everything we ordered was perfect and delish and the service was great.\n\nThe third time, I went just for the chambord margerita on a friday night with my husband around 10pm. It was standing room only - packed - all the pre-clubbers were getting their drink on. \n\nI have been another handful of times just for the Chambord Margerita. The food is great, but the prices are a bit high for what you get. I will still frequent.
</review>
<review>My wife and I have been coming to JJ's since about 3 months after it opened, a little more than 3 years ago and we love it here.   They have great happy hour prices (no watered down margaritas for only $3) and they have the best salsa in town.  With two small children (3 and 1 1/2), this is a great place that we can come and experience a happy hour environment (responsibly, of course) with the children.  We always have great service and that make Juan Jaime's our favorite Friday night hang out.

<review>"""Two or three times a year, when my dad comes to town, we have to go eat a chicken fried steak at the Ranch House.  We heard about this place from our old roommate who is a chef, and my dad couldn't wait to go try it.  Typically a healthy eater, my dad loves to splurge on something artery-clogging from time to time.  I'm just glad I get to go along for the ride.  The first time we went, my dad noticed a not-so-svelte man sitting at a table in front of the window.  My dad looked toward him and said \Ooohh.  This is gonna be GOOD!\""""  He was right.\n\nThe chicken fried steak is tender and juicy, the eggs have always been perfectly fine and the gravy is so thick and creamy I can feel it taking years off my life.  Pancakes are an easy kid-pleaser, so everyone comes out full and content.  \n\nI'm glad I get to go here once or twice a year and that's enough for me."""""""
</review>
<review>"""In the commercial chain driven world that the Phoenix valley seems to be, it is always a welcome surprise to find a local family owned joint that fully lives up to the \diner\"""" moniker.  \n\nThe atmosphere here was pretty good and the food was great.  They seem to specialize in \""""American comfort food\"""" and have a huge menu that made it tough to decided.  And better still, we had a little impromptu conversation with the owner who also recommended some other great locally owned places.  \n\nWe'll definitely be back."""""""

<review>Thai food is one of my favorite types of cuisines. I have been going to Thai Rama for over 5 years now, and they are always consistent! this place is a little, hole in the wall type. (those are usually the best)\nWhenever I am having a thai fix I usually order the same items. Sometimes different... But not always. \nOK..\n1. Thai tea... the best in the valley! \n2. Pad thai with chicken... level 5 - 5 is usually med spice but to some ppl its very spicy... you can always lower the number to a 1 or 2 and it'll still be just as good.\n3. Yellow pork or chicken coconut curry with potatoes, onions, carrots,  and  pineapple.... level 5 again.... my fave\n4. There's one more beef dish that is absolutely delish! But, I forgot the name. Basically all it is, is thick rice noodles and thinly sliced beef stir fried.. Kind of like a chow fun but better!\n\nOh and I would also like to add that they have a very friendly waitstaff and pretty good service.\n\nIf you like Thai, check this place out!!!
</review>
<review>LOVE, LOVE , LOVE this place-as does everyone i have taken here.  The atmosphere is so great.  Big leather sofas, dimly let, chandeliers and HIGE bar in the center of the place.  it's small, swanky, sexy and has a great old school feel.  Plus ladies-i've never seen so many chic good looking guys in one place at once, it was jaw dropping ;)\n\nScottsdale needed a place like this-cozy and classy and reasonably priced.  So happy to have this in my backyard-a must try.
</review>
<review>I have been going here regularly for about a year. Dave was the first  medium I had ever met. I did a private reading with him and can say that he is the real thing. It gave me a lot of closure. Ray who usually works in the front is very friendly and helpful. \n\nSimia who does tarot readings there is amazing. She seems to know things that she couldn't possibly have known when doing my readings. Very specific and accurate. She's very nice too. \n\nCatherine does palm readings and it was very accurate. \n\nI love the aura photos here. It  comes out on a polaroid film (unlike some other places who use a different type of camera) and is very clear.  \n\nOverall a great place.
</review>
<review>This was the second stop on our (VinVillage-Phoenix) little wine jaunt through Cave Creek this weekend. The $5/glass happy hour special was a steal. Or if you prefer, get a bottle to share, which several of us did. They have an amazing selection, all handpicked (and probably verified) by the owners. Nancy wasn't there, though I have talked with her before, and she is great - but Bryan kept things moving along for us. Nice interior decor, with some sofa areas and western-themed barstools, and also a quiet patio. Easy to miss if you don't know it's in Stagecoach Village off Cave Creek Road. The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is that they do not serve food - though they will order it from a sub shop across the way (but that doesn't really complement the wine, now does it?).
</review>
<review>"""Bottom line: any theatre that brings Rocky Horror back to Mill Ave gets 5 stars just for that. (See, I'm not hard to please.)\nAnd they showed Showgirls here the other night. I MISSED IT (!) but again, any theatre that shows Showgirls on Mill Ave gets 5 stars. \nThey also do live music performances and about a million other cool things here, but for me, it's all about Rocky Horror. \n\nI think (i.e. hope) that MADCAP signals a change back to the \old\"""" Mill Ave. The things that are going on here are the best reuse of this old building. Thank you to all the people who made this happen."""""""
</review>
<review>This has become a standard meet up location for me after a long day at work. I love the atmosphere and the music is always spot on. Weekday evenings it has just the right mood - not over crowded ever - so you are able to carry on a conversation without issue. Parking can be a slight issue competing with Pei Wei and Starbucks but  you forget all that when you walk up those SideBar stairs. Great place to catch up and relax after a long day at work.
</review>
<review>Do you want authentic Japanese food, drink, little toys, book, free newspaper? Don't waste no time, and come to Tokyo food market. This is Da place!!\n\nI found this place by accident, to my surprise this turns out fully stocked Japanese grocery / convinience store from heaven. And pricing was juuuust right!! \n\nThe owner is very very nice gentleman, I chat with him a while and found out how much of knowledge he has for Japan and Japanese biz. \n\nI ended up more than I needed, but I'm very happy to go home with so many Japanese grocery items. \n\nThis is true gem in town!
</review>
<review>Came here with a friend for the first time a few months ago, but it must have been around the time that service sucked because I was disgusted with our server and vowed to never return. \n\nWe decided to try it again today for lunch, and boy was this time better! I feel like the owner realized that his waitresses were shitty so he found replacements. He also made it a point to stop in and greet everyone at the restaurant which I thought was really nice.\n\nWe sat at the bar and service was fantastic. If our server wasn't around, another waitress would even ask if we were doing okay.\n\nAs for the food - I have officially given up on RA and moved here because this place was just great! We had the lunch boxes that come with miso soup, cucumber salad, wokked veggies, rice, and your choice of a main dish (regular meat plates or a choice of a specialty roll). We went with the Las Vegas rolls. You get all of that food for $15 and walk out of there feeling full.
</review>
<review>I can't believe I've never reviewed this place before. I've been here countless times before, and watched the place get upgraded and remodeled several years ago.\n\nI can't remember the first time I came here, but it was some time ago after I moved out here. The convention center has an older part thats smaller, and a new addition that's huge!  Plenty of events are held here all year round, from sporting events like the NBA all star game, to the auto show, they had an NRA convention a couple years ago with a zillion people, along with other regular yearly events like the auto show and several others.\n\nThe place is large, and has 3 levels (a basement area, main level and upper level) with a crosswalk to get to the other side which is pretty darn cool. It's huge, spacious, and modern looking with its updates.  Escalators, stairs, etc.  The place is sparsely decorated with Arizona stuff that makes it really cool looking. They also have a cool light feature outside that illuminates the walkway with different colors at night and is really pretty to look at as well.\n\nThe cool thing about it is too is that its easily accessible via light rail, and you don't have to spend $$ on parking...and let me tell you, the parking here isn't cheap! $12 for the garage, $10 in lots around, and its not any cheaper the farther away you get.  I don't know why anyone would want to park down here, since the light rail is $3.50 round trip, so save yourself a few bucks and take the rail. You'll thank me later!\n\nThere's also food and dining in here as well, with a variety of different style resturants, but again, its outrageously expensive!  They have a starbucks here too, which is their regular prices, but is like an extra $5 a person to eat here, so dine elsewhere before you come in here.  (minus the coffee since Starbucks is the only reasonably priced place in here.)  Plus, the convention center is a hop, skip and a jump from about a zillion other cool dining places that your better off eating at anyways, so do that instead.\n\nAside from that, this place is pretty huge, and its worth checking out. Plenty of clean pretty bathrooms and tons to do in and outside of the center with variety of different sized spaces to hold any kind of event, large or small.

<review>"""I'm a member of the zoo, so I have the opportunity to visit quite frequently.  I do recommend zoo membership to anyone with children or anyone who wants to lose some weight (walking around the zoo is a lot more interesting than walking around the block).  \n\nSince I have lived all over the country, I have had the opportunity to visit a lot of zoos:  The San Diego Zoo, The Oakland Zoo, The San Francisco Zoo, The Bronx Zoo, The Tampa Zoo, The Fort Worth Zoo, The Brookfield Zoo, The Lincoln Park Zoo and a few more I am sure I am missing.  Of all the zoos I have visited, I would say The Phoenix Zoo is in the top three, with The Tampa Zoo or The Oakland Zoo (at Knowland Park) being my favorite to date.\n\nHighlights of the Phoenix Zoo?  \n\nEveryone must see the Orangutan habitat, which is really quite nice.  I love watching the baby Orangutan swing and play; my daughter could watch him all day long.  \n\nThe Monkey Village is also a riot.  There are 16 monkeys and only two of them are males.  It is a female dominated society!  Sometimes they even banish the males to the front of the enclosure.  Watch out for falling pee, though.  Those girls like to mark their territory!  Keep your hands off the ropes, for sure!\n\nThe Komodo Dragons are also neat, as you don't often see those at zoos.\n\nThe pedal boats are a fun addition to a day at the zoo ($8 for 20 minutes for members).  \n\nThe one thing I don't like about the zoo is that you are sort of nickle-and-dimed for things.  For example, just for the kids to touch the Sting Rays, members pay $2 and visitors pay $3.  Also, you have to pay $4 per person to feed the giraffes and children under 12 MUST be accompanied by a paying adult.  At The Tampa Zoo, to feed the giraffes you just need a quarter or two to buy the feed.  And you can stay with the giraffes as long as you want!  At The Phoenix Zoo, you have a limited time \turn\"""" to feed the giraffes.  You only get a handful of feed, as well.  It is very disappointing to giraffe lovers like me!\n\nOverall, I enjoy the layout and feel of this zoo.  My daughter especially loves the play areas, like the treehouse and the pirate ship.  \n\nIt is nice that they open an hour early for members, especially in the hot Summer months.  \n\nThat said, you won't find me at the zoo at 6 a.m.!  I am still in bed!\n\nP.S. Don't miss the Galapagos Tortoise.  At feeding time, you are sure to see a rogue hare dart in and out of his enclosure as he slowly makes his way to his food.  The Tortoise and The Hare make a great photo opp!"""""""

<review>We live closer in (Phoenix) so rarely have cause to head north for breakfast.  We found this place on Yelp and decided to try it.  In the genre of traditional diners, this is a gem.  The food is simple, well prepared and cheap, and the service is great (super friendly staff).  One of the people in my group ordered the pork chop breakfast.  It was somewhere around $8 and enough food to fill two hungry people.  If this place is in your flight path and you like old time greasy spoon breakfast joints check out Tiny's (and avoid the lines in Central Phoenix)
</review>
<review>Nice ambiance for a sports bar.  Not too loud during lunch hour.  They also offer wifi, so you can get your work done during lunch.   I ordered the Ruben Sandwich and it was excellent!   One of the top 3 I've ever had!  Rye was toasted just right, corn beef was flavorful and tender (not tuff like some places) and not too much dressing to overwhelm flavor, but just to enhance.   Service was great!  Host sat me near a location with an outlet for my laptop.   She was very cheerful and kind.  Server was very attentive and helpful.  Food was quick.  It wasn't very busy when I went in there.  But would definitely head back there if in area.  For a sports bar/restaurant,  a real winner.
</review>
<review>Haven't been here in quite awhile, but this is a pretty great place to have a bite to eat.  It would get 5 stars from me, but unfortunately I went on game day and the volume on the game was so loud it was a bit off-putting.  I know it's a bar and football season so it's not unexpected .  If you are in the mod to watch the game it's a very good place to go.  The real standout thing are the beer bread sandwiches.  They are more of a wrap than a sandwich, but very good either way.  At our table we had the mushroom one, chicken one, and the italian beef one all of us gave them high marks.  They also come with some pretty awesome fries.  How do you make a fry better?  Dip it in beer batter!  \n\nTry:\n- anything with beer bread\n- ice cream cake

<review>When I donated my kidney a few months ago, Wendy from Petite Maison brought me 6 pints of soup. At the time, I had never met her, the chef or eaten there. How cool is that? After being on painkillers for several days, I was severely constipated. It happens. The lentil soup she brought over did the *ahem* trick, though!\nI finally got to go there last weekend for their late night Staff Meal, which was dessert-themed. My friend Leslie made all the desserts. \nThe service was great, except for having to ask for water twice. There weren't many people there, but it was also after hours, so I'll forgive it because it was such a cute place!\nIt feels like a ski lodge inside. There is wood everywhere! Cute chandeliers over the tables, too. \nOh, and the bathroom was nice. Not too fancy, but nicer than most places.\nI will definitely come back here for a regular meal, but I wanted to get the word out about this place.\nGood people, who care about others in the community. Great atmosphere and for being in Old Town, douchebag-free.

<review>Kitchen 56 is a nice neighborhood restaurant and they continue to improve.  We went once when it was Vatra and would not have returned had it stayed the same.  The free parking across 56th Street is a nice addition.   As is the new menu.  \n\nWe've gone for dinner with the kids in the late Spring, 2011- I had the burger and it was big and delicious.  My daughters giggled with delight when they saw their kid's spaghetti plate- three separate small bowls on a long, narrow platter.  One bowl had noodles, one had the 'sauce on the side' and the other a fruit salad.  Great price at $6.  My husband opted for the Ahi dinner- that was the bummer choice of the evening.  The ahi tuna steak lacked the flavor and texture I expect at $21 a plate.  It was cooked rare, so that wasn't the issue- just cut and quality of the fish.  The wine selection is ok, but the waiter didn't really know the nuances  between the wine by the glass, yet.  \n\nThe patio is lovely and nice to see neighbors we know.  Since it is a neighborhood restaurant, it would be nice to be welcomed by the owners or management from time to time.  UPDATE:  I returned for lunch with a girlfriend in May, 2011.  The owner spent quite a bit of time chatting with us and explaining menu choices, their remodel, etc.  She was trained by their general manager and is the day manager.  Nice touch!

<review>One of the bigger Asian/International food markets in the city, Super L Ranch Market is a great destination for getting hard-to-find Asian produce, meats and poultry (ever try looking for black chicken in your local supemarket?), and frozen and packaged goods. It also has a great bakery -- it's where I get my chiffon cake fix. And if you want a fast Hong Kong style meal, there's Hong Kong Express, a small eatery at the corner of the supermarket. Since it is in the Chinese Cultural Center, you can plan an entire afternoon there: grocery shopping at the Ranch Market, a meal in one of the restaurants in the complex, shopping for Chinese decorative items and clothing in the stores there, and even consulting a practitioner of Chinese traditional pulse diagnosis at the herbal store (see my review of Healthy Chinese Herbs Co.) if you're into alternative therapies for ailments.
</review>
<review>Was pleasantly surprised after choosing to eat here solely because we were exhausted after a 7 hour drive.  The brussel sprouts au gratin were phenomenal and the grilled pork chop was done perfectly.  The service is efficient and not obtrusive.  Not sure what the normal crowd here is since we only spent a night in Scottsdale, but seemed like it was a popular destination for girls trying to replicate their own versions of a southwest SATC night out. Definitely recommend going here if you ever find yourself in Scottsdale.
</review>
<review>This place is fantastic and cheap. The flavors are hand crafted an real, not the product of the flavor syrups that every other yogurt shop buys from the same company. There are new flavors all the time, so you should check in at least once a week.\n\nThe owner is there working the shop from 11 to 11 every day, so you'll always get great service and he's open to suggestions about new flavors.\n\nIf you like frozen yogurt, you have no excuse for not patronizing this place. Try it out!

<review>Lots of character, with oldies playing over head...\n\n-Ordered Bristo Classic Pizza\n-Stuffed Mushrooms\n\nService was quick n food came out fairly quick.\nThe stuffed mushrooms were amazing, bursting with flavor and oozing (yes, I said oozing) with cheese.\nThe Pizza was well balanced and the toppings were extremely fresh.  The crust was fine, but nothing super.  Yes, it was better than CPK pizza, but still not the best that I've had (in OC or Phx).  But perhaps that was the down fall.\nComparing to other greats ... puts this place at a disadvantage. But if I'm used to only CPK, then I'd be very impressed.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this place has lots going for it and the overall experience was fun and super laid back yet with service that was awesome.  But compared to other pizza places eaten less than 24 hrs ago ... I'd say it isn't worth the long drive if you're coming from South of the 60.

<review>"""I love little Mexican Restuarants like these. Seems to be family owned, and very clean! The food is awesome, large portions, and authentic. The menu has a decent variety; it's more of a \to-go\"""" establishment as it is very small. The food rocks, nonetheless and prices are perfecto.\nWe don't have very many restuarants like this in Surprise, so this is my little gem. They close pretty early, so if you're craving a late night Mexican dinner, hang on til lunchtime the following day. Thumbs up =)"""""""

The dough tastes slightly sweet and is fluffy..It's what makes the pizza so great and there is a brickoven!! I love it! My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads.

<review>I saw an ad for this restaurant in a magazine and decided to give it a try.  Good marketing I guess?  We drove up and although it was a bit hidden, the view is amazing.  The inside is really pretty - nice touches to make you feel like you are in a native American dwelling.  \n\nWe started with the 3 sisters salsas and chips.  OMG the chips were all homemade and delicious - there was a warm bread/soft taco and then the tortilla chips.  The salsas were all really good and interesting.  Each one had a different flavors and the portions were huge - easily enough for 4 people.\n\nI ordered the BLT with house salad.  The dressing was delicious I seriously would have bought some if they bottled it.  The sandwich was huge!  Slices on avocado and huge strips of bacon, what more could you ask for?\n\nThis was one of the best meals I've had in Arizona and I'd go back in a heart beat.

<review>Waited 25 minutes with about 50 people on a Sunday evening.. all i can say is WORTH THE WAIT  and  THE PRICE \n\nThe service is great the food comes out fast and they are constantly cleaning the buffet areas (cause we are all pigs!). The selection is everything from BBQ chicken and fries to a sushi  and  tempora stand, Mongolian wok, plenty of sea food, crab legs, 15 different kinds of shrimp, all you favorite Chinese buffet items, and some strange surprises. Escargot(snails) and lotus bean leaf wraps, squid, octopus, kimchi Duck, muscles, clams, asparagus. over 200 items. \n\nDessert is from fresh fruit, canned fruit, pastries cookies cakes AND 8 self scoop BRYERS ice cream flavors! \n\ncons, The need some form of table waiting buzzer systems  and  they need pics for the escargo and crab legs. other than that perfect.

<review>"""Geisha is the place to be! Luckily for me everytime I've gone here it's been happy hour! So the sushi is half off, plus the house drinks and all the flavor infused sake is too! I have done a girls' day here and it was so much fun! We ate so much sushi and got a pretty good buzz going for a decent price and walked around old town afterwards. Upon checking my account later, i realized the waitress put an extra $40 on my tab, which was frustrating, because I had to come back and speak with the manager. The manager was kind of annoyed because he had to go back in the records and find my transaction using my credit card to fix the problem. When he came back he apologized and said he would buy me a drink for my troubles. I actually had other plans so I said \get me next time.\"""" So, next time I came with some friends and told the waitress the manager agreed to buy me a drink. When the bill came they had comped all of our drinks! I have since been back many times and have always had a great experience. The atmosphere is great whether you are seated inside or on the patio."""""""

<review>I've been wanting to go here for a while! I'm just never in Glendale so I finally made the drive out there to try this place for lunch. Service was great! While waiting for my food, the cook even brought me a sample of Beet Soup that he just made to test it. I had the Kielbasa and cheese pierogis and it was great comfort food. The kielbasa was juicy and the pierogis has a great flavor to them. I even used the leftover kielbasa in my scrambled eggs the next day. :)

<review>I would reccomend this dance studio to any parent.  The teachers are great.  They're fun and full of energy.  My daughter started dancing here when she was 4 years old, and her teacher Kim, has really helped her develop a love for ballet.  My daughter has been taking classes there for 4 years and I can't complain about a single class she's been in.   Most of the teachers grew up dancing in the studio so there is a real family atmosphere.  5 Stars!

<review>"""I have been to Merc Bar numerous times since this is one of my friends favorite places to grab drinks. Me and the girls decided to come here on a Saturday night recently to celebrate her b-day and it was super packed by 9:30PM. This place is definitely a little gem and the ambiance very surprising when you walk in. I love that most of the time it's just dark enough and there's usually a good mix of music playing; I also love that there is always an eclectic mix of people here ranging from people on first dates, b-day parties, to \that guy\"""" trying to look cool at the bar.  After living in Vegas for 7+years I can say that this is actually a real lounge. I've found that many places in AZ claim to be lounges but when you walk in it's a full on club with super loud music and people dancing every where and little to no seating. At Mer Bar there's plenty of seating and the music is just loud enough to create that lounge like setting but you can actually hold a convo. \n\nBe advised that the drinks are not cheap! A specialty cocktail or martini goes for minimum $12 a pop so be prepared. Their food selection isn't that large so the only thing I've tried was their cheese and cracker platter which was perfect to snack on. Service is pretty hit or miss, on our last visit there was only 1 lady working the entire place, she said the other person called in but we had no complaints since we were having an awesome time chatting. All in all a good spot to start or end the night!"""""""

<review>I really liked this place.  My wife and I tried it based on the other positive reviews on Yelp, and we were not disappointed.  I had the paradise bacon CHZ burger with cheddar cheese and jalapeno ranch dressing.  The burger came with lettuce, tomato, some variety of onion that was unusual and cucumber too.  The bun was thin, light and toasted - I found it to be a much better bun than your typical dense, soggy burger bun.  The burger consisted of two very thin patties and had a nice grilled taste.  I've eaten a lot of burgers in the valley, and this was a very tasty burger.  \n\nMy wife got the paradise CHZ burger and subbed in a portobello mushroom for the burger.  She said this is her favorite burger place in the valley and she wants to go back.  I take that as a serious endorsement from someone who generally does not like burgers.  \n\nWe also each ordered the sweet potato tater tots and those were good too.  For drinks, we both opted for glasses of water, and they offered water with cucumber which was very satisfying, and much better than the typical nasty tap water you find most places.\n\nThe staff was super friendly and it was quiet inside so we could carry on a conversation easily.  Our total tab was just under $20.\n\nWe will definitely go back and I'm going to try one of their milkshakes next time.  \n\nUnpretentious, great food, great value for money, relaxing environment and friendly staff.  Check it out!

<review>The tacos at this place are little bundles of goodness that are damn near perfection. To begin the carne asada has great flavor with a slightly charred and crispy exterior, but still manages to maintain some tenderness on the inside. The cabbage, guacamole, and salsa are a necessary addition to this masterpiece of a taco. And just when you think you have it all... bam! Grilled onions complete one of the best tacos in Phoenix. On top of it all, these bad boys are only $1 a piece. \n\nNow on to the less glamorous side of Taqueria Los Yaquis, or the underbelly if you will. The establishment is inconspicuously housed just west of 7th Ave on Camelback Rd under a tent with some plastic tables and sporadic misters outside of Charlies gay bar. Here you will find some flaming fairies and hordes of legit Mexicans flocking in from all angles. Once you reach your destination you can watch the cooks working tirelessly in a food truck (one of the cleanest I've seen) to prepare you meat-filled pockets of love. God bless them. \n\nThere are two ordering lines: one is literally a hole-in-the-wall inside Charlie's and the other a general line outside which accommodates all. This dual line and alternating order-taking results in ridiculously long waits of up to 20-30 minutes. I prefer to go on Sunday afternoons when it gets real, and a lil' less... uh... gay.

<review>So I met a friend there for dinner last night and the joint was jumpin'!  i was absolutely floored by the tomato soup...OMG, it was just delicious!  I also had the sesame tuna for my main course...it was only OK, cooked too much for my taste.  It's a cute place and the staff is really well trained so that was really a nice treat.  I don't know if I will make this a regular since it's so far away but it has potential.  NOW, if they had a good happy hour, it might become a stop.  Just sayin'
</review>
<review>Love this place!  Went for a stay-cation with the girls for a spa day and stayed the night.  I can't wait to go back!  You are in the city but feels miles away!  The spa is amazing!  Wonderful adults only pool with great refreshing food and drinks.  Then our rooms were clean and comfortable.  Dinner at Kai was nothing short of superb, and breakfast the next morning on the patio over looking the golf course and pool area was also very good.  Overall a wonderful night away.

<review>"""This is a solid 3.5 for me, but I'll round it up to a 4 since our server was awesome. \n\nMy friend invited me to an art showcase that was hosted here, and I was little wary of a \hipster\"""" event being held at a sports bar, but I bought in. We got there and from the outside, C and W doesn't look like much of a sports bar. They have a really nice patio area that was decked out for the event. It was a little warm upon arrival so after making our initial rounds, we sat inside for a bite and a drink. \n\nMe and Jon S. were a little indecisive, so after asking our server, we ordered the Italian Nachos, Chicken Fingers, a D-Bomb and Tropical Vacation. I had had the italian nachos at another restaurant and was pretty unimpressed, so I was hoping that these didn't suck. The nachos were bomb. I can't say that everything was \""""farm fresh\"""", but it had the right amount of everything on it (cheese, sauce, olives, beef) and hit the spot. The chicken fingers were also good. Not greasy, just good ol' fashioned chicken fingers. And we both enjoyed our drinks, all for a total of about $20. \n\nNow the event we went to was pretty cool, and C and W was a good venue for it. I'm not sure if I'd ever frequent the place on my own since I'm not huge into sports, but if I was in the area and needed a place to go, I'd definitely stop by."""""""

<review>The boyfriend and I stopped in Metro on a Sunday morning while wandering Old Town in search of brunch.  I had been wanting to stop in here for some time... Wish I had made it in sooner! We sat indoors after deciding it was too warm on the patio (I might've been a lil hungover) and they were very nice about relocating us.  \nOn to the food... I ended up ordering the chicken salad on croissant. Yummm! The golden raisins and sliced apples made this sandwich delectable.  It also seemed there was some kind of marmalade on the sandwich.  The boyfriend had the salmon and ate every morsel on his plate, but admitted to jealousy that mine was better.  Service was really good, food was very good.   I'm hoping to get back and try their happy hour and late night menus some time soon!

<review>Love this local bookstore!  Seriously one of my favorite places to go to in the valley.  Doesn't hurt that it's in a great spot connected to a Wildflower Co and close to a Trader Joe's, but the store itself is so cozy.  I love to walk around this place for hours and go through everything.  It's rare that I don't find something I want even if it's just a 10 minute quick browse.  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because they don't have a computer book section.  Oh well, I'd probably be there all the time if they did.
</review>
<review>"""This store has such a variety of imports all cramped in a store not much bigger than my bedroom at home. They don't have a back room, so what you see is what you get. \n\nI haven't ever really bought a vast amount of items here, but it is still fun to look around. They have a wide assortment of ponchos (I love the ones with the llamas on them), cute purses/bags, jewelry and knick -knacks. The prices are pretty affordable, too. \n\nAnd don't forget to get your free bracelet when you go there...\one per customer, per lifetime\"""". I think I have five."""""""

<review>Not sure about the new parking situation at Biltmore Fashion Park, but the additions of Lulu Lemon, Apple Store, and True Food Kitchen are a draw for me... and I happen to really like the Macy's at Biltmore too.  Oh, and the under pass that was built for pedestrians to go the the Esplanade is a plus.  However, the best part about this place is that Minnie can go shopping with me!\n\nAnywhere that Minnie is welcome is a huge plus in my book!

<review>Dr. Sam and his staff are the best.  He is experienced, knowledgeable and kind - to both the animals and the people who love them.  I have moved and now drive 45 minutes to see him with no complaints.  He not only is a wonderful vet who takes his time with each patient, he will tell you when he doesn't know something, needs to do research, or will refer you to a great specialist.  He also is very cost-conscious and while I will do whatever I need to with my animals, it is appreciated that he understands that not everyone can afford to do everything.  He gives options and never forces expensive tests or tries to order anything that is unnecessary.  He also works with a local rescue organization, which shows his compassion and care for the community.

<review>"""If your out cougar hunting and coming up empty, go to The Vig. Its like a scene out of National Geographics. I've definently had my fair share of kills here, but thats not why I go. Just like Georgeanne says below, I live extremely close. Roughly 30 seconds closer then her and my walking stride might be longer so I'd say about 7 minutes walking and 6 power walking. I am a MASSIVE fan of getting drunk and not having to drive home. Whether its cabbing it, hitch hiking, or walking, I will not get a DUI. The food here is slightly above great and below \drop your pant and put yourself in it' amazing. The beer selection is good, not great, but they rotate drafts quite often which is nice. The staff is extremely friendly and courteous. I think I've hit on the hot manager nearly everytime I've been in and still cant remember her name. The patio is the shit! Its larger then the inside part and it has botchiball. Drinking+botchiball=funny Kodak moments!"""""""

<review>I'm no expert on Vietnamese cuisine, but my first experience at Little Saigon made me want to learn more.  This place is wonderful, and you should try it next time you find yourself in Glendale.  The fun begins before you're even seated, as the restaurant is in a little old house.  The tables aren't jammed together and the artwork is eye-pleasing and relaxing.\n\nFriend and I were impressed by the friendly, quick service.  But the food impressed us even more.  We had the potsticker appetizer, one of the best ever... not the sticky white dough typically found in a Chinese restaurant potsticker, these wraps are more like a thin French crepe, beautifully browned, filled with pork and veggies.  The dipping sauce on the side was delicious, though we also made use of the condiments provided at every table, namely fish sauce, sriracha, chili-garlic paste, and soy sauce.\n\nWe had two salads... #96, jellyfish salad with shrimp, pork, julienned  carrots and other veggies, and some herbs... and the #97, the lotus root and shrimp salad, also containing pork and julienned veggies.  Either salad could pass as a meal and we got the SMALL versions.  The flavors are off the charts on both, savory, herby, ginger, fennel, just delicious.  \n\nFor entrees we got the #51, lemongrass chicken, and #55, bite size pork ribs with caramelized onions.  Both arrived at the table in clay hotpots, still bubbling, and were savory and satisfying.\n\nWe have resolved to go back to try the pho (which looked very good as we ogled our neighbors' tables) and other tempting offerings.  This place deserves the 5 stars, and your business.  You'll thank\n me!

<review>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place!  We were DEFINITELY skeptical of coming here because well, it's a Thai AND Sushi restaurant.  Unless it's some sort of fusion place, we normally stay clear of restaurants that offer two different styles of food at one location (like those restaurants that serve Chinese and Mexican!)  We are SO glad we looked past our issues!\n\nWe've been back three times now, and let me tell you, each time has been consistently good.  The first two times we had appetizers and sushi.  They really DO have one of the best happy hours around - half priced apps AND pints of Kirin - DRAFT (i can't remember - I believe for $3.00).  The main point being Kirin on draft!  There is such a difference between Kirin out of a bottle and fresh from a tap, and it's so awesome they have it here! Score!\n\nThe appetizers were all awesome - fresh spring rolls, chicken satay, tempura - all very generous portions.  Miso soup was as it should be - comforting and light - and not too salty!  Then, we ordered our sushi.  The rolls are generous, the himachi and salmon was super fresh - and the sushi chef was super nice and accommodating.  Super creative sushi - some of which I have never seen before!   We are definite fans!\n\nThe third time we came here - we were ready for some Thai!  My fiance, our friend and I ordered apps to share.  Our friend ordered the Thai Basil with shrimp - and he was crying.  He said it was super spicy but super good.  I did not try his dish but could tell by the tears falling from his face he was not joking.  My fiance and I shared the glass noodle dish. We LOVE glass noodles - and they were cooked perfectly. Not too sticky or starchy, with just the right amount of spice.\n\nThe decor is truly gorgeous, and everyone is soo super nice here.  The one bad thing is that Narai is consistently empty. It is deceiving - being located in the same plaza as Four Peaks brewery when you see a ton of cars in the parking lot.  But most of the cars are for the brewery.  The restaurant has been empty everytime we've dined here - which really scares us because we'd hate to lose such a North Scottsdale gem!  I can't stomach places like Ra, or Kona Grill.  It's so refreshing to have an authentic sushi and Thai restaurant in the area!\n\nI would highly recommend trying it out!  With so much variety and such a friendly, helpful staff - you're bound to find something you like!  If not - just have a happy hour beer! ;)

<review>Now I wish I would have actually gone to pick up my samich instead of sit at work and wait for it's arrival.  I had heard very good things about this deli, so when i finally got bored of the same ole lunch I bring to work every day it was time to get in on this following.  I had the italian sub on wheat bread.  Um, talk about Freshness!  I'm pretty sure I ate the whole thing in like 3 minutes because I just couldn't get enough.  The bread was so soft, the meat was outstanding, and the provolone was real!  Alll it had was oil and vinegar on it with lettuce tomato and the typical italian meats.  I normally cannot eat a sandwhich without mayo and mustard, specially some spicy brown.  That was wonderful, but now after reading these reviews, it's time for me to check out that Chicken Salad, I love chicken salad.
</review>
<review>True Food is awesome. It's great to find a place that has really good HEALTHY food!! Have been here on many,many occasions and it's always been a great experience. The shrimp and goat cheese pizza is a favorite but I've really liked everything I've had here with one exception...the butternut squash ravioli, I could do without this dish. Service is friendly and helpful and I dig the patio when it's cool enough to sit outside. Sam Fox seems to know how to do it up right. Thumbs up!

<review>Finally a Carls Jr in Surprise.  I have only been waiting like 7 years!!!  I was commuting to Litchfield Park to get my Western bacon cheeseburger or famous star fix.....\nWhat is even more interesting is the fact that the new Carls Jr in surprise has all new staff and they must have been trained to be polite and courteous???  Not that often that I stop at fast food and get super polite and courteous from the teenager employees.  \nWhen I think Carls Jr, I think big sloppy burgers, forget the diet and dig in.  Plus who can pass up a $2 bacon western burger?  Bacon, fried onion rings, barbecue sauce, cheese, and meat?  Can't really ask for more?  I workout out to eat stuff like this :P\nEnjoy it.....\n\nOff of Grand in the Lowes parking lot, tricky parking lot location, but worth navigating the yellow bumps and arrows to get to Burger heaven.  Yes Carls Jr makes the best fast food burgers :)

<review>Sky Harbor International is a unique airport in that the rental car companies are located off premises in a separate building. However, I found that not to be a problem. Sky Harbor provides shuttle buses to the rental car building. The shuttle bus area is well marked and they even have people helping you get on the shuttle buses. Finding Avis Rent A Car was a breeze.\n\nThe Avis counter is well designed and well laid out. If you're a regular Avis customer then you can locate your name on the board and then proceed on downstairs to your rental car. This was my first time with Avis so I had to check in at the counter.\n\nThe counter people were helpful and friendly. As is common in this industry they do all they can to sell you upgrades and extra insurance. However, I always bring along a copy of my auto insurance and I hold my ground about the upgrades.\n\nAfter check in you proceed downstairs to your rental car. If you have luggage you are advised to use the elevator. After seeing a woman and her luggage thrashed on an escalator in Frankfurt airport I can understand this policy.\n\nIn the downstairs area Avis has a coded system to help you locate your rental car. My key was in the car door. A very nice young lady helped me set up my GPS system and gave me directions to my Phoenix destination. Avis has a great web site and a frequent flyer type of program. Fell in love with my rental car and drove away feeling good about Avis Rent A Car.

<review>Ok, so I discussed it with my dad, and decided to give this place four stars ( I was going to give it five stars, but he convinced me that it wasn't 'special' enough to get five stars and then I decided that I would need to go again before making that decision. \n\nAnyway, I met my dad here for lunch yesterday at around 11:30 and the place had some customers, but wasn't crazy busy. We sat outside, and that was very nice. We decided to split the caesar salad with chicken and the chicken sandwich with the goat cheese and fig jam. The caesar was really good, the dressing tasted excellent and was tossed perfectly, and the chicken was also very flavorful, but the whole thing still had a light quality to it. It was tasty. The sandwich was also very good. I could taste each ingredient, which I like, the bread was good, crispy but soft at the same time, and the combo of flavors was really great. Also, the service was excellent, my water was never empty. \n\nSo I would most definitely come back here. I just think I need to try dinner here and some more complex dishes than what I got before I can give it five stars, but honestly, as far as sandwich places go, I liked this very much, better than pane bianco.
</review>
<review>Started my meal with the Stetson chopped salad. Absolutely brilliant, wish I would have thought of it myself. A memorable presentation and a must order. Next came the duck con fit relleno. A valiant effort but the mallard was too overpowered by the pepper and batter. For the main course I selected the exotic mushroom pan fry.  Beautiful variety of mushrooms, swimming in a savory gravy that mimics the loveliest Yankee roast that you've ever had. A meatless Friday would never be easier.\n\n A fun, eclectic, Scottsdale eatery.

We also got it deep dish.\n\nIT WAS SAUCY--just the way I like it.  The bacon (not the Canadian variety) was the taste that made the pie.

Go here."""""""

<review>I love this location, and I love this product.  \n\nI think the prices are reasonable considering the quality of product you are getting.  If you've only been to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location and hate it, give this one a try.  It's got a much better vibe and is a lot less packed.  \n\nWalked right in was helped, she grabbed what I needed and I was off.  It took all of 15 minutes even with picking out a totally new foundation then I used before.

Well, I know one thing, I'm a huge fan of Chef Jeff Krauss and Crepe Bar's former incarnation, \Truckin Good Food\"""" and have high hopes for the success of his newest venture.\n\nThe space is chill and if the experience at the friends and family pre-opening this weekend is any indication of the quality of the food and service, i'm betting they will be hugely successful.\n\nMy first bites included a buckwheat blini with candied almond mousse and strawberry basil, refreshing, light and tasty.

<review>My wife and I were looking for a change of pace for lunch on a Saturday and since there aren't many good sandwich places in the west valley we decided Heidi's sounded good.\n\nWhen we placed our orders they made the sandwiches right in front of us, Italian on a sub roll for my wife and a Reuben on marble rye for myself.  Wow, that bread was fantastic, you can tell that it's freshly made.  It's soft and moist, I loved it.  You get a choice of several types, but we stuck with the defaults.  The sandwiches were also generously piled with the ingredients, I had corned beef on sauerkraut.  The meat had great flavor and the sides were also quite wonderful.  You get your choice of potato salad, cole slaw, or chips.  I had the slaw and wife had the potato salad.  Both tasted better than store bought, but I think the sandwiches were the stars.\n\nThe store was roomy and open, it was fine for a deli.  The sandwiches were in the $6-$7 range.  There were soups and wraps as well.  We'll definitely be trying there again, as it's much better than Quizno's, Blimpies, and definitely Subway.
</review>
<review>Okay, I know this is not the best or most authentic sushi around. That said, it's a fun neighborhood place to go on a Friday or Saturday night, have a few drinks, and enjoy guilty-pleasure sushi. \n\nThe waitstaff was friendly and prompt, although the hostess was a bit awkward. I found it kinda odd that they check IDs at the door and give you a wristband, but it sort of reminds me of a waterpark, which is exciting I guess. \n\nThe happy hour specials are definitely the biggest reason to come here, but we got a little carried away since everything was discounted. It adds up fast if you aren't careful (read: after a few cocktails, whooo!)! I live nearby, so I'll probably be back soon.
</review>
<review>"""I honestly have no idea what I ate.  Nothing on the menu was familiar to me and when I tried to order certain things, I was told no.  I got pork something and pork something else in a combo plate.  It was damn good though.\n\nWe had tried some samples of things and I wanted the pork sample and then I saw some beef and pineapple thing on the menu that I really wanted.  I think I was told \no\"""" and that I had to order off the giant board on the side.  That didn't really make any sense to me since the menu above the food said it was their regular menu.  In any event, then I said that I wanted the pork thing that was on the menu (because it was the only pork thing on the side menu) assuming it was the thing I had sampled.  The girl then repeated the pork thing and then gave me two different kinds of pork things.  If this is all confusing to you, how do you think I felt standing there.\n\nAs I said, in then end, I was quite happy with my food.  Very flavorful and the price and quantity were great.  I will be back, without a doubt."""""""
</review>
<review>This place is a bit rough around the edges, but worth the adventure.  They have really good fried food, especially the shrimp.  The prices are decent and they have a bunch of different sauces.  My suggestion is to mix the Louisiana hot sauce with the ranch.  Employ that for all of your dipping delights.  If you are health-conscious or looking for a nice place to eat, then this might not be the place for you.  If you down for greasy goodness in a low-key setting, then this is where you should dine.

<review>"""Garrett did a fantastic job cleaning and detailing my vehicle. I have a 2012 Subaru WRX Sti and wanted to make sure the paint was maintained properly with a good washing and sealant application. Ive had several cars in the past ranging from Supras, M3, GTO, etc, so i'm somewhat of a car nut. I've also had some pretty sub par experiences with \other\"""" mobile detailers here in the East Valley. They would charge you and arm and a leg ($90-$100) and would only take 1 hour to complete the job using 1 person. Now im not an expert at math or anything, but unless they had more than 2 arms, a QUALITY detail sure as heck takes more than 1 hour, i know this from doing them myself. Quality work takes time, especially if you want it done right.\n\nGarrett was easy to work with, we set a time of 6am to start before it starting heating up outside. He showed up on time at 6, introduced himself, and started to work. Everything he has is self contained, so its very professional, he has everything he needs to complete the job. We discussed over the phone that it would take 2-3 hours to complete the detail because he had to use the polisher to apply the sealant. I would rather pay someone good money for a complete job, rather than a half assed job because they wanted to get done quickly.\n\nHe had great attention to detail and even used some cutting compound to remove some surface scratches i had not previously noticed. Overall a great experience and great quality work for this price, especially for the time he takes, also dealing with the Arizona heat. Highly recommended!"""""""

<review>"""Ok this was my 2nd time here and I think it worth a fair review. First of all Nimbus is a Tucson area brewery.  They have the brewery and a tasting room/restaurant like the one there in Tucson too. \n\nThat being said when I first came in my my Cats shirt the waitress said \go cats' and I felt like I was at Nimbus in Tucson:-).

We decided on Mac n cheese pizza, rye IPA, old monkey shine,and garden salads.  What can I say? The beer was great!!! And the salads were surprising good.

Anyways Yelp unlocked us a pizza and beer for 10 bucks so I brought my friend here for the Mac n Cheese pizza and IPA. Great and my friend loved it too. \n\nAll in all Nimbus is a great place. It's a little tucked away but very low key and friendly and plain old good beer and good pizza. Lots of TVs around and a huge patio. I will for sure be back here!"""""""

<review>Anyone who knows me well knows that I hate grocery shopping. Hate it. Recently I was introduced to Trader Joe's and this past weekend, I took my husband there for the first time. While I can't say I have fallen in love with grocery shopping, I have found that I can at least go to TJ's when need be.\n\nThe layout of the store is fabulous. It's just a big enough store to give you variety and some choices, but not big enough to overwhelm you, especially if you are not a seasoned grocery store veteran. The staff is very friendly and always willing to help you find something, and the check out clerks are chatty without being annoying. I really can't compare TJ's prices to those you would find at a regular big box grocery store, but according to my husband who does all of our grocery shopping and knows which stores are the best for certain items, he says that TJ's prices are comparable if not lower than other grocery stores.\n\nI like the pre-packaged salads, sandwiches, and wraps, which are perfect to take to work for lunch. In fact, I had a TJ's chicken caesar wrap for lunch today and it was delicious! Do make sure to check the dates before purchasing to ensure that if you aren't going to eat it that day that it will last for a few more days. The organic pesto pizza that can be found in the frozen section is also very good and just the right size for two people. I was a little disappointed in the Red Delicious apples that I bought (nicely priced at 49 cents each)...they didn't have the crunch to them that I appreciate, but I'm not sure if it was the quality of their selection or that I just did a crappy job of picking two apples.\n\nThis TJ's does seem to be quite popular especially given it's location in the same shopping center as Changing Hands and Wildflower, so if you go on a Saturday, I would suggest going early. We arrived at 11 am and it was quite busy and the parking lot was almost full.

<review>150th Yelp Review!! WOOT WOOT!!! \n\nIt's a Sunday afternoon date, which was nice because the weekend was action packed for me, so a lunch date was just right. He picked the place, I do like that when the man picks the place and he even scores big points with me because it wasn't a chain restaurant, not that he would know that I'm on this only eating at local places  and  Yelp about it mission this year lol. \n\nI didn't ask him where we were headed but was pleasantly surprised because we were at the Cofco Chinese Cultural Center, never been and have always wanted to go check out, was kinda disappointed in how small it was. Walked around and checked out a few things still wasn't sure of the reason we were here, then we walked into Szechwan Palace and I thought gosh this is cute little place.\n\nFrom the time we walked in I got the feeling he was a regular their and wondered how many of his dates he brought here LOL The ladies were happy to see him and were talking with him, I of course had no clue what was being said cuz they all were talking in Chinese.  \n\nGot to our table, had a very hard time trying to figure out what I wanted to try, I found lots of dishes that I wanted, he order chicken fried rice, I would up ordering mongolian beef extra spicy. Order came out and it smelled delish, and being a crazy obsessed yelper that I am I picked up my phone, turned the plate around to the best view and started to take pictures of the dish, date looked at me funny but didn't ask, guess his other dates don't take pics of their food LOL I could see the coating of the red chili oil on the beef and onions, the beef was tender and onions and peppers were perfect, only thing it was missing the heat of the spice. But I finished the entire dish, it was that good!  Next time I want to try beef with jalapeno, I bet that dish packs some heat!\n\n I look forward to coming back and trying out more of their menu, glad to have finally made it over to the cultural center! Food was delish, date went well, and it was a good day. Also when I checked in on Yelp, was offered a free desert with any entree, I'm saving that for another time!
</review>
<review>Had a great time on Friday night.  As my friend and I walked in she said it feels like a great place.  It had a warm and friendly atmosphere.  I don't remember the name of our waitress but she was great. We ordered beer first and I asked the waitress to surprise me with one she likes. That started off the fun.  She chose a very good one first, and an equally good one for the second and last.  My friend and I both had the fish and chips because we thought that would be a good choice for a British pub.  The dinners were very good.  The fish was battered just right, the. Ole slaw was perfect, and the french fries were not overdone. So the first time there was better than I expected and we will come back again and again.
</review>
<review>I ordered mild, but the food still had quite a kick.\n\nWith that being said, I enjoyed the food.  A rather large group of us went in at lunch time and were seated quickly and served just as fast.\n\nMost of us ate from their weekday lunch special (about $8 per plate).  The lunch special comes with soup and an egg roll.\n\nThe ambiance is nice.  Like a few other reviewers have suggested, you can't really guess what you're getting into from the strip mall appearance outside.\n\nOur waiter was nice and attentive.  He walked the fine line between participating in our group conversation and being creepy really well.\n\nThere are a few Thai places in this area, and Tottie's is one of the better.
</review>
<review>I am always a big fan of a place in Phoenix that is a BYOB. There aren't many around. I'm not a fan of the typical mark up on wines. Corkage is $10. I am not usually one for ordering soup, especially in 110 degree weather. I had the tortilla soup. I was very impressed. At $6 this is a real bargain. It was packed full of veggies and chicken, more like a stew than a soup. Our entrees last night were the Filet Mignon and the pork tenderloin. The Filet was cooked perfectly to order. The accompanying potatoes were tasty with a hint of citrus I believe. The pork was equally as good. The goat cheese on top was a nice addition. I have been here before and had less stellar meals. Surprisingly their specialty, the lamb shank, was not very impressive. It was not nearly as tender as it should have been. A shank should have the meat nearly falling off the bone. Ironically I have never had a dessert here so i can not comment on that.
</review>
<review>"""Vincent's was packed!  Everyone was craving pizza too!  The line moved so fast and with smiles. \n\nWe really enjoyed the cheese pizza!  The crust was great and the cheese was stringyriffic!\n\nThey have \barley pops\"""" on tap. They have Cannolis  and  Tiramisu for dessert! The menu looks awesome!  We will definitely be back to try the other great looking items!\n\nOur only negative, which is totally personal preference,  they have Pepsi products. The kids didn't mind, but I'm particular about my soda."""""""
</review>
<review>I am going to start this off by saying that my past experience with Pho has been less than satisfying.  I didnt really think I would like the stuff on the third try, but I am one of those kinds of people that is too stubborn to dislike food and I have to keep trying it.  You know - just in case the places I ate at before were terrible.\n\nToday, that mentality served me well.\n\nI had avoided the previous tenants of this particular location like the plague, due to their reputation for poor customer service, etc.\n\nNew company, new attitude.  The wait staff was very attentive and polite.  There was light classical music playing.  The restaurant was very clean.\n\nI had the Pho Tai Bo Vien with Jasmine Hot Tea.\n\nThe tea was hot - but not so hot that I couldnt begin drinking it right away.\n\nThe Pho was delicious.  Not to greasy.  Very flavorful.  The sprouts and basil that were served with it were fresh and crisp.\n\nAll in all, for 11 bucks, this was a good meal.  There are many other items on the menu that I would like to try, and the manager informed me that the menus is being expanded.  I will update this review in a few weeks.

<review>Consistant yummy deep fried goodness every time. This place for me is for the days my stress levels are super high. I like Petes for take out at this location. Not so much to eat at but for take out. They are making a new Pete's next door to the current location on Van Buren. So I'm hoping they level the current location  and  have some actual parking. That would just rock. This place is so busy at meal times it's hard to find a spot that the dirve thru doesn't block you in. Not that this would be a bad place to be stuck per say but... you'd have to roll me out if you left me there too long The burgers, fish, shrimp  and  sauce are all good. Now stop reading  and  get to eating your deep fried goodness.
</review>
<review>This place has great bread. Really fresh and chewy. The food is served fast and the price seems to be pretty good as well. The only 2 things that keep it from a 5 star is that the subs seem to lack originality, and they don't deliver late-night at this location. It reminds me a bit of Silvermine Subs and is maybe even a little better as far as taste.  The lettuce wrap subs are very original to this place. Although I would never eat one, my girlfriend was a fan.
</review>
<review>I am so grateful to say I have had the famous Rocket Burger.  This place gets so much Yelp praise and for great reason.  \n\nThe soda selection is off the hook every soda you grew up with and then some all in coolers in bottles the even got YooHoo.\n\nFries are all natural cut and amazing there is just something great about fries with the skin on them they just taste better. \n\nThe burger was Phenomenal I had the Santa Fe which had the amazing Rocket Sauce, bacon, and fried green chili.  It was outta this world good.  \n\nI will be a loyal customer and I am sure will post numerous updates to this review cause this place is just that good.

<review>"""I recently had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for a 3 day conference for Women on the Move.  The staff went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. They even brought us \Smores kits\"""" to roast by the pool at the fire pits!  They truly understand customer service.  We can't wait to come back.  They have a free shuttle (Red Cadillac Escalade) that can take you locally which was a big help since many of us needed to run out for things during our stay.  The property was exceptionally clean.  The rooms were recently renovated and very large.  I had a ground level room by the pool and it had a great patio with chairs to sit outside.  Only complaint was hallway noise during evening hours but it was not an issue.  Food was great!"""""""
</review>
<review>The children's museum is fun but it seems like every time I go it gets more and more expensive. They charge for every person over the age of 1, and it's currently 11 dollars a person. They do have a super cool 3 story climber but most adults agree it makes us all a little nervous to venture up there but the kids don't seem to mind at all. They have a car wash, an art room where you can paint a castle, a grocery store with carts and check out stands, a pizzeria, a race car ramp, and much more... But my favorite my thing of all is the noodle forest! It's an area of hundreds of pool noodles hung from the ceiling that you walk through, it's so much fun. :) The kids seem to want to go back over and over again even though it's pretty much the same thing and doesn't usually change much. But hey, if they are happy I am happy.
</review>
<review>so we wanted Chinese, and decided to eat at the restaurant. What awesome service. We started with the potstickers ($4.95). They were lightly pan fried. Perfectly chewy with a nice crisp on them. Wifey went with her go to dish, the amaaaaazing Singapore rice noodles with BBQ pork and Shrimp (8.95)  This dish is EASILY enough to feed three people. (yes, she brought most of it home) I went with the salt and pepper pork chops. If I could marry chinese food, this would be my bitch. Holy cow. Awesome thin cut pork chops breaded, salted and served with jalapenos and chives. I don't ever ever ever eat fried foods, but these were seriously one of the best chinese pork dishes ever. Overall, great great great. Super stoked that this place is right around the corner.
</review>
<review>Awesome, delicious lunch or dinner takeout place! Quite a dive in terms of decor, so don't expect anything fancy. There are folding tables and chairs, if I remember correctly.\n\nAnyway, I had jade red chicken and emperor's chicken quesadilla and both were SO GOOD. The idea of Chinese - Latino food sounds odd, but I'd heard of it before and just never had the chance to try it. They have all sorts of combos, mostly with beans or rice as a side (get it? chinese and latin food both usually come with rice....!). So before you knock it, if you're in Phoenix and looking for a place to eat, this is it!
</review>
<review>We contacted Kirk Conrado from one of the automatic notification services from Zip Realty. We didn't know anyone in the valley and he was FANTASTIC! We were out of state and would fly in often to see properties and he always made time for us. When we did find the house we wanted it was going through lis pendens and a real mess. He recommended and awesome attorney and we came out with a wonderful house, great deal, and someone we consider extended family - thanks, Kirk!\n\nKirk maintains the highest integrity of any realtor I know. He is fun, easy going, yet steadfastly aggressive and maintains and extremely professional attitude in all negotiations. Even though the seller's realtors were the nastiest we've ever dealt with, he rose above it all and maintained integrity and professionalism throughout each interaction.\n\nIf you don't know anyone in the valley, he's your person. We looked in Tempe, Chandler, Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Paradise Valley and he was familiar with each area. As we're really picky when it comes to both homes and the people we interact with, we appreciate his positive attitude, flexibility and friendly, yet persistent business acumen.

<review>I'm surprised to read the bad review about Sprouts. Honestly, I haven't bought a lot of their meat because I come for other things, but its never been a problem for me. \n\nI didn't know this before I went to this Sprouts, but I LOVE pink lady apples. They are also usually on sale too, which makes me happy (and even when they're not, they're cheaper than other places). Other things that make me love Sprouts: their corn muffins are delish, they have a regular bulk section, but they also have a bulk spice section. Who wants to pay friggin $3 for a tiny jar of spice, when you need a tablespoon for a recipe you're trying out? \n\nI assume they also have a good deli because I see people getting the lunch special here, but I've never tried it.
</review>
<review>"""I've been to the Tempe Improv many times, maybe more than I should fess up to, lol. It's always a great time! Purchase your tickets on-line  and  arrive at least 1 to 1 1/2 hours before your show time. It's first come first serve so you don't want to end up in the back. You need to be prepared to sit in close proximity to others, in other words, if you're a \respect the bubble\"""" type of person, you might want to rethink your choice. If you're with a large group you all need to purchase your tickets together so that you're seated together, or call the box office to see what they can do. The menu has been simplified, there's not much to choose from, but the food is decent  and  counts towards your 2 item requirement. If you're easily offended you can check out their Sideshow Cafe (I think that's what it's called) were the comedy is appropriate for all ages. Every time I go there's at least one person with a bitter beer face  and  I just assume they are generally unhappy people, because the show is good! This is a place for people watching  and  good comedy. As an added bonus, the staff is always very nice."""""""

<review>"""Its getting to be that time of year when you LOVE living in the Valley...because you can dine outside and enjoy the fabulous weather! Well, even though it was still a bit warm, me and my fiance and friend had dinner outside at NORTH on Saturday and had a good experience. First of all, I love the coolness of the inside restaurant...the chairs are white and the tables are set perfectly with big wine glasses. The look just exhudes a classy experience, without being to froo-froo. \nWe dined on appetizers of Roasted Artichokes and Zucca Chips...which were so good! Its easy to inhale an entire bowl of those chips, with extra salt!. For dinner, I chose to be daring and try the dish called \Not Your Traditional Chicken Lasagna\"""". It definitely was not typical at all. It was almost like a soup, but really tasty. They place a large egg noodle on the bottom of the bowl and then stack roasted chicken, mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, on top, then another eggnoodle and then big thin shaved pieces of parmesean and surround it in a broth. Its so good. Hard to explain it past that, but its yummy. We had to have wine with dinner, can't remember the name, but it was a Zin.\nI will say this...the special that night was a fish dish and I am glad we didnt dine inside. I would have been sick, because the kitchen is open and the smell just permeated the inside area. Choose to sit outside anyway and enjoy the great fall weather if you are in Glendale!"""""""

<review>"""Some might walk into Freddy's and think.. \Hey this is like Culvers..\""""   Sure, they both sell burgers and custard, but I tell ya what..  Freddy's burgers are far tastier and the custard is out of this world.  How's that for an 80s commercial?\n\nI got a bacon cheeseburger with fries.  I had no idea their fries were shoestring, but I loved them even more.  You can get carried away with fries and end up stuffing yourself.  These work just right.  I added some of their special seasoning on top and went to town. \n\nOnly bad thing was when I have a good burger, I can usually inhale the thing in about a minute.. the burger was gone in about 90 seconds.  Sorry! it was good!!   My girlfriend leaned over and said to me after I ate it.. \""""really??\""""  I know..  Sue me. It was good.\n\nIf I had to compare it to anything, id say Smashburger.  Which I also love.  \n\nFor dessert I had a great medley of custard, caramel, chocolate and pecans.. MMmmm.. super good."""""""
</review>
<review>"""This little place does a great job pumping out fresh Chinese food. It won't really blow you through the wall into the Avis rental office next door, but it's above average. Thus far we've tried several of the chicken and veggie dishes--they are all very good. The Garlic chicken and Mongolian chicken are favorites. Pei Wok makes everything fresh to order. There are a few clean, small tables you could sit at to eat (I think two two-tops and one four-top), but I always get it to go.\n\nThere are smaller lunch combos for a very cheap prices--cheaper even than going to Panda Express which is relative garbage. For dinner, you can get a \Large\"""" which is just white rice and entree, or you can get the \""""Combo\"""" which is fried rice, entree, egg roll, and cream cheese wontons. Look, maybe a better semantic strategy was in order, but they do what they can.\n\nThe guys running the joint are also very nice and friendly. They always banter with me about my tattoos, the weather, or anything else that comes up."""""""
</review>
<review>Been here twice now and i have to say this i a pretty good burger but the smashfries are the true star. The first time I went i got a made to order burger adding lettuce, tomato, grilled onion, cheddar, smash sauce, pickle and bacon on a 1/3 pound burger and traditional bun. This was a good juicy burger with the bacon being pretty tasty. It was also pretty filling for it's size.\n\nThe next time i got the arizona burger which is a 1/3 pound burger, peper jack cheese(?), chipotle mayo, guacamole, lettuce, onion, jalepeno, and some spicy bun the type escapes me. The flavors worked well together and i was impressed that while a spicy flavor came through so did each individual element. Even with the jalepenos there wasn't a really fire or burn to overpower the burger but a nice heat. It was a good specialty burger but i would prefer grilled onions on it.\n\nThe thing that will keep me coming back however is that smashfries which are great and the rosemary and garlic taste is just a perfect balance. No ketchup needed here the flavors are enough themselves. I have had the fries at 5 Guys, Delux, Joe's farm grill and these may be my favorite.\n\nAlso a nice touch with the close location to ASU is that they do except sun dollars. For a price that falls between McDonalds and more gourmet burger places this is a winner for flavor and value. With other choices like Chuckbox, 5 Guys, Whataburger, and 4 Peaks in the area this still is the best.

<review>My parents are in from out of town and after we trekked our way up and back Pinnacle Peak, we decided to reward ourselves with burgers.  Having taken them to Indulge Burger the last time they were here, Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers had something to live up to.  \n\nThey definitely came through for us.  We had the grilled asparagus appetizer along with the soft pretzel (what?  We just got done hiking and you can eat anything after you work out, FYI)  and both were VERY good.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  The pretzel was soft, hot and salted well, but not too much.  \n\nI had the Juicy Lucy burger, which was medium rare just like I requested.  Melty cheese in the middle with a side of tots (they even offer tot-chos, the decadant tater tot/nachos which was one thing we actually didnt try), it was amazing.  My mom had a veggie burger which had great flavor, and the sweet tots which are sweet potato tots, which I had never had and were quite good.  My dad's burger was also cooked to his liking, with lots of luscious onion rings on the side.  \n\nThey have a selection of hot dogs also, and a build your own macaroni and cheese option also.  YUM.  There was also something about homemade chips with buffalo sauce and blue cheese that I'll try after my next mountain.  \n\nStaff was friendly and prompt.  Great bottled beer selection including my favorite: Bell's Two Hearted Ale and of course, Sierra Nevada.
</review>
<review>Okay, wow! I'm not sure what happened up there... :0/  I WILL agree that the location isn't spectacular...and the decor is a little outdated, but all in all, we had a good experience. ALL of the employees were nice and accommodating. There was no big, scary security guard (I went on a Tuesday night...and YES, there was league play), and the food lady was quick about bringing our food out to us. Starting right when we walked in, the guy working the counter was quick to tell us about the different specials going, and even set up a bowling ramp, provided lighter kid's bowling balls, AND put up the bumpers for my 5 year-old without me having to ask. The place is pretty big, with AT LEAST 34 lanes (we were 33 and there was at least one more to our right), the snack bar, an adult bar, and an arcade with pool tables. Definitely worth checking out if you want to have a fun day/night out with your friends or family.\n\n\nP.s. GREAT SPECIALS EVERYDAY!! (some better than others)
</review>
<review>CON: (1) Small but your little one can probably spend a couple of hours here (2) No place to have lunch but there is a vending machine area.\n\nPRO: Our 17 mo old LOVED it.  Great place to roam and set her free.  We still followed her around though.  The play area to the right is specifically meant for 4 (or 5?) and younger but there were definitely older kids there.  I guess it wasn't too big of a deal b'c the place wasn't packed but I can imagine what a zoo it would be when it is busy.  THese places always make me feel icky 'cuz all I think of is how germ-y everything is but they do have hand sanitizers.  Not enough but they were around.\n\nWish we had something like this in the far west valley ... definitely something to take the little one to so she can exert some energy!
</review>
<review>I am really, really loving this new restaurant and must admit I am kinda addicted.  That being said, this review is probably a little altered.  \n\nHonestly, I am not sure what I love the most. I have been there three times now, from a weekday to a Happy Hour and I haven't had any issue with parking.  The wait for a seat was minimal, and the patio was inviting as the bar was fun, and the tables are sooo cozy.  \n\nThe cocktails are GREAT. I am addicted to the one with Ginger, but I can't remember the name of it.  I love the wine being on tap, it's eco-delicious.  I enjoy the company of everyone at the restaurant and I seem to see people I know there most often. The bartenders are a delight, they introduce themselves and talk a lot about the menu and choices, etc.  Even the owner/manager person (whoever she was) came by and asked what we thought of the meals, drinks, atmosphere, etc.  \n\nI also love the wall of tapes, and watching families bike in and get ice cream and sit in the floral decor of the comfortable patio with cute kids...very inviting. I could see bringing a date here (alas I am married now, so my date is my hubby), but I would also bring my parents and my son here.  \n\nI loved the Halibut, the Kale Salad, the snacks, the Sausage Sandwich and I can't wait to go again and try more.  With the closing of Bomberos/Verde/My Florist, the burning of Richardsons,  the crowds at Postino, the valet only at the Vig, the lack of fresh salads at the Garage, cold (warm) food at Local Breeze and the disappointing service at Arrogant Butcher - this place moved quickly up to a top choice for dinner and drinks.  Move over Hula's, SENS, Hanny's, TMI, Rokerij and CIBO! :-)

<review>Went for take out tonight with tha family. Wanted to try Vincents ever since I found out that they make a Sicilian pie. Grew up on them back in NY and have had very few that compared, that is until tonight. Ordered the Sicilian Special and we were very happy. Very close to the memories of long ago. The sausage calzone was also excellent, loaded with sausage and ricotta. We tried the Garlic Knots , but they were just average.\n\nVincents uses Grande Cheese widely considered the best available. They are obviously concerned about quality and it shows in their finished product. We will be back.

<review>Let's talk about your last date. Was it dry? Too revealing? Sultry? Do you even remember it? \n\nIf you're anything like me, it was sweet. Really, really sweet. And yesterday no less!\n\nBut they all blend together. Those dates...\n\nIN MY BLENDER! \n\nDates are nature's fuel. Chalk full of glucose, which is broken down with supreme ease by that tawdry liver you abuse with your binge, fringe weekends into the very usable glycogen. A solid glycogen supply is necessary... NO! Imperative, for sustained energy. You know, for your dates? Or the end of your dates, if you know what I mean, wink, wink, hubba, hubba... \n\nYikes. I'm that guy. \n\nAnyway, dates have become a huge component of my diet recently and I was reminded by Mama G. that the Sphinx Date Ranch is just a grenade's throw away from her house in Old Town. \n\nI stopped in to check it out yesterday and bought a 1lb bag of their jumbo varietal. Yep, I stole a wine word. From what I could discern, there are three date sizes and they're all priced accordingly, with jumbo being the most expensive. I bought those brilliant bastards, which don't taste any better but are more, well, shall we say jumbo(?) and moist and, I must say, simply amazing. If you're into this sort of thing, stop on by for shiz... They gots the goods...\n\nBut what if our date experiences came in sizes? Like you could buy a Jumbo blind date? He'd look like and act like this season's Bachelor or she'd have Mary's job and love of sports from There's Something about Mary fame. But if you're broke, you could just get the Medium Date with guys who are like me, only single. Dates should definitely be for sale. I'm starting a business. Done and done.\n\nI hear the milkshakes are not subliminally sublime. Just, like, regularly sublime.
</review>
<review>Love the food! We design and put together our own bowls so I guess we wouldn't be able to blame the staff if the food was bad, just ourselves, but no complaints here. Customer service is great, reasonable prices, excellent deals on domestic beers and if you get their loyalty card, you get even better deals. It's usually pretty slow when we go, but maybe because its during the week. I hope they stick around because its one of our new favs!

<review>I am so grateful that Giant Coffee is finally open. While I live just upstairs from two other local coffee shops, I'll gladly walk out of my way to go to Giant from now on. \n\nCoffee: I usually order a latte and it is always excellent, smooth and sweet and doesn't require any modification. \n\nFood: I've had an english muffin with jam, and I've tasted one of the pain du chocolat pastries they offer as well. Both superb.\n\nPrice: yeah... well, a little pricey, but in my opinion, worth the extra pennies. From the coffees (Four Barrel Coffee), to the organic milk from Strauss Creamery, and the pastries and breads from Tammy Coe and MJ (I think that's where I remember them telling me these were from)...totally worth it.\n\nSpace/Environment: LOVE the giant (pardon the pun) open front, the various options for seating, the free wi-fi, the music selection, and the fact that Matt and Erenia (the owners) regularly pop in and talk to their customers. \n\nThe not-so-great things (there are only two): The hours aren't great - YET. Tues/Sun 7AM to 3PM. But they say they'll be open 7am to 7pm starting 6/15. Nice! They only take cash right now. Hopefully they'll get with the program and start accepting debit/credit soon. I rarely carry cash with me and it sucks to have to stop at the ATM just so that I can go get a cup of coffee. Still, for Giant, I'll do it.

<review>Well, I cannot believe I have waited this long to give an update on Morgan!!  Especially since she is FANTASTIC!!  Yes, I have been back to her for the 5th time now and I love what she suggested I do to the color on my hair (much better than what I was doing) and her haircuts are the best.  She also has done some other treatments on my hair that have made it hold up under this hard, dry AZ weather.  And, she is so sweet and caring.  Oh, she has also gone out of her way to make an introduction to another of her clients (also from the South) who was new here and had not met many people and we really hit it off.  Morgan knew we would.  I mean what more can you ask for.........go for it...YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.   This from a HAPPY, HAPPY Client, Christine

<review>I work in this office building and I'm so glad because I probably wouldn't have discovered RF otherwise! We've been here for a few work dinners since we moved in, and everything is so good! The service is always great, and I'm never disappointed with what I get. My favorite appetizer is the kettle of green chile pork, which I could probably just finish off by myself. I've tried the roasted chicken and buttermilk-fried chicken on two occasions, and both are great. One is obviously better for you, but the fried chicken is a guilty pleasure I have no shame in ordering. They also have a great happy hour which is great to enjoy on the patio, but it fills up quickly, as they open at 4pm. I can't wait to get back here soon!

<review>"""Wow. If you like music, you will LOVE the MIM. This place is amazing! Perhaps I should say if you like music OR architecture, you will love the MIM. This is the kind of place that as you walk through, you mutter to yourself, \I can't believe I am in Phoenix!\"""" The MIM now is affiliated with the Smithsonian Museums, and after touring the facility, you will agree that is a perfect partnership.\n\nI don't want to repeat what has already been said on the great reviews, so instead I will just reiterate that you really need at LEAST three hours to see the MIM. That three hours will mean you have not seen everything, but it's a start. The MIM has a really nice cafe with limited hours, but has a coffee shop which is open throughout the day. In addition, there is a gorgeous music venue which you can take a peek at while on your adventure. It looks like a perfect place to catch a show, and much like the rest of the MIM, it is eye candy.\n\nThe staff at MIM are very knowledgeable and super friendly. The audio system you wear while on your musical quest is really outstanding. The sound was superior, and makes Bose look like dollar store speakers. Lastly, don't miss the gift store, there are tons of great items there, and I found my Mom a little Mother's day gift. DO NOT MISS seeing John Lenin's piano which he played Imagine on. It will give you goosebumps!\n\n Hope you enjoy your visit."""""""

<review>Best.Buffet.Ever.... I think those 3 words sum it up. Everything is delicious. I have never seen a selection of dessert so vast in my life. I come here with a game plan... start with cheese appetizers and end my meal with every dessert they have to offer. But my plan always fails. I can't start slow, this buffet is way too exciting. Totally worth the money and better than any buffet I've been to in Vegas. I'd come here every week if I was rich and had amazing metabolism.

<review>I've driven by this spot so many times on the 17 and finally decided to look it up on yelp.  Based on the mostly rave reviews my boyfriend and I decided to give it a shot.\n\nFirst off I was really excited about the mac n cheese since so many people said it was amazing.  I was severely disappointed and agree with another reviewer who said it tasted like velveeta.  I'm convinced that's exactly what it was.  The beans tasted like watered down canned baked beans.  Okay, now that the bad is out of the way let me tell you about the good.\n\nWe ordered the Q rolls as recommended and we weren't disappointed.  Both sauces were tasty.  We couldn't decide on what to get so we went with hog heaven to try a bit of everything.  We chose the St. Louis ribs, the beef ribs, brisket, and pulled pork.  Our sides were mac n cheese, beans, and roasted corn.  We had to ask for cornbread.\n\nThe cornbread was good, on the caky side but still good.  The roasted corn was very good, I recommend it.  The brisket and pulled pork were definitely up to par.  I grew up on both.  They weren't quite my dad's, but still worthy of recommendation.  Both ribs were fall off the bone.  I hadn't has St. Louis ribs before and I wont get them again.  They were on the spicy side, which I personally don't prefer.  The beef ribs were very tasty and I would order them again.\n\nAfter waiting for some boxes we started to look around at the other tables.  The baked potatoes look awesome, stuffed to the hilt of goodness.  They also had vegetables.  No mac n cheese or beans in sight.  We'll definitely follow suit next time.\n\nAll in all we were pleased with the experience.  The main food was done right and the restaurant and atmosphere was great.  The service was definitely to our liking.  The 10% off from yelp was also a bonus :)\n\nWe are both huge fans of honey bears and their sauce, although as of late the ribs haven't been fall off the bone.  We are considering buying honey bears' sauce and getting Bobby Q's beef ribs to go without the sauce.

<review>Scottsdale has some pretty standard restaurants I could find back in CA: Mastro's, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Wildfish, etc.  Bandera was a safe choice for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had a slightly different menu than the one I go to in Corona del Mar.\n\nWe started off with the grilled artichokes with a garlic aoli sauce, deviled eggs, and, of course, the infamous cornbread.  The grilled artichokes were standard fare, simply grilled and seasoned but tasty nonetheless.  The deviled eggs were ok, there were parts of the yolk that hadn't cooked fully through and were slightly congealed.  Also, the filling was a bit too acidic for my tastes.  The cornbread, however, was perfection.  A heaping, crumbly carb filled with corn, queso, and jalepeno.  Yum.  I almost finished the whole pan, that's how yummalicious it was.  If you go here, you must, must, must order the cornbread.  \n\nFor dinner, I had the grilled loup de mer with a side of tabbouleh and mac n cheese.  The loup de mer was grilled perfectly, was very tasty. The tabbouleh was good, not too lemony and the parsley was in perfect balance.  The mac n cheese is my absolute fave here at Bandera.  The shells are perfectly al dente, the cheese isn't too cheesy, and they top it off with panko bread crumbs.  Ahhh, a dish after my heart.  This is a must have, IMO.  My friend had the ribs and they were super yummy, but I'm not really a ribs kinda gal.  If you dig ribs though, they were falling off the bone, no knife needed. \n\nAll in all, it was a pretty good dining experience.  Next time I'm in Scottsdale though, I'll try something a little more adventurous.

<review>Phoenix continues to flex its muscle as a haven for Pizza.  This long time favorite provides a great comfortable, unpretentious atmosphere...surprising since it is in the middle of a Tempe industrial park.  The thin crust tastes like it has a dash of honey, the sauce is a great complement.  And that spaghetti calzone...let's just say that I wouldn't be surprised if other smart pizza joints don't start making it.\n\nLike everything else, there is more than one way to enjoy pizza. This isn't your typical wood fired Neapolitan, coal fired New York, or Chicago deep dish.  It is somewhat unique, it is very memorable, and it is should have a comfortable home within your pizza shortlist.

<review>"""I really dig this place!  The only problem with the U.S. Egg is that it is too far from my house.  I love that their pancakes are whole wheat!  I can find no other breakfast places that are \fiber-friendly\""""  with their 'cake stacks.  If I wanted a stack of average white pancakes I would save some money and Bisquick!

<review>"""I feel obligated to give this place four stars simply for competing against the Starbucks within the same shopping center.  Don't ever give up, Gold Bar!  \n\nThat being said, the prices and the not-great seating situation keep Gold Bar from earning a solid five stars in my book.  I know they have to make money somehow, but $3.00 for a \short\"""" latte?  Substitute soy milk and add tax, and I'm up to almost $4 for a pretty basic beverage.  The flavor and overall quality are definitely there; it just seems a bit over-priced.\n\nFor those wanting to stay and sip/chat/kill time, there are a couple of tiny tables in the front area, a small back room with limited seating, and some plastic chairs outside on the sidewalk overlooking the parking lot.\n\nBottom line: get your beverage to go, and be sure to use a Gold Bar punch card -- buy 9 drinks and get your next one (your choice) for $1."""""""

<review>I Love Filly-B's! The food is great! It is cheap! Open 24 hours! you can't ask for more! The food is be horrible to my heath!

<review>OK, so hubby and I have been here at least 5 times and we've loved it every time. My favorite thing here? ELOTE!!! Corn on the cob. This is not your average corn. It's grilled - it's covered in Mexican cheese, probably some mayo, butter and spices. It's amazing, and totally worth the $5 it costs. I'm not kidding. I even ran home this last week and made hubby try to replicate the recipe on the grill. Oh, and the salad - Ensalada Cortada is really, really good. The tacos are fun and come out individually. Anyway, I would recommend this place to anyone wanting a unique food experience and interesting decor (apparently the men's urinal is something to talk about!).

<review>"""I just got a blow job....and it rocked. \nYes. That's what I just said.\n\nI'm in marketing and a lover of all things branded well. If I were a boutique shop - I'd want to be the drybar. Amazing on all levels...this place is cute down to the little matchboxes which hold ponies and the custom lamp made of blowdryers and edison bulbs. The graphic design, web design, colors, interior - everything was comfortable and perfect. They even have little iphone docking stations by each \station\""""...serve mimosas (hello!)...and I could glance up and read subtitles on girly movies while also reading Cosmo. Doesn't get more fancy than that.\n\nNot to mention, I felt safe that they weren't going to fry my EXTREMELY thick and VERY curly hair because they obviously know what they're doing. Come on...it's what they do...ALL...DAY....LONG.\n\nHowever, it's like a trendy NY restaurant. The place is hoppin' - it felt almost impossible to get in. Called first thing on a Saturday for an appointment (the phone number is a appointment booking number not the actual store) but they gave me the tip to call back every 30 minutes and somehow I called and the 4th time miraculously got an appointment without having to bribe the hostess.\n\nCan't wait to rock my look for a very special girls night out tonight. As a backup, I attempted to make an appointment at another claimed \""""drybar\"""" place in Arcadia and it was a horrid experience just trying to make an appointment. I can only imagine what my blowout would have looked like.\n\nI bought a package of 6 - so I'll definitely be back for 5 more when I need to switch up the curly hair for some sleek sophistication."""""""

<review>a creme brulee truck? only in my wildest dreams! sometime in between january and now i dropped out of reality every tuesday and enjoy a cup of the most delicious creme brulee in phoenix when i visit Urban Beans for a coffee.  the sea salt and caramel is to die for and pairs perfectly with a cup of drip coffee from the UB. every week they rotate the flavors - i've tried lavender, cappucino, peanut butter, vanilla, nutella, but the sea salt one is by far my favorite. must check out this guy and his traveling truck for a sweet snack when you can!
</review>
<review>Grab your rich boyfriend and make him take you to Capital Grille.  \n\nThe food is FANTASTIC...I had filet mignon and believe it or not the mac and cheese side is to DIE for.  The wine selection is incredibly extensive but our waiter knew exactly what would go well with our dinners.  Dessert was a must too here, we had creme brulee and some raspberry thing that almost sent me into extacsy.  As other reviews have stated, CP is pricey, but hey, you get what you pay for.  \n\nParking is easy, located at the Biltmore they have valet but its not usually entirely necessary.  \n\nService was prompt and polite and everyone is extremely buttoned-up.  A great place for celebrating a special occasion or just feeling fancy.
</review>
<review>I am a big fan of Cheba Hut- but I will preface this with the only sub I ever get is the AZ Homegrowwn chicken salad. Yes the decor is 100% stoner and they have red Kool-Aid in a dispenser. The restaurant itself is tiny which is a drawback and there seems to be a lack of decent AC in the place. The staff is super friendly (but that may be due to other substances besides the sandwiches).  The line at lunch snakes out the door so be prepared to wait or try to come during off hours. Otherwise enjoy the toasted sandwiches amde with a little extra TLC.
</review>
<review>I like Mustang. I don't dislike Mustang, but it's nothing special. It's smallish but convenient on 90th St. by the hospital. It's a great place for study and offers a nice environment. I always go here when I don't want to get stuck on Scottsdale Rd. traffic to get to Civic Center. But like Erin said, don't blow off the library for the Barnes  and  Noble. Sure, Barnes  and  Noble has coffee, but your local library is supported by YOUR tax dollars, take advantage of all it has to offer!

<review>"""After hearing someone say \Phoenix has a zoo?... Really?  Well it can't be that good if I haven't heard of it.\"""" I knew I had to write a review.  (And yes, I did actually hold back from running over and smacking and/or shaking the guy who said that. It was hard, but I had a review to write...)  \n\nWhat you need to know about the zoo.  \n - Wear comfortable shoes!  Like the rest of Phoenix, our zoo sprawls.\n - Wear sunscreen.  Most folks don't think about it, but I know lots of folks who have come away from there pink.\n - Try to avoid going in the midst of the summer.  Not only is it too hot for you, it might also be too hot for the animals and they'll be camped out in the back under some shade.  \n - The monkeys are awesome, as always, but they have a great area.\n - They have a really diverse group of animals in a diverse setting - from visiting the croc swamp to barren desert prairies.\n - The food isn't half bad!  We were surprised!\n - Zoo Lights!  Starting around Thanksgiving and going through January they light up much of the zoo with cool themed displays.  It's not the entire zoo, so less of a walk, but enough of one that it's worth the price of admission.\n - It's conveniently close to the Desert Botanical Gardens if you want to make your trip a 2-fer.\n - 2 Words - PETTING ZOO!  If you have kids - this is the place to go.  If you're bringing a date - SO the place to go."""""""

<review>"""\Tag's\"""" is now back to its original excellence! \n\nWow, this location was huge compared to the others and cute as ever, I've been coming to Tagliani's basically my entire life with my family. It's that perfect place you'd want to take a date to, withOUT breaking the bank.\n\n I've never been let down, although I love the food here I see what Alexander may be trying to get at, I've experienced a small fluctuation with the consistency between the locations this last year or so. So the inquisitive man i am, I started asking some questions about why things were different. The response i received was about a year and a half ago the owner was in a serious car accident and has been recovering slowly over this time. I asked recently how he was doing and hes starting to get back into things, and the quality is now to my knowledge is what it's always been. \n\nI always resort to the Chicken Parmesan and have always loved that dish, but if you want something unique to Tagliani's and you like spicy order the Chicken Dynamante has a sauce made out of pepperoncini's soo good, or the Spicy Rigatoni, both are awesome and must try. The ciabatta bread is excellent but if your a fan of foccacia you have to ask for it. Also 32 oz mugs of beer what else could you ask for. \n\nBy far one the best Italian joints on the west side!"""""""

<review>Had breakfast here this morning. Great menu, the tomato/feta/egg sandwich was tasty and the bread was excellent. Major points for recognizing that subpar bread can break a sandwich - nothing's more dismaying than getting a sandwich that could have been good but is ruined by terrible bread! Decaf was OK, a bit watery. Yes, yes, there are those of you who will TSK-TSK and tell me that's what I get for drinking decaf, but in the year 2011, believe it or not, strongly flavorful decaf can be had. Shocking, I know, but true.\n\nThe downsides: a small seating area, and way too many tables in that area. Making my way to a table felt like hiking in a slot canyon. And it is noisy. I'd really wanted a relaxing, slow paced breakfast but this isn't the place for that.\n\nI'll be back, probably to pick up a loaf of bread or get take out. The decaf.... nope, won't be having that again.

<review>This is a great new addition to the Arcadia neighborhood; a nice little spot that's just a plain bar without all of the douchebaggery of the Vig, but doesn't exude the melancholy sadness of professional alcoholism like Darwin's or its predecessor, The Great Escape. Between the whiskey flights and constantly rotating taps, there's always something interesting to try, or you could always stick with the The Codger: a shot of Old Grand-Dad and a can of Old Style for five bucks.

<review>"""suuuuuper cheap good eats. they'd stay open late for our fellowship group on Friday nights.

It's fun because the menu also offers a bit of a variety of different asian cuisines. \n\ni recommend the beef stew curry. mostly because it comes in its own little mini wok, which is SO FREAKIN CUTE! oh yeah, it tastes good too."""""""
</review>
<review>WOW. DELISH!  I will absolutely be coming back here.  For their food, not for their service though.  The busser was horrible and we had to ask for things numerous times, but the food is worth it.  I had the garlic chicken, medium to very spicy, and it was unbelievably tasty!  I'm still full right now but if you put a plate of it in front of me, I would eat it all.\n\nWent for lunch, got there at 12pm and got a table right away.  Lunch prices are great - about $6-7 for the whole meal which includes soup  and  spring roll (both tasty).\n\nI will certainly be back, but maybe try for a less busy time (not peak lunch hours) in hopes of getting better service.
</review>
<review>Good place.  Knowledgeable staff.  Only complaint is they didn't have all the issues from the Wed. new comic day on Friday.  I keep reading about still having stuff on the shelf...but I wasn't able to get about 4 issues from the weeks releases.  That disappointed me a little.  The subscription plan as described to me...not the worst I've heard about in the area thus far...but not the best I've experienced (Acme Comics in Normal, IL had a better program and is becoming the watermark for how I judge a subscription program).  Good place, definitely worth a visit.

<review>"""Pool party sweeeet...great concept!\n\nI was here on a Saturday, maybe it wasn't \THE\"""" night because it was pretty empty. But I hear this place is great during the day and certain nights...guess I missed which nights. Love the pool concept and the drinks were inexpensive. I could see myself dancing the night away here...unfortunately nobody was dancing which I thought was odd...maybe thats a AZ thing. The music was great! \n\nCan't wait to go back on the right night...or day!!!"""""""
</review>
<review>"""OK...I've gotta give it up for G and S.  I finally tried it after I had heard from a few reliable sources that it was the place.  They were sure right.  But before you plan your Saturday night around the place I've gotta be clear that the atmosphere isnt going to blow you away when you walk in the door.  It sits in a strip mall between a pool supply store and a Blockbuster and there isnt any of that fancy new Zen asian stuff going on.  Well...at least not well done.  There are a few tacky fountains and some circa 1985 booths and chairs...but that's not what you're going to be going there for anyway.\n\nSo we sit down and and inquire about a Happy Hour.  I guess that they dont do that anymore.  OK.  So our first 5 minutes made us think that maybe we should have done Flo's instead despite the fact that we wanted to finally give this place a try.\n\nSo I ordered the Chef Special Noodles as well as the citrus chicken thinking that we've gotta go for the specialties if were going to give this place a one time shot.  Two minutes later our waitress tells me that they are out of the noodles so I am already doubting the recommendation.  So I ordered the beef noodles (chow fun) and sat back and waited.\n\n5 minutes later the food comes out.  That was when I figured out why I had heard such magnificent things about George and Sons.  Wow!  The food was amazing!  The portions were wonderful and despite the fact that it tasted so fantastic I still have leftovers for tomorrow (or maybe when I am done with this review tonight!).  Just wonderful!\n\nIt was so fresh and so unique in flavor.  You could tell that their \citrus sauce\"""" was the real deal.  It was created there by a cooking genius.  The chow fun was fantastic and although the service was simple...it was wonderful.  No attitude, no ego and very little trendy atmosphere.  Just awesome food in a low key environment.

<review>One thing I miss as an East Coast transplant is a good fish fry.  Went there today with Jacqui and Dave.  Service was quick and friendly, but not overly so.\nThe fish fry was perfect!  Not too much batter on the fish and it was perfectly crisp.  If you've ever had fried fish with so much batter that it doesn't all get cooked and you're left with soggy batter then you know what I'm talking about.\nRegular steak fries.  Great atmosphere.\nOH and they do comedy on Mondays.  I'll be performing Monday November 9th :}

<review>Great little restaurant.  The staff is super friendly, and their happy hour specials are pretty amazing.  I got thePanko crusted Tipalia which was a little dry, but my girlfriend's stuffed mahi mahi was delicious.  The Horchata bread pudding was really good too.  They have a nice patio where most of the customers sit, I will be bringing my dog with me next time.  \n\nIt is a bit expensive, so be prepared to drop some money, but it's definitely worth checking out.

Not too big, not too small, a nice crisp to them with just the right amount of sauce . . . the hot wings were just hot enough to get a sweat going without override the taste . . . the Pineapple Teriyaki, the Oriental Garlic, and BBQ Hot wings were very good too . . .  \n\nDamn you, Native New Yorker!\n\nThe servers have been great, Tony especially.  My $2 Coronas came at the right pace (yep, $2 Corona all day every day), he went out of his way to ask how each item was, and he gave me some great recommendations.  One was I asked how their Beef On Kummelweck sandwich was (it's marked as an NNY signature item), and he was indifferent to it.  He said he hadn't heard much good or bad about it one way or the other.  He then went say the Torpedo and the Steak Bacon Cheese are his favorites, and that he gets great feedback on them\n\nOk, he'd been great up to that point, so I gave the Steak Bacon Cheese a try, and it was very good.  I'd order that again but would ask for sauteed onions/mushrooms/peppers on it.  Add some giardenia, and that would be money in the bank\n\nThe atmosphere in the bar area is great, nice and dark, lots of brick, with tons of big flatscreens, and Tony was a vocal ambassador of the place.  He was great, and does service to the phrase \""""Trust your waiter\"""". \n\nMy only complaint so far is based on their take out catering.  Our office brought in the Penne Pasta.  It was Penne noodles, a reeeeeeally watery tomato \""""sauce\"""", barely there meat and barely there bits of dead green peppers and onions, with a congealed cheese topping.  To top it off, the whole thing was under baked, not a hint that it had ever been in an oven\n\nThere was still a ton of the pasta left over the next day . . . (I was at work, it was still free, I was hungry, what's a brotha supposed to do?) . . . and it was slightly better the next day because it'd gone from watery to gloopy after a good nuking.

<review>Dragon Palace has been my family's go-to Chinese food place since before I was born, so it will always have a special place in my heart. I think I had my birthday dinner here for at least 10 birthdays in a row. Nothing changes in Dragon Palace-- the menu, the decor, the workers all seem stuck in a time warp in the strip mall's corner. But that's what makes it awesome! I will always remember the teal walls and the red booths. \n\nOk, enough reminiscing. Food- you should get the hot bean curd. It's listed in the vegetarian section, which is a total lie because it involves a lot of pork. But man it is tasty, and spicy! Tofu magic! The mushu vegetable wraps with plum sauce are also delicious and a waiter will come to your table and make them for you, which is fun to watch. Also, the free tea is awesome! It just adds to the whole experience. \n\nDefinitely a long time Phoenix establishment, don't be fooled by the boring outside, go check it out!

<review>The best supermarket...end of story.  I like the covered parking, which helps in the dead of summer.  I haven't had need to use the car wash or valet parking service, but I think that it's a nice touch for people who cant walk far, mom's with kids and the elderly (or just super lazy).  The produce section has items I have never heard of and we have had fun trying new things.  The bakery has items that rival top tier bakeries, at half the price.  The meat department has a great presentation.  The service is great.  People watching isn't as good as Fashion Square, but it's not too shabby.

<review>I must begin by confessing... I am a Ross-junkie. It's a zen-like experience for me to wander the Ross aisles finding amazing deals on everything ranging from handbags to housewares to clothing to blank journals.  I have frequented almost every Ross in the greater Phoenix area and was THRILLED when they built one in my very own neighborhood.  (My husband was a little nervous for our bank account.)\n\nThis particular Ross has exceeded my Ross store expectations on more than one occasion.  It's WAY cleaner and well kept than any other. The staff is warm and friendly. There always appears to be an attentive manager present and I almost always witness employees cleaning and organizing sections while I shop (unheard of at other locations).  \n\nAs another yelper pointed out, the check-out staff take special care of any fragile items I purchase and when I've purchased more than my little hands can carry -- this happens often -- they have usually summoned carry out help before I even have to ask.\n\nMy Ross store -- a Sunnyslope treasure :)

<review>"""My 5 Series BMW recently came down with a bad case of \Twisted Seat\"""".  It was UGLY !  Not knowing what to do, I started researching car repair places and found that German Car Service had great reviews.  Well deserved!  Kenny and Mike were by far the most honest auto repair professionals I have ever encountered.  They stuck to their original estimate even though my driver seat was severely disfigured and it took longer than we had expected to get her normal look back.  Thank you so much for your help !   I HIGHLY recommend German Car Service.  Karen H."""""""

<review>"""Thank you to Check Please Arizona! \n\nI saw Daily Dose on Check Please and just had to give it a try. Wow...the bust kept secret in Downtown Scottsdale for sure. \n\nWe arrived for lunch and actually got one of the last tables available. We were greeted warmly and our server took our drink order quickly. The menu is amazing! If there is not something on there that makes you quiver, then you must not be alive. My dining partner (out on our every Thursday lunch date) ordered the Grilled Chicken Cobb sandwich. She had pause as it's served on a Pretzel Bun. Oh girl please....hit the treadmill more in the morning! She was \blown away\"""" loved, loved. loved her sandwich! I had the Turkey Burger. My felling is, if a restaurant is brave enough to put a Turkey Burger on their menu, they must know how to make it! They typically range from hockey pucks to bland indiscernible mystery substance. Not at the Daily Dose!!! Wow, Yumm, YAY!!!! is what my mouth was saying while devouring this burger! Such a great combination of flavors and yes, it's served on a pretzel bun as well...! The Combo Fries are the best. A combination of traditional russet potato fries and sweet potato fries. Such a great compliment to our sandwiches. \n\nI can HIGHLY recommend The Daily Dose Old Town Bar and Grill. It's good service, GREAT food and very reasonably priced. So when you are near Scottsdale for Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner, you owe it to yourself to head, no RUN to Daily Dose."""""""

<review>I was heading to Pei Wei when I saw this place and thought hummus sounded yummy. I ordered the veggie plate which came with hummus, tzatziki, falafal, spanakopita, dolmades and pita. This dish was gigantic. It could be shared by 3 people as an appetizer. I ate it for dinner though and took more than half of it home.\n\nTheir pita bread puts a known valley chain with pita in the name to shame. Seriously with a name like that, how can your pita bread taste like cardboard? Anyway, I digress... Cyprus Grill is amazing, and honestly why would you go anywhere else for delicious greek food?!

<review>Bison Witches (buy sandwiches,  GET IT???!!!) has been one of my favorites for years.  I first went to Bison Witches in Tucson.  When ever I go to Bison Witches I get the half soup half sandwich combo.  I usually order the Wisconsin Cheese Soup and the Beef and Brie Sandwich.  The soup is served in a delicious bread bowl.  I eat the soup and the bowl.  I know I am a little piggy.  The half sandwich is huge by the way.  Whole sandwiches are really huge.  Their sandwiches are excellent.  You also get a choice of Poor Brother Potato Chips with your combo.  The prices can't be beat.\n\nTheir bar is great and has great daily specials.  Try the Moose Drool, direct from Montana.  Its a good beer.\n\nI am glad Bison Witches opened in Tempe.  It saves me a two hundred mile drive to Tucson.  I would still make that drive to Tucson if Bison Witches hadn't opened in Tempe.  It is that good.

<review>Do all the cool kids hang out here? Yea they do! \n\nOnce again Carolina's has won my heart with her fantastic tortilla's, once you have one you will be disappointed with any other! Both locations I have visited offer stellar tortillas! Thanks for being consistent! \n\nI had my usual Machaca (shredded beef with onions, chilies  and  spices) Burrito with Papas (potatoes) :P You gotta try one the beef is tender and juicy but not sloppy wet. It is seasoned to perfection with just a mild heat. The potatoes just add another dimension of deliciousness!\n\nMy friend had the chicken burrito I tried it but did care for it. The chicken is a mix of white and dark meat and it was on the dry side. She put a ton of hot sauce on it. Also she said she thought it may be better mixed with beans and cheese. \n\nI will see you soon Carolina!

<review>"""Amazing. Perfect for a romantic dinner. Booked through Open Table and mentioned it was our anniversary; everyone who greeted us congratulated us. Asked us if we were interested in dining in the wine cellar room; quieter and more private. Beautiful there, but really cold -- they have blankets if you like. Meal was impeccable. Wife loved her heirloom tomato salad and halibut entree. My tortilla soup starter was perfect. The Three Little Pigs entree (barbecued loin, crisped pork belly, and braised [?] cheeks). Whimsical, fun, delicious and perfectly cooked. When I asked the server to sub something in for the polenta, he said, \Of course, what would you like\""""? Terrific wine list and beer menu. Service was right on point -- attentive, friendly, accommodating. Our Peaches  and  Cream Beignets dessert arrived with \""""Happy Anniversary written in chocolate on the bowl, and was comped. Literally nothing I would change about the meal or the experience. Well done!"""""""

<review>This is by far the best quality Mongolian joint I have visited in the greater phoenix area. It was clean with fresh ingredients and meat cut just right for preparation. It was about 9 dollars a heads with a drink which is fair for what you get in quality. They have handy wax paper to mash stuff in your bowl for those who really want a ton, and it seemed to come in handy for the people who wanted a LOT of food. The cook was fast and professional and the service was good, with a smile. I did not get sick eating here +1 star, there was no left out mess or ran down seating area +1 star, the soup was good, selection was wide, and soda machines worked properly +1 star, and last but not least - the oil / sauce combos were the best around by far with a nice guide to help you season your meal to perfection. I would have given it five stars but that's pretty impossible for buffet style joints. Check this place out for their cheap weekly lunch specials it doesn't disappoint.
</review>
<review>This place is a bit hard to find, as it's nestled in what appears to be a largely residential area.  It is, however, worth the effort to track it down.\n\nI dined with a couple of friends, and we all enjoyed the meal immensely.  We ordered 2 appetizers (garlic bruchetta and cheese curds), 1 small plate (flapjacks), and two sharing plates (chicken and waffles, and the nightly special, a fontina-stuffed beef and pork meatloaf served with scalloped potatoes and topped with a chunky, spicy tomato remoulade.)\n\nWithout exception, each dish was excellent. The cheese curds were so simple, without adornment, and simply fantastic. The bruchetta is definitely not for the garlic-averse (a strange trait I thankfully do not possess.) The flapjacks would be a wonderful choice for a vegetarian, and the hummus was divine.  The sharing plates were as delicious as you might imagine given the other reviewers comments, with the only note of improvement being the consistency of the waffle (too thin and crispy, but perhaps it was intended to be as such.)\n\nThe service was largely spot on and attentive without being annoying, the wine and beer list was sufficient, and the for the price, it's a steal.  For a total of 7 alcoholic drinks, 2 apps, 1 small plate, and 2 sharing plates, the total was $101. For the quality of the food presented, it was an absolute bargain.  I can't wait to return!

<review>I've only been to Verde once (SO FAR!), so take this with a grain of salt.  But on that visit, Verde impressed me.  A lot.\n\nIndoors is clean and decorated in a trendy, urban, utilitarian style. There was some audio equipment on shelves in a corner, and I wondered if they have a karaoke night or something.\n\nTheir menu isn't huge, but what they do, they seem to do well. The sauces were fresh and full of a ridiculous amount of flavor. I ordered the green chile, thinking it would be excellent, since the place is named after it.  So I shouldn't have been surprised that it was the best I've had in recent memory, but I was. Tender pork, fresh-tasting verde sauce with the right amount of spice. \n\nBut wait, there's more: even the rice and beans were fantastic. How many places put much thought or effort into a side of rice?\n\nMy friend had one of the taco dishes, and we noticed that the salsa that came with hers was completely different than the one that came with mine.  Both were fantastic.\n\nIf I have an experience on a future visit inferior to this one, I'll adjust my rating and edit my review ... but I don't see that happening. This is already one of my favorite downtown restaurants.
</review>
<review>Just do yourself a favor and go here and get the sliders, they are fantastic!!  I think the soft and chewy roll is what makes them so damn addictive!!  I have actually never tried anything else on the menu because all I know is that when I go here all I want is sliders!!  The decor of this place is really cool as well.  All stuff Chicago sports.  Although I'm not a fan of Chicago I understand this place.  If a place like this existed in Phoenix that had all things Boston I would love it!  I really don't have much more to say though about the place since I have only tried one thing but I will say this.  The staff is friendly and if the the Cubs ever win the World Series, it's free sliders!!

<review>Moved from Miami to Scottsdale recently. Every salon in the area I've checked out has quoted me for mani/pedi $80 +. In Miami everywhere you turn there is a nail location, although mainly they speak there native tongue and barely converse with you. I found Elite nails to be pretty impressive for a first timer. The women at the counter greeted me with a smile, took my name, thanked me for being early, asked  me to pick my color. By the time, I finished choosing my color my tech was ready for me. I was again greeted with a smile by Tiffany- a 20 something yr old that did a phenomenal job on my nails! Cuticles were cut perfect, although the calus rock scrape could have been a little longer I have to say I was definitely satisfied. She spent an hour and a half on both my hands and feet and we conversed like we had been friends for years. Did I mention, I was given my own set of nail clippers and tools from a sanitized closed packet?... No nail fungus, used tools that are not kept clean and/or sanitized properly. I'll be seeing them again soon.
</review>
<review>Their bread is awesome!! Its made fresh every night! You can actually drive by around 9pm and see them making the bread. They have different breads daily but have some daily. Unfortunately their hours are pretty short so definitely get in there. You can taste several of their breads everyday so the more you go in, you can taste test before buying the whole loaf. And when you buy 8 you get one free. Great deal! You can check out their website for all of the breads they have in detail daily.\n\nhttp://www.breadsmith.com/locations/mesamenu.pdf

<review>I have been going to Champs Salon now for 10 years.  It's amazing how time flies.  Originally I started going to Champs to have my nails done (by Mandy Evans).  She came highly recommended; and is a lot of fun.  Within the year; I also started having my hair professional colored and cut (by JT; also excellent). \n\nNow a days our whole family has some kind of service there; whether it be cuts or hair shaves for the men or color and nails for the girls. Both Mandy and JT have done so much work for us, onsite and off.  For my daugthers wedding, JT came to the hotel and did everyones hair for them.  For MY wedding; JT trained Mandy and my daughter how to style it (wedding was a in Rocky Point).  Mandy then came down and styled my hair and my flowergirls; along with generally assisting with everything. \n\nOver the past 10 years we have gotten to know everyone at Champs.  Most of the girls here have been here for longer then this even.  They are very professional, and concientious.  They stay up to date with new processes and products. \n\nThe worse I can say is that it is sometimes hard to get a last minute appointment because Mandy and JT are so busy; but I find that it works better to schedule in advance and not spur of the moment. \n\nAll their work is excellent AND guaranteed satisfaction!
</review>
<review>LOVE THIS PLACE! I was introduced to them because of a Yelp event held there recently but I loved it. The patio front and side are awesome. Now that the weather is getting a little cooler here - I can't wait to go there and participate in one of my all-time favorite pastimes ... drinks on the patio! It's a perfect venue. The parking garage is right across from the entrance. So easy! Oh, and the food was wonderful as well :)

<review>Some friends and I started going here a couple of months ago after our old wine bar shut down. I've been very happy with this new place we are starting to call our new wine home. \n\nThe wine prices are good and they have a nice selection of beers as well if wine isn't your thing. The staff is friendly and service has always been good for us. They also have a wine club that is well worth the money. They offer a full calendar of events each month from wine tastings to live music. Just want something to munch on while sipping on some wine? They offer some nice cheese trays and chocolate trays too...if you want something more they will allow you to bring in your own food (as long as it's not what they sell there). \n\nI'm happy we found this place and have started making a weekly trip here.
</review>
<review>I hate to admit this, but I liked PF Chang's.  Before you go and lose all respect for me, keep in mind, this is coming from a vegetarian's perspective, whose choices at most chain restaurants are a salad with iceberg lettuce drenched in dressing with more calories than super sized fries at Mickey D's, and a minestrone soup that may or may not be made with beef broth.  PF Chang's at least, 1. recognizes vegetarians by offering a decent variety of veggie dishes, 2. labels them well, and most importantly, 3. tastes good. \n\nWe were able to sample the majority of the veggie menu.  The chow fun was the weakest dish on the table--your standard noodles--but the lettuce wraps, coconut curry, and stir fried eggplant were all delicious.  They also offer brown rice, which is a huge plus.  My only gripes were that the seating was cramped, and there was a bit of a wait for a table.  Other than that, the prices are affordable, and the service was prompt and helpful.   \n\nI'm all for the mom-and-pop businesses, but for what it is--a chain serving Americanized Chinese food--as a last resort, and as a vegetarian, or just someone who's conscious of their diet, you sure could do a hell of a lot worse.

<review>Fred, Ethel, Lucyyyyyyyyyyy! I like-a dis place! I have been here 4 times..can't believe I haven't yelped it yet..but I have been taking a writing hiatis because my 4000 texts and 2800 talk minutes seem to be eating up all my time. Speaking of eating up...you've got to come eat up the grilled asparagus with melted Parmesan and balsamic drizzle...frizzle de dizzle..me good!! I have to get it every time! The bartender is awesome here!! The drinks are divine, the peeps hanging around to take care of your every whim...who could ask for anything more? Oh wait..I can! And they delivered..free valet outside the south entrance with an outside elevator just for Fred's! Oh no they di-'nt? Oh ya..they did! And on top of all that, Tony down in the shoe department has no problem pouring you a glass of vino and putting dessert on your feet! Yes I did, and it was well worth it! Love you Fred!

<review>1 Dollar hot dogs and 1 dollar soda and beer?! \n\nYippee!\n\nWe went to watch the sharks game and yes i love the sharks because i am from San Jose.  Duh!  I am slightly disappointed I did not try any food the buffalo wraps apparently didn't have much buffalo sauce and tasted like little dribbles of the red hot sauce so I in no way wanted to eat a nasty wrap that lacked the kick it desperately needed.  How many times do you here that about buffalo wings? Not many.  The dollar hot dogs didn't look the best but you can tell why they are or were a dollar.  \n\nIf I could bring my own food and desserts and drinks Id be in my own kind of heaven.  But then again you can go to a restaurant out side of the arena get completely full and slightly tipsy so you can really enjoy the game! That's be a Stellar time!\nWhy pay more for mediocre food when you have restaurants outside of the entrance?

<review>Beautiful Justine, the owner, seems to always there in a slinky dress and 4'' high heals (Ole).  She makes you feel like you have known before you've ever met.  She is a friendly host and smiling all the time.  \n\nMy two favorite things are: \n - the long beans and \n - the beef salad.  \n\nAlthough the food is vietnamese, it seems more exotic.  I never get Pho here, which is my standard at all other Vietnamese places.  I guess I am too focused on the items above to even ask about Pho.  \n\nYou can also bring your own bottle wine and open it at the restaurant for a small cork fee.

<review>I've been working in the Village at Hayden complex for over 4 years now, and my family has owned a business in the complex for over 15, so I've eaten at all the restaurants that have been in (and out) of the complex over the last decade and a half at least once, if not more. \n\nIt's owned by The Collins Family, proprietors of Wally's American Pub. The concept is really exciting to me. It's all about American favorites made with mostly local and always fresh ingredients of the highest quality. The decor is soothing, with excellent jazz-styled music for listening pleasure. The booths are large and comfortable, and the entrance for the patio is through garage-style doors. Unique, inviting, and pleasing to the eye. The other detail I noticed and loved was the weight of the flatwear. Maybe it's just me, but I really prefer eating a good meal with heavy and comfortable utensils. \n\nThe cuisine is what you're really concerned with, so I'll get to that now (finally!).  The only appetizer I've tried so far (because it's so amazing I can't stop ordering it!) is Dad's Grocery Bag. It comes with 3 cheeses (Manchego, Fresh Goat's Milk and Paremesean), 3 meats (Soppressata, Prosciutto and Capocollo), French loaf, olives, nuts and honey comb plated on a wooden cutting board, with the honey comb resting on a long-handled spoon. Now, if only my dad's grocery bag really carried all these delights when I was a little girl!\n\nI'm a salad girl, largely because of my grain allergy (I save my grain consumption for delights like the bread and a craft brew), and they knocked the Seasonal Vegetable Chop out of the park. Tomatoes, beets, grapes, squash, corn, tomatoes, cabbage, manchego cheese and butter beans tossed in a parsley creamy champagne vinaigrette. Excellently executed, and something I would eat every day for the rest of my many-remaining days if I could afford to do so. \n\nI've heard from a reliable source (my father, who is something of a fish nut) that the Blackened Red Fish was absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection, as was the dirty orzo. And the Grilled Angus Burger is a serious meat-eaters delight, with excellent ground chuck and fresh veggies with Tillamook Cheddar. \n\nOh. And their hot tea! It's LOOSE LEAF brought to you in a nice little teapot. If only every dining establishment would recognize that loose leaf is so vastly superior to the bagged teas. Maybe they'll catch on soon.\n\nFor a restaurant that has been open less than a month, I have to say that they've completely hit it out of the park. My new fav lunch spot, in a complex where the Spotted Donkey, Zipps, and Tandoori Times vie for that spot. The Collins Family has another hit.

<review>If you are from the Midwest...then this place is a little piece of home. The food is great and the service is impeccable. I have a Culver's in my hometown of Marquette, Michigan but can honestly say that I have never ever been there, due to the fact they came to town after I moved to AZ...but all my friends back home swear by it and as soon as this place opened up, my buddy here from Chicago swore by it up and down, he said that he was really happy that one opened up so close to him because he normally drives to the one location in Mesa at least once a month to get his fix so with all this raving I had to go try it out. \n\nI got the Mushroom n Swiss single with cheddar cheese fries and a strawberry smoothie...REAL CHEESE...OMG REAL CHEESE...amazing. To say the least the burger was good, the cheese chili fires are a heart attack in a tray and the smoothie was outstanding. \nI will say this about Culver's even though I enjoyed it thoroughly if you are on a diet this is not the place for you, almost everything on their menu has upwards of 600 calories or more...in fact I saw some things like their 4 piece fried chicken has over 2000 calories. So not a great place for dieters...it doesn't help either that they sell pints and quarts of their ice cream to go....by the way which is also delicious. \n\nWhat I felt was nice about this location is that you can sit inside and they open up the front of the store with these huge bay doors to out door seating which allowed for a cool night breeze to come in and you feel like you sitting outdoors indoors. Great big TV's with sports on...and a ton of staff to basically take care of your every need while you eat.\n\nCulver's is definitely worth the visit. The food is great and the service is untouchable for a fast food place. If you have never been I highly suggest going at least once to check it out.

<review>This is not very far from my home, but for some strange reason, I have never visited there.  Maybe because we don't have New York Deli's in Spokane, and I'm not familiar with the idea.\n\nThe other day, I agreed to meet my son and little granddaughter there for coffee and a bagel, and found that it is much more than just a bagel stop.  They actually have a restaurant with quite an extensive menu.  I had breakfast - the choices were very diverse - including skillets, various pancakes, bagels (of course), french toast, omelets, and a number of other items.  The servings were large, and the service very prompt and friendly.  Most importantly, the prices were more than reasonable.\n\nThe only thing that I disliked, was that they did not have hash browns.  They do have potatoes as an option with the meals, but you cannot actually classify them as hash browns.  They are good - but not quite a replacement for hash browns and gravy.\n\nI actually like it so much, that I stopped and had breakfast two days later on the way to the golf course.  Again, great breakfast at very reasonable prices.  Although I usually don't eat lunch, I am going to have to make an effort to stop in and try their lunch menu. And their deli counter, and all the different varieties of bagels.
</review>
<review>Had started going to Tomo when they had first opened.  Eventually weened ourselves away from the place because at the time it seemed that the service was not quite the same and we're real sticklers about that kind of thing.  Once we've had bad experience at a place usually don't go back.  Well we did decide to try Tomo again after the other place we found really began to suck and we are glad we did.\n\nService has been great and they seem to have a much larger selection to choose from.  Usually sit at the sushi bar, like to watch them making everything.  When you sit there you get this great little salad of lettuce, cucumber and julienned carrots with this flavorful dressing.  You also get a bowl of miso soup.  Then the rolls start coming and yum, yum, yum.\n\nIf you have room for dessert after getting your sushi fix on, you need to try one of the tempura ice creams.  It's a ball of ice cream, they have different flavors to choose from, coated with tempura batter, quickly deep fried, then presented on the plate quartered with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle.  What a way to spend the evening.
</review>
<review>As of late part of my Saturday morning ritual has been to stop off at Home Depot. I have a decent sized back yard that was just screaming for a few upgrades. \n\nMy first trip I was in search of a gas grill. The associate that was helping me was super enthusiastic! She totally got in to the hunt for the perfect grill. She was also kind enough to help me carry my treasure trove to the return counter for checkout, since I was parked on that end of the lot. The customer service was excellent. \n\nFor the past several weekends I've needed odds and ends for the container garden I've begun. The potting soil, plants and pots are all very reasonably priced. Another win for me is that the three plants I bought at Home Depot (cucumber, Thai chili and habenero) are alive and flourishing. Anyone that has ever bought a plant from a big box retailer will understand how nice this is. \n\nSo, great customer service coupled with excellent and reasonably priced selection? See ya next Saturday, Home Depot!

<review>Is there a way I can give LUSH an extra star???\n\nPros: Friendly  and  enthusiastic staff, incredible products, lots of samples, phenomenal smells, reasonable prices, and get this, an HONEST company!!! Read their bag, it'll make you love them more.\n\nCons: if you're sensitive to smells, brace yourself.  Also, if you're the type that wants to be left alone while you shop, beware.  The staff is excited about their products.\n\nDon't miss: R and B hair moisturizer (it drives men crazy!), Coalface facial cleanser  and  Brazen Honey exfoliating mask.

<review>Nello's is pretty darn wonderful - more than a strict sauce slicked pie joint in that some of their creations are pushing the culinary envelope.  I've actually Googled some of their specialty toppings at the table to figure out what they are, the cheeses so specific to regions around the world that you'll want to learn more on why they are notable.\n\nOriginal crust is thick and buttery, yielding heavy toppings and tender strands of mozzarella.  I'm a big fan of the Schriers pepperoni on a margherita pizza, laden with fresh garlic and torn basil.  Salads are hearty and plentiful, with a killer Spinach Salad (crisp bacon, egg, crunchy radishes and grape tomatoes) and White Balsamic Dressing.\n\nWaitstaff at this location are bustling while still managing to be endearing.  Service can get spotty on weekends when the place crowds a bit, but on two separate occasions where mistakes were made, the manager corrected both immediately with not only no charges for the items but still sending the ordered items.  We've actually left with two pizzas in hand - totally unasked for but very appreciated.\n\nI don't really compare the pizza here to other thin-crust pies - it's so specific of a taste, it's almost its own thing.  That all being said, it's such a yummy experience, if you don't pigeonhole the pizza, you are in for a treat.

<review>Another spot I love  and  can't stay from!!\nA foodie's absolute delight! Modern, but classic French, with an occasional twist.\n\nThis is another place that my husband and I  frequent regularly, order something new every time and love every time.\nI adamantly never ate pork until I relented and tried the fig  and  espresso pork belly at zinc last year.  And I have to say I've seen the other side!! Amen, hallelujah!!  Pork belly is absolutely as heavenly as people make it up to be...\n\nThe scallops  and  chorizo are amazing, short ribs, sword fish, crab crepes, omg!!  Just order and you'll do fine!

<review>Oh how I wished Walt's had better hours. With that being said though, that's the only thing sad about Walt's. \n\nIt's like your little friendly neighborhood hardware store. I've gone to grab paint swatches. I've gone to have keys made. I've gone to pick up caulk last minute. You name it, I've been able to grab it at Walt's and everyone is always sure where everything is when you aren't. It's almost like if you were to walk into a grocery store and hand someone your list and they walk you through in the most efficient way possible. It's that awesome. \n\nThrough Walt's I've learned that stud finders are in locked cabinets. I never would've known that :) Those studs... They're dangerous I tell you.
</review>
<review>This is where I go when I crave falafel, and that craving is not infrequent. The falafel platter is generous and filling and can satisfy even this carnivore who's trying to be vegetarian but relapses way too often. Their kabob platter is equally good and the shawarma is OK but could be better. Their tasty lentil soup makes a great beginning to any meal here.  The guys running the place are friendly and the dining area itself is pretty generic. Location is good, although it shares the same problem with the rest of the establishments in the area: parking.

<review>I LOVE French food.. in fact when we travel abroad, me and the Mr always make a point to visit a Frenchie place in another city. So when I got wind of a new French place right here in our own backyard I was stoked! The best part, its owned by chef James Porter, who did amazing job over at the now closed Tapino, so my excitement turned to elation when our reservation was confirmed!\n\nSo now that I'm home from my dinner with the Mr, I guess I'm slightly indifferent. While they had a strong opening night, it wasn't the service or food per-se but more like the other diners. \n\nThe dining room is small and extremely intimate with an amazing looking patio, we chose to sit on the inside. The interior is covered in wood, really, the floors, ceiling, walls but nicely contrasted by very stylish crystal chandeliers. I do have to say that I'm sure glad that they chose larger tables for the diners, since you can never have enough space. So there is plenty of room at the table to simply spread out and relax.\n\nService is pretty shiny and have no complaints, in fact our server was outgoing, attractive and knowledgeable. The bar staff was also very competent since both of our cocktails, Bohemian Sidecar ($9) and the Le Matador de Nimes ($9) were mixed perfectly and tasted great, putting us both into great moods until... a 6 top was sat down right next to us.. I know the old saying, you can't choose your family and in this case, you cant choose your dining neighbors either. They were so loud the Mr and I just looked at each other then decided to check email and stuff on our phones. We couldn't even talk which was a real bummer since this was going to be a romantic evening out. Anyway, the food will make up for it, right?\n\nOf course I have high expectations.. new Foodiebear rule of life, never have expectations of anyone, or anything or you're going to set yourself up for irritation, heartache and misery. With that being said they were out of f*cking Pate! Can you believe that?! Out of the one thing that Ive been looking forward to this entire week. Opening night, first thing on the menu, first table in the place, out of something. I know, I know, things happen but come on, this is opening night!!!! *Sigh* Ended up ordering the Steak Tartar ($8) and the Mr ordered the Foie Gras ($10). Both were excellent both in presentation, quality and taste. While my tartar wasn't pate, it was still excellent with its fried egg on top and crispy potato crisps. The foie was much like the tartar, deliciously perfect and for the price, major value. In fact all of the food that we ordered was really big, surprising for the price points. \n\nLet me tell you what, the Onion Soup ($6) was prefect. In fact Ive never had onion soup that was that good! Perfectly sweet, savory and the right amount of cheese crouton to compliment the soup, not over power it. The Mr liked his Vichyssoise ($6) with it smooth creamy texture and a quenelle of salmon mousse in the center which added a smokey complexity to the soup. Again, the servings were quite large and could have been halved pretty easily. \n\nEntrees were a kind of hit and miss. The Mr had the Steak Frites ($17) which was well cooked but came covered in compound butter thaqt had anchovy in it. First bite I was immediately turned off to the slight fishy undertone. Thank goodness neither of us have fish allergies, very unexpected. The frites were nicely crisp and well seasoned. However the side of sauce for dipping was just strange. Was made from vinegar and had a decent texture but just tasted odd with the fries and the meat all together. Would have preferred something a little more basic, again a preference. I ordered the Porc et Lardon ($16) as my entree and Im pretty happy with the result. Grilled bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with roasted pork gratin which was made with roast pork shoulder, shaved fennel and celery root. The contrast in the flavors and textures was right up my alley aside from the tenderloin being a tad over cooked, it is again opening night.\n\nDesserts were limited to three choices, Chocolate Brulee, Biegnets and Grande Marnier Souffle. We went with the Biegnets de Nutella ($6) and the Souffle ($6). The biegnets had a filling of Nutella which was alright but wasn't a fan until, I took some of the Mr's creme anglaise and dunked them into that. Delish. The souffle was so light and and was just brown enough to caramelize the sugar. You cant go wrong with either dessert. \n\nAll in all Petite Maison is an excellent value and with Chef James Porter at the helm expect solid French fare nightly with breakfast and lunch being added soon. Looking forward to back soon but this time Ill go with no expectations.

<review>Great place for a hike! Like other Yelpers have mentioned, this location is not crowded at all. We actually parked at the park at the end of 18th Street on the south side of the mountain. The trail from there joins the Lookout Mountain trail that loops the mountain. The other parking lot South of Greenway on the north side of the mountain was also pretty empty so you wouldn't have a problem finding parking there either. We chose to do the hike to the top of the mountain which was great but gets really steep at some areas so be prepared. The good thing is it's a short distance to the top. I really enjoyed hiking here because it wasn't too easy and wasn't too difficult. I plan on including this location in my regular hiking schedule.

<review>We love this place for breakfast, have not tried lunch items.  Multi-grain pancakes with caramel and banana are my faves, the kid likes the choc-chip ones and hubby gets the same bacon, cheese and mushroom omelette every time.  We all love the cheesy hash browns despite the coronary clogging side effects.  Another yelper mentioned the pancakes having too much cinnamon but I did not taste any cinnamon at all and I am not a fan of the popular spice so I would definitely notice an over kill.  The service is always friendly and accommodating, servers that laugh, talk, smile and deliver!  The place is clean, cool and brightly decorated. Not a full service place, you place your order at the counter yet the service does not end at the counter. The staff delivers your food, checks to see if you have everything you need and comes to clear your dishes.  They also frequently bus the beverage area keeping it clean and stocked.  Overall our experiences at Scramble have been excellent, it is now our go to place for breakfast.

<review>I had a great time! Can't wait to go back! \n\nYou need a reservation on busy nights, and you need to take cash to tip the complimentary vallet. This took us by surprise, but at least we didn't have to stress about parking. \n\nThe hostesses were very nice and efficient. We waited for our party at the outside bar which was very comfortable. Once it was dark they projected a movie/TV onto the wall which was cool.\n\nThe interior was lovely! Industrial lights and red brick walls. Beautiful paintings and cool architecture. I found myself inspired by the decor. The tables were really close together, but it was okay.\n\nThe service was great. They were on top of the water refills, so we were never thirsty. There may or may not have been an incident where the bus boy dripped olive oil on our friends one year old. This was just a speculation because we didn't see it happen. In any case she cleaned up easily and there was no harm done. The waiter was good at clearing away our plates and making sure we were happy.\n\nGood food! The French onion burger was way too good. I suspect someone exchanged their soul for the recipe. I got the pork chile verde, which was good, but probably not the best thing on the menu. \n\nI can't wait to go back again. It will be a good date night with my husband.

<review>"""My husband and I went to see \Act of Valor\"""", good movie go see it.  :-)  I'll always be a fan of Harkins, it's a local chain that is based in Phoenix and has locations in other states.  When we were at this location it appears to be in remodel phase which is a great sign.  The location is not in the mall but a stand alone so you don't have to worry that the mall doors are locked when you leave a late movie.  \n\nAlways love the staff at a Harkins theater."""""""

<review>this was across my workplace when i was in az. me and my co workers always ending up going to this place at least once a week because you just can't go wrong. my favorite is the jalapeno pizza which i always partner up with a side salad and an ice tea. finding a table can sometimes be a pain during lunchtime, but hey who can't blame them. this place is just that good. don't forget to get garlic knots on the side too if you feel like splurging on the calories, haha.

Go all out and don't look at the bill! This isn't a place for cheap-o's.  \n\nIf you are in a hurry, this also isn't the place for you.  Expect at least two hours here!\n\nIf you expect your food to be served cooked, you are in for a treat!

Then you order your salads, your main entree (if you bring a guy, order extra and LET HIM KNOW you cook your own food here). It can take a while, so order an appetizer or something because you can get hungry waiting.  The meets and veggies are cut skewer size so it cooks pretty fast.\n\nCheese Fondu: I suggest the Spinach Artichoke Cheese\nCooking Fondu: The Coq Au Vin\nDessert:- I'm biased because I get the same one everytime - Chocolate S'mores. I'd lick that damn fondu pot like licking is going outta style!\n\nOld timers: You know the drill - have you tried theBIg Night Out?  Its probably the best deal around.\n\nThe questionable:  The wait time in between courses and then waiting to eat my courses.  I guess that's the whole point. Savor, right?

<review>First visit  last night. Very happy to see something great go into the Clarendon. Cool to see that little burst of red popping out the front with the glass hinting at people and activity inside. There will be more visits!\n\n\nFOOD\nDig the simple menu. More places should try this: find a few things to make very well, and execute on them. Keep it simple. Add more only as you can do so without lessening the consistency and quality of your core menu.\n\nSo far, only had the tacos. They were fresh-tasting, well-seasoned and overall, delicious. A little on the sweet side, but the balance was there. Only critique is to echo that maybe the little metal radiators, while effective at display and containment of tacos, might be dissipating the heat of the food too quickly. Some other more insular, less conductive material might be a better (more expensive?) approach.\n\nDefinitely trying the tortas with egg next time.\n\nDRINK\nSmall, but interesting selection. Started with the Madre cocktail. Very fresh grapefruit/citrus flavor. No extra sweetener detected. Also, no vodka detected; but that could be my Irish liver or the power of fresh-squeezed juice. Next a glass of Lo Brujo - bright, minerally refreshing Spanish white. Enough citrus to balance out the mineral and the body.\n\nBoth beverages were excellent summer fare.\n\n\nUpdates to follow :-D

<review>Where Pinkie Danced.....\n\nIt's 10:30 P.M. on Friday, October 1.  We got an ice cream cone at Pink Spot, open  'til 10 P.M.  \n\nThose are important words in central Phoenix on Friday night.  Not only did we get ice cream, but I walked past people sitting out front at the cafe tables, sitting inside on the sofas, and sitting at the big table.  Friends, lovers, mates, maybe neighbors.  All talking, enjoying each other's company, the ambiance, and the treats.  A fine fall evening in central Phoenix.  The Pink Spot can't be mentioned without a word on it's tomato sauce and cheese slathered siamese twin, Z Pizza.  The Z was open, the lights bright, and if I wanted pizza, I could have some.  There's plenty of tables in the Z for overflow from the Pink.\n\nMost of central Phoenix shuts down after work, rolls up the sidewalks, driving home to Gilbert, Buckeye or Anthem.  It's a great thing to have a cozy, chatty evening spot with great ice cream and ice cream treats, and former Starbucks baristos steaming up all they bring to the coffee arts.  Pink Spot's a people magnet. \n\nDid I mention way-to-work breakfast meals, and again, coffee?  They open at 7 A.M.  Give yourself a little wait time and the Pink Spot will take care of your hunger and caffeine needs, sending you happily energized and your fast broken down the road of life.  \n\nPhoenix is trying to coax its central core into a more vibrant, attractive, alive-at-night city.   The Pink Spot is one of the places that's starting to happen.  About 9:50, the last trash bag hits the dumpster and by 10 you'll have to go somewhere else, like going home and Yelp*ing.  Maybe Pink Spot would consider staying open until 11 P.M. on Friday and Saturday nights - in the Fall, Winter and Spring.  Then  I might bring Sweet D by on a date.

<review>Great employees!!! Constantly offering amazing service with a smile and their perky small talks, it also offers an abundance of products, well stocked for your daily needs and demands.\n*** I frequent this Safeway so much, that they even recognize me by name!!! :) That's ALWAYS AWESOME, there is also a great lady very worthy of mentioning, by the name of SUSAN working at the Starbucks inside this location and she is ALWAYS SUPER FRIENDLY and bubbly!!! I adore her!!! No hit or miss with her!!! Always greets me by name with a genuine smile!!!\n*** Also, wonderful cashiers and meat departments employees!! Honestly everyone at this location is super nice, I always leave with a positive experience!!!

<review>I FINALLY made it here with some friends after months of wanting to try it out and it was worth the wait. This is a really cool place with a nice open feel, cozy and casual. There is also a nice bar. I was really impressed by everything that we had. They have a great deal after 8:00pm on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday that consists of a half-pitcher of wine and their noshing board for $25...GREAT value. We also had Brussels Sprouts and Chicken Meatballs both of which were great. The Chicken Meatballs are served with a spicy marinara that I swear has a touch of cumin that gives it a slight curry taste-DELICIOUS!!!\nFor my entree I had what is probably the BEST Shepherd's Pie I've ever had. The beef was so perfectly prepared that it was tender and delicious while the tips of the beef were so slightly crisped it really was blissful and euphoric to consume it. I was also able to try the short rib which was equally tender and flavorful as well as a damn good pork chop (which was their special) considering that I am not a fan of pork. This pork chop was tasty and moist, not dry the way pork chops can be. Their Macaroni and Cheese is good with little bits of bacon.\nFor dessert we had Death By Chocolate and Pumpkin Creme Brulee. the Creme Brulee tasted like silky pumpkin pie minus the crust. Death by Chocolate is a creamy chocolate pudding topped with whipped cream and a chocolate cookie.\nHearty is probably the best way I can describe my meal here and the entire evening was enjoyable. The service was attentive and enthusiastic-maybe a little too enthusiastic as I felt like I had ADD when the entrees with their amazing local ingredients were being described to me. But considering how awful service can be in some places, it is refreshing to see servers who have such passion and pride in the food they are serving. \nI highly recommend Beckett's Table for an outstanding meal, reasonable prices, good service and an overall great experience dinning out. I think I may go back next week.

<review>"""Not a little bit country, not a little bit rock  and  roll (Donnie and Marie, hollah!), and well, not at all quite corporate, Hotel Indigo has a sleek, hip vibe all around while being very comfortable and accessible to those of us who don't necessarily like staying at a larger chain hotel (Hotel Indigo is, however, part of the IHG, Intercontinental Hotel Group). \n\nA major reason why I'm so generous with my stars here is that the bathroom mirror makes you always look good. Can I get one in my house, please? I can't emphasis enough how your whole frame of mind changes when you look into a mirror and think, \damn, my skin looks great!\"""" whether that's at 3 in the morning or 7 in the evening (let's add on to that: wow, my eyes sparkle and do I detect a shimmer in my hair?) OK, so maybe there's some kind of hocus pocus going on in that mirror because I rarely, if ever give four stars to a hotel.\n\nRooms are well-appointed, the wood panel floors are nice and the bed, bedding and pillows made for a good night's sleep. It's also spacious enough, with a couch and coffee table area. \n\nI *loved* the outdoor patio that is off the bar. There's a fire going on out there, along with heating lamps. A real treat for those of us who hail from cities where cold winters are a source of our discontent. The bar itself is comfy and nice, only complaint being that the prices are that of what you'd expect in a New York City bar (8 bucks for a Three Olives cocktail? 8-10 bucks for a glass of average wine?). Oh and that pool! It glows in different colors at night. There was a night when I sat on the patio (which overlooks it) and it was just a really cool effect. I think that the deck is a major draw to staying here. And because it's the desert, no effin' mosquitoes, so you can sit out here all night if you want.\n\nStaff is accommodating and sweet, especially the gals who worked during the day in the bar/restaurant during the week and on Saturday. The bartenders during the week were really cool, too. Not sure why this bar closed at 11pm on a Thursday. Major bummer. I guess it's a slow time of year. I just wish they could be consistent, as the night before the bar closed at midnight (and when I asked the front desk how late the bar was open, I was told midnight). \n\nI'm a big fan of rain showers and the water pressure was decent (until someone flushed a toilet). The hard water stains by the drain were kind of icky to have to look at...someone needs to go at the grout with a toothbrush. Also curious why they have those cards out that say they are a green hotel, but my towels were changed daily (I hung them up as directed). I can see changing out the washcloths but it's a bit excessive to change out the towels. Also worth noting that no hotel seems to practice what they preach on those cards.\n\nOne drawback to the hotel is that the gym is TINY. As in, two treadmills, two elliptical machines (one of which wasn't working) and one bike. The weight room, also tiny, has a good amount of free weights. I was thankful that Hotel Indigo didn't seem to have any other business travelers because working out in the early morning would have been impossible.\n\nI am also not such a fan of the dreary meeting room on the fifth floor, either. What's up with that? I kept looking up at the black ceiling with exposed vents with despair, although I was hardly in a desperate situation. Not to mention, there's a lack of any natural light and ugh, I can't see anyone wanting to spend time in there, even when surrounded by the most entertaining and coolest colleagues (the Yelp CMs, of course).\n\nBath products are by Aveda (Rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner. Tiny bars of soap, which I'm not a fan of (shower gel, please!) and an unappealingly scented lotion. They are not generous with replenishing the products. This wouldn't be a big deal if this were not a hotel owned by the Intercontinental, but when the Westin and W replenish your products daily, you have to wonder why the Intercontinental is cutting corners in this way. If you're going to call something a \""""boutique\"""" hotel, then bring on the amenities. \n\nAs others mention, if you're sensitive to noise, you might not want to stay in this hotel (or in Scottsdale). The hotel kindly provides bedside ear plugs, however. \n\nNone of the above mentions are a deal breaker though, just worth noting. I'm a fan of this hotel and look forward to staying here again in the future. \n\nThen again, this could be just the mirror talking..."""""""

<review>Tiny little gem of a place. \n\nI hesitate to give it five stars given how few menu items I've actually had, but the ones I have had are bloody good. The pasta giovanni is absolutely freaking outstanding. Despite the large portion, every time I feel compelled to keep shoveling it down until the plate is clean. \n\nThe fried mozzarella appetizer is good too. I was expecting those stupid sticks that come as appetizers everywhere else. Instead, it was a nice, large piece of cheese that looked like it was covered with the batter from fish n' chips. \n\nI've yet to have the pizza, although walking by tables with it, it does look promising. Once I go an convince myself not to have the giovanni, I'll give it a shot.

<review>When I worked in the area, Jamaican Blue was my salvation.  \n\nI had the meanest, most evil boss ever and no break room to sit in during my lunch hour. So I'd often just come to Jamaican Blue to get out of cubicle hell and relax for a bit. \n\nThey have some pretty good coffee drinks and the place just has a cool vibe.  I've seen quite a few people in there working, reading a book or just hanging out.\n\nIt's a great alternative to Starbucks- check it out.

<review>"""I rolled into town (Carefree and Cave Creek) looking for an inexpensive hotel/motel.  All I could find was The Tumbleweed.  It looked like the Bates Motel (Psycho) and I couldn't even find the lobby; I wasn't sure if it was part of a store next door that sold saddles and wagon wheels (but it was locked up and closed).  I saw a sign on the ground with a hand painted on it and the finger pointing to the sidewalk.  It said \Lobby.\""""  I never found lobby.  That was my good luck because I gave up and asked a local if there were any other hotels around and he directed me to the Carefree Resort down the road about a mile or so away from bustling Cave Creek.  \n\nGot a room for $69 which was a great deal because the room was beautiful and had a big balcony with a view of gorgeous cacti.  The service was great except that housekeeping didn't clean the coffee pot; no big deal.  I'm just glad they had a coffe pot!  \n\nThe pool was fantastic and the burger (poolside) was yummy.  The bellman gave me a free ride into Cave Creek where I had a rip-roaring good time at the Buffalo Chip nearby (with real live bullriding in the back!).  The bellman even  agreed to come back and fetch me anytime!  Cheers to that!  The  resort is beautiful and I look forward to my next stay there!  Five stars!"""""""

<review>I was visiting from LA for Thanksgiving and rounded up my family to have a drink there before dinner.  Fortunately we got there early or i guess we wouldn't have gotten in.  I'm glad we did.  The bar/pool area is really cool and comfortable.  The servers were all really cute and helpful.  \n\nhave to say though, I was surprised at the overall design of the building.  Considering they built it from scratch, you'd think it could look better then a bland office building.

<review>"""The $20 bruschetta board and bottle of wine deal is too good to pass up even though I think the bruschetta here isn't that great. The bread is too chewy and I felt like I was fighting with it just to get a bite. Our waiter was fantastic. We got there a little before 8 and asked if it's too early to get the $20 deal and he said \I'll make it happen\"""". He was genuinely nice and gave us several different wines to taste. I'd rather go to Kazimierz but I will definitely come back here on a Monday or Tuesday to take advantage of the wine and bruschetta deal."""""""

<review>Since I had a lovely night here last night and have had several such nights, it must be time for me to yelp this place.\n\nI wouldn't say that I would go to Side Bar on any random night, but rather on a night where I felt like doing it up just a little bit.  I'm not a lounge bar girl, but rather a dive bar girl.  Either way, as far as lounge bars go, Side Bar is basically it.  This is the kind of bar you bring a boy that you're dating who lives in Tempe to show him that there are cool bars in Central PHX.  It seemed to work out well for me last night.\n\nThe crowd can be pretty hit or miss- I've seen some major characters in this place.  You just have to lay back and take it all in, I guess.  \n\nI'm always a bit irritated by the lack of draft beer, but Strongbow always seems to make me happy here.  The bartenders are hot, and they have mints in the bathroom.  I'm a fan.

<review>"""Pretty cool place!! Helpful employees, no pressure to buy anything. Which is nice when you are a parent of 3 kids. The store at Downtown Disney is a bit pushy and hands a lot of things over to kids. Which turns into survival of the fittest when you have a kid who wants a $100 Lego set. True story. \n\nIt was nice that the employee came over and told my son to \fill the bucket until it won't close. We tape the top on\"""". My son was was afraid he was stealing if he took too many. Or that they would weigh the container like a salad bar! Not true either way. Chase was happy with his full to the top $7.95 bucket of Legos. I was happy...

<review>I came here with my bro and his gf (when we visiting relatives in AZ) after they had tasted some of their brews at a beer fest in San Diego and I was not disappointed.  Some of their own brews: the orange blossom and coco joe are some of the most delicious and unique beers I have ever tasted.  I recommend bringing growlers home.  On top of that, some of their taps included Chimay, Delirium, several seasonal Belgium imports and other micro brews that are skipping my mind right now.  If you HAVE to be in Phoenix or Scottsdale, make the trip worthwhile and stop here.

<review>I am a sucker for James Beard Award places so this made my short-list this year for my trip.\n\nIt's in a cute heritage area just outside the mammoth convention centers and sport stadium, so parking is a bit of a pain.  Once you get inside, it's incredibly quaint.  There is a server/menu mismatch since I'm guessing there are not a lot of Asian people in the area.  So to hear the server (who looks like a student backpacker) describe an isakaya and items where there is some Chinese influence, it gave me a good laugh.\n\nThat being said, the food is excellent.  The portions are small so I'd recommend 3-4 dishes for 2 people.  We shared the curried lamb with mango (mmmm, so good!)  If there are any Vancouverites reading this, think Vij's lamb popsicles but marinaded in a different sauce.\n\nThe warm duck salad is excellent!  It's a neat twist to serve the salad warm and slightly seared and it paid off well.\n\nThe pork belly buns were delicious - I've never had these before!  They use the Chinese style steamed bun material but shape it into ovals that they fold in half and insert the pork belly filling.  Excellent!\n\nThe menu is small but very solid.  Service was OK and if this was more polished/authentic/better fitting to a higher-end Asian restaurant, I would bump this up to a 5.

<review>"""Three flights up from The Big Bang basement bar, The Library street level bar, and on the roof of Hooters is the icing on the college bar cake stack. Once you step inside and begin to catch your breath (assuming you're a sad old fuck like me and get at all winded from scaling three flights of stairs), you'll feel instantly at home (if home to you feels like a moderately nightclubby rooftop college bar on Mill Ave.). \n\nThe inside is all black, but they spared us from the excessive black lights that illuminate your fabric softener making you feel like everyone can see your body is covered in dandruff. There's a big open dance floor that spans the length of the room along the bar leading to an outside patio. The walls are lined with a college version of swanky white comfy seating with curtains to make you feel like a VIP. \n\nWe were allowed to sit in a velvet roped off VIP area, but told that we would only have to move if someone \bought it.\"""" We were soon to find out how unlikely that would be...\n\nThe Dj arrived and started blasting hip hop (a personal un-favorite), and I asked him to turn it down in just the speaker that was aimed at us so we could hear each other. It took us awhile to realize that nobody was inside even though we had a clear view of the patio, but we finally did and we headed out. \n\nThe patio was quieter and it overlooked Mill Ave in all its glory. We could see from the treetops to the pedestrians across the street. The patio quickly filled up while the inside remained more or less empty. They were gracious enough to include an outside bar so we didn't have to endure hip hop music on 11. There were also beds outside and some decent bar-height seating near the balcony which made it pretty casual and relaxing and social. \n\nMy biggest problem with the outside was that everyone was smoking (as young people all apparently do) and it felt just as smoky as the insides of smoky bars used to be before the smoking ban. I also kinda felt kinda cheated by having to pay 2 bucks for a diet soda refill (no refills, son). The staff was pretty nice and the waitresses seemed to be very attentive and efficient (and cute). \n\nIt's not really my kind of place because of the music and the crowd and the fact that those days are behind me, but I imagine that it has to be the best thing on that corner. If you're in your 20s, it seems like a great place to go."""""""

<review>A very good Hampton Inn.  Very pleasing color scheme, great location near shopping and restaurants.  Excellent work desk in my room with good WiFi and electric plug above the desk.  \n\nSince I travel a lot on business, Hampton Inn is my go to place.  Included breakfast and WiFi are generally very good.  Hampton Inns are usually about 70 to 90 rooms so access is quick and parking is close.  The price/value equation is usually very good.  Downside, all Hilton properties are withdrawing from Southwest Airlines traveler program as of 01/01/2012.

No, but it certainly is impressive. \n\nSome of my personal favorites so far:\n-fresh bread from the bakery\n-quite the cheese selection\n-sushi made on the spot (Chris loves it anyway)\n-their produce just looks pretty (and tastes fresh)\n-the neatness and organization of the store\n-the premade fresh meals (chicken and veggie kabobs made for me!)\n\nIt's not going to be a regular stop for me (a bit too far from my place and a bit too large), but it certainly seems to have it all. Good work Fry's people.

<review>"""I have been going to \college\"""" for 11 years now... yet I have no degree. I bet you are wondering how that is even possible.\n\nMaybe, like Van Wilder, I just like being in school (I don't, I hate it). \n\nMaybe I'm dumb.\n\nMaybe I'm desperately trying to prevent my youth from slipping away. \n\nAnyway, back to PVCC. Beautiful campus. Well maintained. Variety of classes at convenient times. Nice professors. Amazing cafe (get the cheesecrisp!!). Overall my fav community college in the valley (and I have been to all of them).\n\nGO PUMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"""""""
</review>
<review>I've been here a LOT. I live down the road. \n\nTo start...the food here is pretty much all good. The only thing I would suggest avoiding is the nachos. They load them up but so much the chips turn soggy real quick. However they have odd things like deep fried pickles which are delicious and their breakfast foods are super delicious.\n\nThe staff is wonderful and we are never left for wanting to say the least. Some of them actually recognize us by face which is nice. \n\nThe restaurant itself is really nice, some of the seats are a bit beat up but otherwise it's always really clean and they have mini juke boxes at each table and you get 2 songs for a quarter so bring your change! Unless you hate 50s music that is. It's also all 50 decor inside so if you're looking for a nostalgic place, this is the place to go.\n\nAs for the shakes, everyone is right in saying they are awesome and they're HUGE. I can almost never finish them. \n\nOver all, I'd highly suggest this place and also you can ask for the discount cards so if you get 7 meals, you get 1 free. It's not very pricey either which is a plus.

<review>Better than Pizzeria Bianco...NUF SAID!!! \n\nSeriously, this is one of my favorite places to dine in the valley, phoenix, arizona, um...anywhere for that matter. I've had some of the best pizza there is, from new york to chicago, italy and back. Cibo is my favorite. The service is always spot-on. The wine list smart, the appetizers tasty, salads luscious, deserts to die for, the location is adorable and of course the pizza is perfect! This place has palpable charm and the ambiance whether its quiet or busy is somehow always what you hoped for. Just writing this is making me change my plans for dinner tonight!

<review>I recently dined here with a friend and had a great experience! \n\nI love places that bring out bread right when you come in, so that was a great plus and a great start. We ordered one salad for both of us and they brought it out for us on separate plates already - so that was nice. \n\nI had the crusted trout and it was pretty good. I can't say it was divine, but I did enjoy it. The sauce that came with it was extremely good. \n\nI liked the service and how attentive the staff was. Although at one point I had 3 people ask me (within a matter of minutes) if they could take my plate...but I wasn't done with my food yet. That was kind of annoying...but no biggie. \n\nOk...are you ready for the best part? The best part is that they make all their ice-cream and desserts in-house! We order the Alaskan something (forgot official name) and the peanut butter/chocolate thing. OMG! I can come back here everyday and eat just the dessert. \n\nThe ice-cream that came inside the Alaskan thing was raspberry with chocolate chunks. The last time I had something similar was in Cincinnati, OH and I'm so excited to have found it in AZ. \n\nOverall great experience and we'll be back!
</review>
<review>I can't say enough great things about the Tuck Shop!  I have been there a handful of times and every time they are gracious and inviting.  A few of those occasions I have been with a group of people and we always get loud and rowdy.  But I never feel like we need to calm down.  The owner and servers always remember me which make me feel oh so special!  The menu changes quite frequently but my absolute favorites, cheese curds and the skirt steak are staples that never change.  I am actually heating up my left over tomato casserole right now!  If you go on the night where the special is fish and chips, do not hesitate, order them.  The best fish and chips I have ever had.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them...

<review>This place is just lovely - a true hidden gem.  I discovered Fuego Bistro after it was featured on Groupon, and I'm sure glad I did!  I have been there 3 times now, and each visit was just a great as the previous. \n\nI have been there on a date, I took my 50 year old mom there, and I also went with my mid-20s female friends to celebrate a birthday.  All different audiences, but everyone I have taken has loved it!  Needless to say, it appeals to many, and is perfect for birthdays, anniversaries and friendly get-togethers.\n\nEnvironment:  I have never sat inside because I very much enjoy the outside patio.  At night, it is very quaint and romantic with a water fountain, Christmas lights of sorts, nice trees and vines, and there has been pleasant live music during all 3 of my visits.  It is a quiet venue, making it very easy to converse with those at your table.\n\nService:  The Fuego Bistro staff is attentive, friendly and genuine.  It seems they have all worked there for some time and that the owner does a wonderful job of making them all feel as though they are a family.  They seem to know and care about each other, they believe in the place they work, and the customers benefit as a result.\n\nFood:  Delicious!  My absolute favorite dinner dish is the braised angus short rib roast, and I'm not even a beef person!  It is wonderfully marinated and very flavorful.  I have had all of sides from the mashed potatoes to the carrots, and all of them are great.  What I love about Fuego is that they take a classic dish and add its own flare with an array of spices and sauces.\n\nPrices:  The dinner dishes range in the mid to low $20s, but I have only visited Fuego with a Groupon or LivingSocial voucher in hand. I love that Fuego is so supportive of deals and the waiters/waitresses are not only accepting of the vouchers, but they are enthusiastic about your savings as well.\n\nI highly recommend you visit Fuego Bistro for a unique and pleasant dining experience!

<review>I'm not particular on Thai food, however, I was really impressed with the teriyaki chicken with fried rice and brocolli.  Usually, teriyaki has an overwhelming sauce, but I felt their sauce was absolutely perfect and meshed well with the fried rice.  Also, I highly recommend the curry chicken with pineapples.  I felt for the quality of the overall food/beverage, the price was affordable at 7-9 bucks.  If you don't want to dine it, you can always order for carry out.\n\nI'd go back.

<review>I have been coming here for over ten years on and off.  It is a typical independent burger joint with a theme (in this case Chicago).  The burgers are tasty with gently fried buns, sauce, tomato, onion, etc.  The hamburger meat is cooked medium well which blends with the fixings.  Overall the hamburgers are made just right.   The fries are delicious and tasty.\n\nThe parking can be tricky.  The parking lot surrounds half of the restaurant and is difficult to navigate.  It is too easy to get locked in to a space by another car.\nThe atmosphere has not changed in over ten year with the kitschy Chicago theme (newspaper clippings, photos, memorabilia, etc.) and will likely not change for another ten year.\n\nA nice treat for under $10.00.

<review>"""We go here at least once a month. It seems economical but I think I spend more money here than anywhere else. But I do use most things. Umm..Most.\n\nThis particular Costco is fairly new. Maybe opened around 2005. We just bought a memory foam mattress from here and they also had a coupon in their \coupons\"""" flyer for a $100 off. It was a great buy considering we would have paid twice what we spent here at a roomstore or ashley furniture for a simple mattress much less a memory foam mattress. The mattress fit fine in our 2007 camry in the backseat. It comes on rollers.\n\nWe love the little samples they give out but have rarely purchased what they are advertising, except for the Mango Nectar. Yumm...\n\nWe really like the Kirkland papertowels. I like them better than Bounty. Also their Hummus is awesome. They also have fresh Medjool dates for 6 months out of the year. More towards the warmer months of the year. They come from California and are much cheaper than most other places. I prefer not to get their fruit and veggies there because it is too much and it mostly goes bad before i get to it.  Word is that they import their lamb directly from Australia and it is halal.\n\nAlthough I have never returned anything yet at Costco, I do like their return policy. They do take \""""anything\"""" back. I have seen people returning watermelons e.t.c before. \n\nI prefer Costco over Sam's Club because of its organization and cleanliness. The employees are friendly and helpful once you can find one. From what I understand Costco pays their employess $20 an hour!!! They all look very professional."""""""

<review>We had a weekend visit to Phoenix to catch the Padres Spring training game in Peoria and also the Suns/Hornets game at American Airlines arena about a month ago. \n\nIn any case, we ended up in Scottsdale on Friday afternoon and we all had decided to get something to eat. Pizza was the choice and we stopped off at Oregano's. Probably THE best choice that was made that day. The outdoor patio was the location for our afternoon meal. We had to start off with some drinks so beers and cocktails were ordered up and contemplated the menu selections while waiting. Now the food: \n\nStarters: Oregano's Favorite (salad) - Delicious honey vinaigrette dressing and we added some fresh Parmesan to boot. KickBUTT Garlic Bread topped with cheese and marinara on the side was actually KickASS. \n\nMain Course: Veggie Wedgie with Sweet potato fries (ordered by my girlfriend) ...couldn't have asked for anything better. The sandwich was quite large and the foccacia bread was a hit with her. The rest of us shared in the 18-inch pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs. The thin crust was amazing and crispy with the savory toppings to put it over the edge. \n\nOur server was nice and attentive, but our order for a pizza slice, salad, and a beer was incorrect the first time out. She made up for it by letting us keep the wrong order AND brought out the corrections. Now that is what I call customer service!! \n\nAdded entertainment value: Seeing cars pull into the small parking lot (which holds about 7 cars max) and watching them maneuver to park and get out of the small lot. We could have sworn we were going to see a little bumper bump or similar but it never did happen. \n\nI wish there were one here in San Diego, but I know that if I find myself back in Arizona, I would definitely visit this place again. The pizza is flat out awesome and it was even better as a late night snack!! Definitely a can't miss dining option!!
</review>
<review>Been there twice for dinner and both times were good. Big open room which gets kind of noisy, but it's a fun place. This is a chain, somewhere between Carabas and Maggianos. I tend to get the veal piccata type of dish at Italian places as a measure, and the veal here was very good. the wines were reasonable, waitstaff attentive, food was good. I looked over at my friend's lasagna and it looked gooey, sloppy, whatever to me. He enjoyed it. The prices were reasonable enough to put Brio on the list for a night out during the week.
</review>
<review>If you can navigate your way through the thirty page menu, you'll find that they actually have some great offerings at the Cheesecake Factory. Portions are huge, usually amounting to atleast two or three meals for yours truly, so taking that into consideration the prices aren't bad. \n\nAppetizers are all tasty, and their versatility on the rest of menu is really quite impressive. My favorite two things on the menu are the fish tacos and the orange chicken. They have completely different flavors and creative takes on traditional dishes. \n\nIt's very corporate, and the rumor on the grapevine is that although it's pretty good money, working there is no fun.
</review>
<review>"""What a nice surprise. This place was really cute and welcoming. It was busy when we arrived but we were seated right away. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. We had a Groupon so we were able to try several things on the menu. We had the white pizza as an appetizer, the pesto penne with chicken, the cannelloni with sausage, the tiramisu, and a cannoli (to go!).\n\nThe white pizza was just okay for me, not much flavor. When I said to my friend \it just tastes like bread and mild cheese\"""", he said \""""that's why I like it.\"""" There was shredded basil on top, which I love, but I think the dish needs more garlic and/or salt. I only had one piece to save room for all the stuff to come.\n\nOur pasta dishes were fantastic. My pesto penne was delicious, I could eat a bowl of it even without the chicken. The tomato sauce that comes with the cannelloni was really good. Even though I have a ton of love for the pesto, I am totally ordering a tomato sauce dish next time! The cannelloni was chock full of sausage. The portion size on the pesto pasta was huge, I ended up bringing half of it home. The pasta dishes were served with a loaf of warm, soft bread and oil/vinegar for dipping. The bread is really good...we finished ours, heh.\n\nWe shared the tiramisu for dessert even though I am not a fan of coffee flavor. It just looked so good. I ended up liking it, quite a bit. My friend was too full to have more than a bite or two, but he agreed it was good. We got a cannoli to go after the busboy said it's his favorite thing and they make 'em fresh. I had it for breakfast this morning...and it WAS good. Really good. The only thing I don't like is when places \""""dress\"""" the cannoli in chocolate drizzle. I will ask them to leave that off next time. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable for the portions and we had a ton of leftovers. Overall it was a great experience and we plan to go back :)"""""""

<review>"""Let me start off with a game. You say \AZ 88\"""". I say \""""French Tits\"""".\n\nStevey said, \""""Hey lets hit up a place for drinks before we go to the SMoCA night!\"""" Me \""""FO SHO-where?\"""" \""""AZ 88\"""" \""""Where the hell is that?\"""" \""""Um...Bonnie, right next door to SMoCA?\"""" Huh? Turns out I have passed this establishment a LOT since I go to SMoCA and Orange Table almost every week. But it was always during the day or late on a Tuesday, so I just saw older sophisticated couples lounging on the patio while riding my bike and figured \""""Meh. Expensive steaks or some shit for rich people. Whiz-ev\"""". \n\nHah...not quite.\n\nNo one was on the patio (does anyone else think it looks eerily like a cross b/w a Star Wars bar and a Flintstones cafeteria?) due to the rare rain, and the place was packed but I managed to get Melinda a seat at the bar. They had this gigantic drink menu and I was treated to an old lady drink-I think I got a gimlet. Hey-I can't do G and T ALL the time (just 98.8% of the time). It was pricey, but why didn't anyone tell me to bring my swimsuit? Cause I could have SWAM in that glass. Check it-that martini glass was as big as my FACE. It was terrifying to balance and I...of course, did end up spilling 20% on my jacket and outfit (clear drinks rule for that purpose) and smelling of eau de alkie. Glad I didn't drive! But then Melinda ended up spilling her drink on the nice ladies slick black jacket that I discretly dried off with cocktail napkins-hey, it was like vinyl, ok? Don't judge!\n\nGlancing around-there are some GAY hotties here. I mean, damn, can I be a gay man just so I can have an iota of a chance of hitting that? All the beautiful people were here-very LA, but not super Snottsdale either. Diverse crowd, well dressed, artsy, big groups of totally random people sitting together, nibbling at the food like doe on a field, grazers really. I started staring at one table in front of us that had the largest bowl of waffle fries. They were hardly eating them. My god. The longer I was there, the more I WANTED THEM. I started thinking \""""Ok-there is a chick-ooo-shes gone-its a bunch of dudes-most of them straight..ok, they will TOTALLY give me a waffle fries..ok, will this make me look coked-up or homeless? Shit. I want one. I'm gonna do it. Fuck it. Ohhhh...shes back. Girls never give food out to random girls. Oh well. Maybe if they leave...and I can grab it before the waiter does...while EVERYONE in the restaurant can see I just grabbed trash off the table in a chi-chi hipster spot...its worth it\"""".\n\nI didn't. I chickened out. But seeing Kristin's review, I wasn't the only one who feels like a Sex and hte City Oliver Twist. \""""Please, sire, one cosmo or waffle frie?\""""\n\nWe thought about getting another drink there but remembered we had paid 15 bucks for a ticket for a reason (art..oh yeah...) Before heading out, we ended up chatting with our bar's neighbors (the one whose coat we soiled a wee bit).  Her and her new roommate received all this food, one that had like pizza with avocado slices and other delicious thing-my eyes were bugging OUT of my head-this food looks AMAZING. At one point I thought she was going to feed me aforementioned slice-and I wouldn't have cared. She noticed my lobster bling and freaked. I looked down, already a lil sloshed (these drinks are STRONG) and thought she was looking at my chest. \""""Huh? They're real\"""", I thought, not very impressive in the Scottsdale world of implants. She corrected me it was the bling, and I said, \""""Oh good....my breasts aren't very impressive and I was wondering why you were checking them out.\"""" \""""Honey-you have FABULOUS tits. You have FRENCH TITS honey, and they are SEXY. WORK THEM.\""""\n\nAll right.\n\nOnce again. \""""Az 88?\"""" \""""French Tits\""""\n\nADDENDUM:\n\nHad an actual meal here-get here before 8pm on Friday to avoid more than a 20 minute wait for a table, btw. I had the shrimp cerviche, which was an amazing deal at 9 bucks for a meal instead of an appetizer. Primo avocado, delish shrimp with the fresher salsa and delectible chips, I didn't offer it to share with my fellow dining companions. Since they had the BLT with avocado and bacon and the infamous waffle fries, I asked him to add a small plate with a side of mayo for me to devour with them. And man, they are GOOD-the guys ate their fries before their sandwich! And they only charged me a buck extra for the huge plate of waffle fries I couldn't even finish. Extra star!"""""""

<review>Came here with friends on a Friday night.  The place was packed and there was a waitlist started.  Good thing part of our group was inside already eating and had reserved our seats.  The food was pretty tasty and the portions were big.  My friend I split a chicken bowl.  It filled us both up.  Our friends got other items on the menu and most of us finished our food.  Just by the looks of the crowd, it doesn't look like this place would be a disappointment.  You should try this place out if you're in the area.

<review>Love Famous Dave's!!!\n\nThe smoked brisket just melts in your mouth and the pulled pork is equally FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!!! This is typically what I order when I go there for lunch on the weekends. Their lunch menu, which is available all the way to 5:00 PM, is a great deal. I usually get the two meat one (already mentioned which meats I prefer), with a side of slaw, green beans as a replacement for a corn cobette, and a corn muffin. Usually scaled down lunch portions are not as satisfying as their relative dinner portion. This lunch portion, however, is more than enough food to stuff your gord.\n\nWill I go back to Famous Dave's, specifically the one at San Tan? You're darn right I will again-and-again-and-again.

<review>"""This place has been on my \to try\"""" list for about 10 years, and after a Saturday afternoon game at Tempe Diablo, we finally swung by. \n\nThe meal was delightful.

<review>"""I work for the airlines and love barbecue so Haps is the \only\"""" place. Honey Bears is a joke and quite simply their is no great barbecue in the entire valley. Period! \n\nAnyone who thinks otherwise is not very well traveled.\n\nThe four star rating I give Haps is based on the Arizona \""""handicap\"""" scale. Their biggest problem is the meat inconsistency, from day to day they can easily slide to 3 ... and lord help me ... 2 Arizona stars. \n\nI don't know who manages this joint but ... Dude!\n\nSo why am I a regular at Haps, well I love barbecue and have learned to navigate the mine fields. Luckily the sauce is always consistent and if push comes to shove you can always drown the poor beast. However on the occasional excellent day, no sauce is required. Go figure! \n\nThe most consistent meat is the Ribs, the really safe bet is to buy the ribs individually, they tend to use the best center cuts. The beans are always excellent and the garlic mashers are the other stand out.  The rest of the sides are downright embarrassing, in fact the lack of imagination is appalling. Once again ... Dude!\n\nHaps really needs a proper master smoker who can bring back meat consistency and dream up some edible sides. Then they would really deserve a proper 4 star rating. \n\nUntil then ...

<review>Did you know that Ten is owned by SRG?  Sapporo Restaurant Group... you will notice the similarities in the restaurants if you've been to both.\n\nTen Sushi Asian Fusion is the full name of this restaurant... and that is exactly what they have to offer.  I've been on several occasions to dine in and I've also picked up food for 'take-out.'  As Josh said almost a year ago, the service can sometimes be disappointing.  However, if you get a good waiter / waitress, you'll have a great experience.  Minus one star for the gamble...\n\nOn to the food...\nFirst, if you are watching your spending, you may want to take advantage of Ten's daily happy hour from 4p - 7p.  They offer deals on drinks, sushi, and appetizers.\n\nI recommend starting with lobster dumplings - steamed just right and served with a yummy dipping sauce.  However, Ten offers regular edamame and spicy edamame too - I'd never seen this before!  Their house salad with ginger dressing and their seaweed salad are pretty similar to what you might order at any other sushi restaurant.\n\nIf you're making a meal of sushi, there is plenty to choose from... I love the Ten roll  and spicy scallop handroll, but I'm sure there is something for everyone... \n\nIf you choose to go with the asian/fusion selections, I will recommend the KABAYAKI SCALLOPS.  The dish has not let me down and the scallops are prepared in a wok with fresh asparagus and shitake mushrooms.  For the health conscious, you can choose from white or brown rice!\n\nThere are plenty of vegetarian options and a special 'ten and under' portion of the menu if you bring the kiddies!  This is a good place for groups and I've never had to wait for a table here either!
</review>
<review>NOTE: This is  not a 'walk to' restaurant if you are cruising Kierland....hopefully someone will think of building a pedestrian bridge from Kierland.\nA Tuscan feel upon entering - to me if smelled of crusty bread too!!\n\nI think the restaurant had only been opened a few days - so everything was quite new - including the service staff. No worries there.\n\nWe stopped in for a quick lunch - they had a great selection of salads - good portion sizes!.\nWill be back.

<review>I  went here while in Phoenix on business a couple of months ago. I was looking for a good restaurant not too far from my hotel, and although this seemed to be in a weird location the food is great! I had the chicken and waffles, and it was delicious! Cheddar waffles...  crispy deep fried chicken... it was amazing! So rich and decadent, but a perfect treat after hiking Camelback. \n\nI also had their chocolate cake which was good, but not particularly memorable. \nThey also serve cookie dough balls at the end of the meal. Ours were stale and tasted like they had been in the fridge too long. I think they would stay fresher and taste better longer if they were dipped in chocolate.

<review>I would like to mention that the Mesa office is NOT closed. I have an appointment to go there today. I believe their Gilbert office is still open as well. They are are very good doctors office. I can almost always get a same day appointment or an appointment within a couple of days. Even if they are booked up, they will find a way to squeeze me in if it is something urgent (like a migraine). Dr. Jensen is very caring and listens.

<review>"""Delux is a reliable late-night dining and drinking destination.  For us, we were pretty hungry after watching a Spring Training game, and there weren't a ton of late-night spots.  Luckily, this place is open until 2am, every day!  And, luckily, it reminds me of the movie Tron, which I love, inside, with neon blue lights all up in your face!\n\nBetween the bf and I, we ordered the delux Burger and the Standard Classic Burger.  If you tell them you want it cooked medium-rare, they actually know what that means!  Pink and tender on the inside, light brown on the outside, and soooo yummy.  We also shared a beer flight, which was pretty cool, and some \a la cart\"""" fries, which are presented to you in a mini shopping cart.\n\nConvenient, cute, kitschy, yummy, along with a side of good service.  I recommend!"""""""

<review>Oh breakfast, you're my best friend. Let's be pals forever and for always.\n\nButterfields offers so many choices, it's almost absurd. You can choose between breakfast or lunch.. Although for me, it's no contest. Breakfast wins every time. \n\nThe skillet I ordered started with a hash brown base, topped with peppers, chorizo and avocado then topped with two over easy eggs. It originally came with cheese, but they left it off for me. This comes with your choice of pancakes or grits. I picked whole wheat pancakes. Sooooo good. Everything was delicious. Even the fresh squeezed OJ and I don't even really like oranges. \n\nThe service was very friendly and prompt. I could seriously eat just about everything on the menu. I can't wait to go back.
</review>
<review>Finally, a place to get an exceptional steak without going to one of the 'Prime' restaurants.  We've been looking since moving here a few years back for a descent steak  and  I've had some good ones but none as good as here.  While it won't rival the prime cut steaks, it is quite close and at only $21 for a 12oz ribeye and a loaded potato, what a deal. My wife had the spiced chicken pasta bowl and I'd give it 4 stars too, though I thought a little more chicken and less pasta would of been the perfect touch.\n\nThe onion ring appetizer is very nice as is the ambiance  and  service.\n\nWhile its a 25 minute drive for me, I'd make the trip again and again.
</review>
<review>Hadn't been to this place in a while but swung by the other day after hanging out with a friend at the Baseline Sports Bar just down the plaza. Once I was inside I remembered why I like it, damn good coffee simple as that. The interior is cool and the people who work there are really nice. I wouldn't say punk gallery meets retro-Victorian (it's not really either of those things I think) but it is definitely a great place for a coffee
</review>
<review>Another place I love... and it's fat free, so I don't feel as guilty! :-)\n\nI find it very interesting and kinda funny to read about people complaining about prices. Mojo provides these mondo cups to fill, but that doesn't mean you have to fill it to the top. I suppose if I was planning on taking a pint home, I might be a lil' grumpy at having to pay 10 bucks. Then again, any ice cream/yogurt parlor you go to will charge you more than the grocery store...\n\nAnyways, moving on... so, I love how the set-up allows you to sample the yogurt and put on your own toppings. I normally get a couple of different flavors and mix them together. My friends and I all agreed that the pricing was pretty fair. Usually I spend around $2.50, maybe $3 at the most. The yogurt is always pretty fresh too. Good thing they don't have one by my house...
</review>
<review>I finally made it here after some comments by an industry worker. She told me they had absinthe, so I had to check it out. Mansinthe, Pernod and one fakey are served and made with a drip fountain. However I think they need a lesson and proper glassware. NO FIRE IS INVOLVED WITH ABSINTHE and one needs a straight stemmed glass. 3 parts water, 1 part absinthe with sugar cube, stir thoroughly to dissolve the sugar, then a little ice on top. Rocks glasses aren't the way to go, it splashes and it's just plain incorrect. \n       Anyway, loads of good points - decent beer selection for the freshman beer snob, and there are even some good surprises such as the Leffe and Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA. 22-ounce bombers of Arrogant Bastard and Rogue brown are also on offer. Way cool little place. Good liquor selection. Service is perfect, more attentive than my local! Maybe I should start going where I feel more like a VIP than a taken-for-granted shlub. \n      I was in this happy hour on Monday (free fajita bar, drink discounts!), and I don't think I want to come any time else - waiting ages for a drink and squeezing by throngs isn't my idea of fun. However I guess it should be easy squeezing by a bunch of skinny, assless fixie hipsters.\n      I spied a number of unique liquors, even CHARTREUSE VERTE! What a treat to sip and let explode in your mouth. Lots of unique drinks on the menu, recommended for quieter times.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nI've been reading other reviews, and I saw some mentions about bad service. I'm disheartened by this but I've never been in when the gal was working.\nTry coming in at a different time, LIKE WHEN TONY IS WORKING SOLO. He's pure professional, and if you come in often enough he remembers your name. With me it was after twice. \nI strongly recommend Monday happy hour. FREE FAJITA BAR 5pm!\nPlease trust me on this.

<review>Went on my birthday after St. Francis had an hour long wait.  Very happy with our decision.  Had the ginger martini.  Very sweet, but very good.  Then, we shared the vegetarian appetizer plate.  The corn fritters are mind blowing good!  Never had anything like that before.  I had the tofu pad thai, which was perfect!  The hubby had the mahi mahi which was good, but could have used more sauce. Our friends split the yellow curry which was some of the best I've had in town.  Great heat and flavor.  Bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated.  The whole place had a positive vibe and friendly (though not the most prompt) service.  Will go back again for sure!
</review>
<review>Co-workers told me about this place, so decided to check it out for happy hour.  Good crowd and multiple TV's showing the MLB playoffs, Thursday NFL and ASU game.  Enjoyed the Prime Dip with fries and it was very good.  Meat was tender and the quantity of food was really good.  People at the bar that I talked to said the burgers they had were awesome as were the chicken skewers.  Brews were by the bottle, so no draft beer.  Nice atmosphere and very friendly service.

<review>So, i've worked at two yummy burger places (Delux and Fez), so I think I know a good burger when I'm presented with one.  Two Hippies is yummy, nothing fancy, nothing incredible, but what do you expect for $5? I got yummy seasoned fries (which were soggy, but the irony is I LOVE soggy french fries!), and the burger had yummy carmelized onions, which is Delux's secret!\n\nThe best surprise was the owner, his customer service was incredibly great! Best I've had in a long time. SUPER nice guy, and even gave my fiance a free soda! Gotta luv that Dark Cherry pop!\n\nGo, it's cute and fun!!

<review>Zia, Eastside and Bookmans are the Trinity when it comes to record stores and its kinda funny and convenient that Zia and Eastside they are like 100 feet away from each other. An AWESOME selection of used CDs and good selection of new. They have tons of DVDs and vinyl.  This is your stop for any CD/DVD needs. The Vinyl selection at Zia is better for your new vinyl needs and not so much for used classic vinyl.  Although the back ally parking is kinda sketchy and I can't get my wife to go with me. Plus its lock that there will be a bum out front asking for money. But its worth parking in murder alley and getting hustled by bums. Still 5 stars.

<review>I LOVE this bar. My first visit was in 2004 when it was known as Bar Nun. I'd just moved to AZ and I was drawn in by the neon green light and funny name. Little did I know it was the beginning of a love affair. \n\nSince I didn't know anyone yet I went by myself and sat at the bar. The staff was friendly and so were the patrons. Some of the patrons turned out to be a little too friendly, and the bartender, Jennifer, insisted that the barback walk me to my car to ensure my safety. As if that wasn't enough to make a fan out of me, I found out they serve $2 Blue Moons all day Saturday and the food is awesome!\n\nThe burgers are great, and you can order them rare if you like. I also became addicted to their BBQ chicken sandwich. And the wings. They'll grill them instead of fry them for you which is a bonus. In fact I don't thing there is anything that I have tried and disliked here.\n\nThursday-Sunday night they usually have a pretty decent cover band. Usually classic rock or 80s stuff. They also have NTN and a ton of TVs if you're into sports.\n\nI was so in love that when it came time to move from my apartment, I made sure my new house was within walking distance. Not that you'd need to walk, (since half the year it is hot as hell even at 2am I can see why you wouldn't want to walk) they offer a free ride program on the weekends where they'll pick you up and drop you off. That way you don't have to worry about Sheriff Joe and wearing pink undies at Tent City.\n\nWow, I kinda wanna move back now. CK's I miss you!!!

<review>"""If Postino is your quintessential laid back Southwestern wine bar, then Cheuvront is the quintessential urban wine bar - sleek, hip, modern, fantastic wine list, delicious cheeses, great food (and a nice variety), amazing desserts, and friendly staff.  What more could you want?  \n\nIt's dangerous that I live right by this place because I'm in here a lot.  I knew it would be great from the first time I was here.  The bartender Jeff is truly outstanding - incredibly friendly, knowledgeable about the wines and cheeses (but not in a snobby way), and a good conversationalist (never a \how's the weather today?\"""").  On more than one occasion he's slipped me a couple complimentary wine/cheese tastings.  \n\nI like the James Bond they generally have projected onto one of the walls with the sound off.  I know lots of people don't like the distraction, but I think it just adds to that urban contemporary feel.  They also have a small lcd tv above the bar that they'll put anything on, from the Food Network to Dancing With The Stars to the DBacks game - whatever you're into that night.\n\nThe sit-down wine tastings are fun and interesting (and not that expensive) and each showcases a different specific wine making region (or a specific vineyard).  You will likely be introduced to one or more delicious and inexpensive wines you never would have otherwise known about, and they give you the opportunity at the end of the tasting to purchase the bottles at a reduced price.\n\nThe only downside is that I've gained 10lbs eating cheese and drinking wine."""""""

<review>"""I visited the petroglyphs at Deer Valley today; I am sooo impressed! The building is unassuming and looks pretty vacant inside at first glance. But the information in center is really thoughtful, homespun and introspective. It's also fast moving because the staff knows you want to get outside and see those rocks!\n\nThe outdoor path to the basalt rock mound is wide and clear, though a little scary with all it's \rattlesnake habitat\"""" signs. I'm not gonna lie: the petroglyphs are awesome. There are about 1500 images scattered across the rocky hill, and it seems like they are all facing the same side. It appears that the hill and the the rocks were very important to the people who carved these images and many present day tribes claim symbolism that pertains to their culture is found on the rocks, so maybe it was important for more than one group. My guess is the location was important because it was related to some ancient volcanic activity; that is how basalt is formed. \n\nAnyway, totally rad reserve and museum and clearly i'm a huge geek. the end."""""""

<review>UPDATE:  I hate to take away a star, but they've since lost a star in my book due to inconsistancy with offerings.  What they consider their best sellers and best desserts they don't even carry all the time.  Boo.\n\nIt's rare to find a patisserie that I can rave about, especially because I do a lot of my own desserts at home.\n\nWhat I look for in a good dessert:\n\nIf it's a rich dessert, it should be thick and moist or indulgently creamy.  Eating a rich dessert should make you feel sexy and naughty, like stealing a peek at a hot guy across the way to find he's looking at you too.\n\nIf it's a light dessert, it should be just sweet enough to invite you in bite after bite.  It shouldn't make you feel guilty, but it should satisfy a sweet tooth at the same time.\n\nArai has both for the taking.\n\nConveniently next to Fujiya, a cute little Japanese market, this bakery has a small selection of desserts, but what they do create, they do well.\n\nThe Green Tea Mousse is to die for, resuscitate, and die for again!  The light pillowy mousse has just enough hint of green tea to let you know what you're eating, and isn't so sweet you feel like you just invested in grills made out of sugar crystals.  \n\nIt's pretty much the only thing I order there, although I've tried the fruit tart as well (delish too!) and I've heard the blueberry mousse is great, but they seem to run out when I get out there.  On top of the desserts, they offer fresh breads and cakes to order.\n\nThe staff is friendly, which is always a plus.\n\nI can't wait to get back there to try their other offerings!

<review>This small, unassuming Thai restaurant boasts a clean, contemporary interior. The staff were quick to acknowledge my friend and I and the early evening hours, before the normal dinner crowd would start streaming in. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and genuine.  We ordered two iced Teas that were subtly flavored -but not sweetened.  They were refreshing and delicious! We also began with an order of the chicken satay before deciding on our entrees.  The satay was visually brighter than I had encountered before- almost Tandoori orange.  There were several large pieces skewers- enough for 4 people that did not want to ruin their appetite.  For us 2, it was very generous portion, but we soldiered on.  Very nicely seasoned while paired with a Thai peanut sauce.  The large menu took us a while to go through, but we made our decisions and figured we would definitely come back to try something else. My friend chose a spicy Tofu dish that was very satisfying.  I took on the red curry panang which also did not disappoint.  The server brought our meals promptly and after we filled up as much as possible, he brought us a couple of take out cartons.  Excellent deal as this was enough for another meal!\nAnother star may be earned when I have had time to return and make sure this was not a fluke!  Great recommendation from a friend at work.

<review>"""I agree with Ben H. \nThe jokes about starving Ethiopians are not only old, they are ignorant and tired. \n\nThat being said, I would also like to address the age old question: to Lalibela or to Blue Nile? \n\nWell, I was a die-hard Lalibela fan. It seems to me that those who eat meat prefer Blue Nile, while those who chomp veggies like Lali-better. I have been both a meat-eater and a vegetarian at both places, and I have to say that based on the Ethiopian cuisine, Lalibela wins for me every time. The spicy chicken use to be my favorite... well, you can read my Lalibela review too. \n\nSo what brought me back to Blue Nile? Chef Ron. On Sundays and Mondays (from open at 11am until close at 10pm), Chef Ron serves up the very best in RAW CUISINE! \n\nThat's right, folks. Chef Ron is the resident expert in raw vegan cuisine and he shows off his talents at Blue Nile two days per week. Before you think, \why would I pay for a bunch of raw rabbit food?\"""", you should know that raw cuisine has depth, complex flavors, and usually requires a sophisticated palette. I like it anyway. \n\nAfter some raw dolmas (I wasn't so big on the collard greens wrapping), Super Yogi and I ordered the living lasagna while hubsky went for the onion bread sandwich. After the requisite \""""my food is cold\"""" jokes, we dug in. It was tasty. The flavors of the zucchini flat noodles with the spinach and mushrooms (which I usually avoid)... the tangy marinara... and most of all the cashew ricotta... ok, it would have been nice if it was a little warm, but it was delectable. \n\nHubsky's sandwich was tasty, but the grain mustard was a little much for me. The sandwich was packed with tasty veggies and tons of flavor. \n\nI saved room for the cinnamon roll, which apparently is a staple while the rest of the menu changes based on local availabilities. It looks small, but it packs a punch. \n\nThe thing with raw cuisine is that you can't have expectations. For instance, if you order a cinnamon bun and expect a warm doughy mess, you'll be disappointed. This is indescribable. No, I tried. I can't make it sound anything close to what it is. Just know, it is cinnamony and rolled up. \n\nSome other sample menu items include mango chili, watermelon gazpacho, zucchini hummus, banana ice cream, and orange cream pie with dark chocolate crust. \n\nHave I convinced you yet? Get off your butt and go!"""""""

<review>i enjoy this place very much. not only is it convenient and close to home, but the food is pretty good. i especially like the walnut shrimp, sesame chicken, sesame beef. the only downside is this place is very small so i suggest that if you live near the area, i would just do take-out so you can enjoy eating it at home. i like the fact they place it in plastic to go containers that you can save and re-use. the delivery time is fast and they provide coupons with good deals. sometimes hole-in-the-wall places are the secret and this place is my go to place for quick, good chinese food. i go here at least once every two weeks.

<review>"""Great view of the brewing equipment as you walk in - this is a true brewery that happens to have seating  and  televisions at the front entrance.  It has both a clean  and  upscale feel along with being in a \warehouse\"""" type place where all the beers are made.  \n\nAll of the beers were fresh and had a rather light  and  clean taste.  The pale lager seems to be suited for the Miller crowd, but for those who appreciate craft beer the other offerings are worth seeking out.  Hefe-weizen has a good banana component, Scottish has a pleasant toffee-caramel sweetness, and the pale ale is modestly hopped and very approachable.\n\nStaff was pleasant and the prices were reasonable for Tempe.  Multiple hi-resolution TV's are placed throughout the area for games and such.  \n\nGlad to see another brewery in Tempe again and I hope some of their beers will reach a pub near me in Glendale."""""""

<review>I had Sunday Brunch here a couple of weeks ago and was anticipating a great meal. The first thing that struck me was that our group of 5 were the only people in the restaurant at noon on a Sunday. We were the only ones there when we arrived and the only ones there when we left. Surprising. The person serving us seemed to be pulling double duty. While I can't be sure of this, his frequent and lengthy absences had me suspicious that he was, in fact, cooking our meals. \n\nThat being said, the food was excellent. Eggs Benedict is the bellwether of all brunch meals for me, so that's what I ordered. The latte that I ordered was exceptional. At $5 a pop, I easily could have run up a $30+ bar tab on these alone. To keep costs under control, I made the switch to regular coffee, which was also excellent. \n\nAll in all, a great meal. My only disappointments were the lack of crowds and spotty service. Hopefully, some of you will read this and put Coup Des Tartes on your Sunday brunch rotation!
</review>
<review>Mike, the manager of this location, is great.  He really cares about the quality of his operation and the service delivered.\n\nYes, it is still fast food.  But the little things really make a difference when comparing mass-produced food experiences like fast food, and, on that score, this particular Arby's is a winner.  Clean as a whistle and you get treated like a human being and not just a number. \n\nExpect to be greeted warmly and to get your food promptly.   Mike makes a real difference because he takes his job seriously and trains his staff accordingly. Ring the bell on the way out if you enjoyed your experience - and get a chorus of Thank Yous! from the staff for your trouble.\n\nHighly recommended.

<review>"""Shoes.  Shoes, betch. As the \Home of the Footstrike Analysis\"""", Tucson-based Performance Footwear shows it means business when it comes to finding the right running shoes for its customers.\n\nI bought some new shoes here the other day and figured they would have me try on some shoes and have me run around the store to see if it was the right fit.  But no, they had me get on a treadmill, roll up my black slacks to my knees (yeah, not so hot) and run while they video recorded it.  We reviewed it in slow-mo and determined the right shoe for my arch as she explained how the shoe cushioning could help correct my footstrike and protect my feet. \n\nIt's a small store, but they have nearly all brands represented (Asics, New Balance, Nike, Adidas, etc.).  The salewoman was very helpful, thorough and personable. They also offer 30 percent discount on clothing when you buy shoes.  Nice, eh?"""""""

<review>I would give My Big Fat Greek Restaurant 4.5 stars if possible, but since I can't, I'm rounding up in this instance.\n\nWe frequent the location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona center. The outdoor patio seating is great, it has a nice view of the Arizona center plaza  and  park, with the calming sounds of the waterfalls right near the patio.\n\nFor starters, try the Greek fries. They serve a heft plate of french fries topped with a tart lemony sauce and cheeses (including feta). This app is delishhhh.\n\nThe Happy Hour (4-7pm) specials get my stamp of approval. They offer $3 large beers on tap, including some super good beers like Alaskan Amber. They're worth a visit just for their beer specials.\n\nFor the main courses, one of our favorite dishes is the pizza salad. You get a plate of warm, toasty pizza crust with a delicious salad thrown on top. The salad is dressed with feta cheese and a tasty balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It is very difficult for me to NOT order the pizza salad when I'm at MBFG restaurant.\n\nAnother good dish is the Vegetarian Mousaka (http://twitpic.com/46x9h ), however it can be a little bit sweet. The lemon potatoes and lemon rice are very tasty, if you're into lemon flavored sides. \n\nGive MBFG restaurant a try, even if it's just for their happy hour beers.

<review>Lee Lee is more than an Oriental Supermarket... it's international.  They have aisles of things from South America, Africa, and Great Britain in addition to the expected Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, and things from other Asian countries.\n\nI found some Dutch things there that I had not seen outside of the Netherlands, and some things from South America that a friend from Dominican Republic would bring home with her.\n\nThe place is huge, and always crowded.  In this case, crowds are good.  I am always able to get help finding things I need from other shoppers who can read the Chinese and Japanese labels.\n\nThey have restaurant in the corner.   Walk behind the low wall  on the north side of the building and through the door into the seating area to find a counter that has light fare.  That's were you can find the boba drinks.  Boba rulz!
</review>
<review>I give this place a 5-star review because of the Jokester Room. Every Thursday night they have a free bues concert by Hans Olson, who is an amazing musician. He can play any song you can throw out at him. I really wanted to hear Me and Bobby McGee, and he did a beautiful job. \n\nThe beer is cheap, good specials, and the pineapple bacon pizza looked very tasty. I'd recommend checking this place out if you're in the area. If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a regular.
</review>
<review>Now worthy of 5 stars for replacing their toilet with one that actually flushes. It's always nice when a place that sells diuretic beverages has a working toilet.\n\n---\n\nThe baked goods are baked right there in the coffee house, by their employees.  The coffee is roasted right there, on site. Iced tea refills are free, bitches. The baristas are hep cats who ride fixie bikes. Now, I like to coast, but shit...  Gotta give them cred. If you go often enough, the other regulars will be friendly. If you hate Mac laptops, you probably should stay away. The new tables are great. There are power outlets everywhere. It's next to Pane Bianco. I run into my homies there on the regular. When it comes to coffee shops in CenPho, there is no competitor. Jeff, the owner, is a cool dude. The seating outside is nice. I have been known to spend all day there, and use it as my office away from home and my real office. I seriously probably spend about 16 hours a week there or so, maybe more some weeks, working on my laptop and occasionally people watching. Did I mention that I kind of like this place?
</review>
<review>I think this is my favorite restaurant in the city. I love the innovative idea, the food and wine pairings are superb, and most of all that you don't have to choose what you want... you only tell them what you don't want... because you know what you don't want but sometimes it's hard to decide what you do.  Well, they do that part for you and all of your guests, and they bring different items for everyone at the table. It is a lovely, wonderful, delicious experience.

<review>Been here multiple times over the past few years--most recently yesterday for lunch with my family. To start, I'm bummed that the foccacia bread with tomatoes are now off the menu--what?! that was the BEST. I do a low-carb diet, and when I knew we were going to CPK, I saved my carb calories just for that! Bummer.\n\nHostess was nice--let me sit in our booth before the entire party arrived (crazy construction traffic on the 101--what?!).  Booth and silverware was clean....food was great, as usual.\n\nWe ordered a trio of salads---Miso, BBQ chicken, and Chinese Chicken Salad. Generous portions--I swear that half is almost the same size as the full! Our drinks never saw the bottom of the glasses---attentive waitress.\n\nBummer #2--I KNEW I had left my cell phone/case at the booth as soon as I drove away, and I went to check and they took my name and number and said they'd call if they found it. I KNOW I left it there, so after an hour I called back. Whoever I spoke with was kinda testy and rude--that pissed me off.\n\nAll ready to boycott this place for the rest of my being, at 904pm I got a phone call from a much-nicer manager, telling me they had scoured our booth finally and, voila, there appeared my belongings! I heart that nice man---and the boycott is now off.

<review>Recently moved back to Mesa, I have been on the hunt for a place to get a good sandwich and fresh bread. This place now tops my list of places in the East Valley to get a good sandwich. My first sandwich was the Atlantic Haddock Provencal. A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.

<review>This was my first encounter with Tapas and I have got to say, it was amazing!! My sister and I got the oppurtunity to attend the Yelp Elite Event held here, and we really enjoyed ourselves.\n\nIt's a FAAAR drive from my house (almost an hour!) but it was nice to have a change in scenary and pace. So we took my car out there and when we got there, we rode the elevator and were very impressed with their amazing decor. Swanky, fresh, and lusty... it was casual, chic and comfortable at the same time!\n\nWe were met with a very helpful staff who enjoyed seeing our reactions to all the great food! Maybe it was the entire pitcher of sangria I had to myself... but those were the BEST damned baby back ribs I have ever had! Sweet, spicy and falling off the bone! They were so succlent, I wanted to cry. I had a chance to talk with their head chef and complimented them on all the great food, the asparagus was devine as was the chorizo and potato dish! My favorite for the night! I guessed how it was made and wasn't told a THING! DAMNIT! (grrr!) I fell in love with the Spanish tortilla which is more like a frittata or really thick omlette. \n\nEvery dish was spot on and made me want to cry... or was that the entire pitcher of sangria again? I unno, but it was incredible and the back patio was amazing! Perfect for parties and out door dining. I would recommend this for anyone willing to travel to it's far north location.\n\nTo my yelpers: if this is far for you, like it's far for me... I still say GO! Give sitting indoors a try and tell me how it goes. Order the baby back ribs and chorizo potatos and be ready to beg the chef for the secret recipe like I did! Try the sangria, but don't drink the entire pitcher like I did... I wound up talking about Dominatrix Dungens in an Applebee's parking lot that night!! Not a pretty sight! :(

<review>I had mini date night and we decided to come here on a whim. I mean it is close to my house so why not. Plus they have reverse happy hour and their boneless wings were on special in which they were half off all month with any drink purchase. Score. My friend decided that he wanted to try the Eclipse Burger challenge in which included 3 half pound angus patties, topped with 4 strips of bacon, cheddar and swiss cheese with crispy onions and a side of fries. If he finished it, he got a t-shirt and his picture placed on the wall. Well he finished it with no problem. He doesn't eat like that all the time and he said that he was full but not overly stuffed. Kudos to him. It looked amazing and I so wanted a bite, but alas he had to finish it all himself. Hmm maybe next time I will try. LOL ( NOT!)
</review>
<review>So a group of us decided to get brunch here this am and boy am I glad I did. I started with a super killer spicy bloody Mary that came with a little beer chaser...awesome. I got the green Chile meat loaf with fried eggs. I can easily say this was among  the best meat loaf I've ever had .the texture was perfect, flavor deep and rich and it worked sooooo well with my over easy eggs. I can't wait to gio back and try some of the other stuff on the menu....awesome!!!!

<review>I read about Los Reyes on Yelp earlier this year and have really wanted to try it. My boyfriend and I went on Friday and we REALLY enjoyed it! I used to be obsessed with tortas when I lived down in Guadalajara, so I was especially excited. I ordered a torta with chopped steak, onions, peppers, cheese, beans, avocado and more. Delicious! I could only eat half (half is about the size of a burger). I also got an horchata - really refreshing after the spicy-ness of the peppers and hot sauce. \n\nMy boyfriend got a steak torta and a Mandarin Soda. He LOVED it. He somehow managed to eat the whole thing! \n\nDefinitely want to go back and try more of their food and fresh juices. Highly recommend Los Reyes!!!
