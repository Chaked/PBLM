<reviews><review>Don't buy Nike sneakers if you want to return or exchange them.. I've bought many from them. I went this week  and bought 2 pairs of Nike SB's that were already over retail price as it is.. I tried on one side then bought them... When I got home I realized that one of the shoes were damaged.. It's only been 2 days and they said they can't take it back.. I've bought many shoes there and this will be the last time... I'm from Nor Cal and people are crazy about sneakers out there and all the shops will accept a return or exchanged within 14- 30 days.. This was the first place that does not do that.. Why? Because sneakers and SB's are not big in AZ... They don't sell here.. I wouldn't buy them there if I were you.

<review>We don't have this fast food restaurant in Canada so I had to come back here after a stop in Montana three years ago. I remembered the burger to be delicious. I know its fast food but that doesn't mean it can't taste good. \nI had the original burger and the onion rings. I can say that while I ate every last ring, they were good but certainly not great. I had the burger the way it came and maybe I added bacon last time. It was good, I suppose even really good considering we are at a fast food joint. Its not going to unseat the Big Mac or even the Quarter Pounder in my mind but it was good. I think maybe i could eat here once a month, tops. \nMy wife had the Guacamole and Bacon burger. She really loved it. I don't know, not my thing but she insisted I try it. After saying no thank you at least six times I finally graciously accepted a bite. Like I said, not my thing. \nShe also had a creamsicle milkshake which tasted just like a creamsicle. Again she enjoyed it.
</review>
<review>YES, this place has been around forever, though it isn't that great so I'm not sure why.  There are plenty of other cheap (and better) options in the area.\n\nI used to come here for takeout quite a bit a few years back and remember it being better; not sure what happened.  I went today and it was definitely below average.  \n\nThe House Fried Rice is really the only thing I've ever eaten here that was legitimately good.  Everything else is utility.

<review>"""I don't even know where to begin - this place is downright awful. From quality of 'management' to condition of the rooms, Motel 6 Scottsdale is truly a dump of a hotel in every sense of the word. Not only was my bed infested with living bugs, but the shower was broken, and green mold was all over the baseboard. When I asked the 'manager on duty' (heavy set, tattooed gentlemen named Michael) if he was aware that his rooms were infested with insects, he started laughing and accused me of making the whole thing up. I proceeded to return to my hotel room to photograph the bugs to prove I was being truthful. Michael continued to giggle and said \Sorry, nothing I can do.\"""" I then demanded my money back, which Michael initially refused to offer. He finally refunded my money after I threatened to take Motel 6 to small claims court. All I can say is, whoever the 'real' GM of this particular Motel 6 is - you need to take a long hard look at the quality of employees you hire. This experience will keep me from staying at any Motel 6 ever again."""""""

<review>"""oyy a miss for me on this one! \n\nI heard about Nourish a few weeks ago and have been meaning to try it...I happened to be in the nabe yesterday early evening and decided to go in. The place is huge but was completely empty...we were welcomed nicely. \n\nIt is vegetarian, vegan, lactose and gluten-free...the menu looked AWESOME - lots of options and great concepts... as I was looking it over, I was already drafting an enthusiastic e-mail in my mind to all my friends who happen to be vegetarian and vegan...and then I saw the note that stands on each table enumerating what nourish is all about:\n\n\everything only sweetened with agave nectar\"""" (omg must come here for lunch tomorrow)\n\n\""""coconut milk instead of cream\"""" (omg Chrissy's bday party must happen here!!)\n\n\""""our sweet potato fries our air fried no oil! (July 4th weekend at Nourish!!)\n\nI was having a pretty good time in my head until the food arrived...\nwe started with the garlic/artichoke hummus:\ndisappointing: it was very small and came with three pieces of sad, wilted old and dirty looking cucumbers and carrots. Surprising as a veggie place you would think that the focus would be on the vegetables being fresh, colorful and appetizing! not so!\n\nnext the \""""kitchen sink\"""" salad with grilled chicken - again a huge miss!  veggies were old, wilted and just sad - chicken was NOT grilled rather that white/diced chicken thing with the bad after taste yuck! (I know its not the most original choice but IT IS a veggie place after all so I thought the salad would be the star...too bad it didn't even get into the local theatre school!!!)\n\nmy husband ordered the garlic/lemon chicken on quinoa salad - more flavorful than mine... but SO small! yes that's another thing.. the portions are tiny - the entree portions look like appetizers...\n\nThings went from bad to worse when our waitress started ignoring us towards the end... I was still hungry after my sad salad so I ordered some of them air fried sweet potato fries... ehhh... and I asked for some ketchup and it took her 1/2 hour to get it to me - she came out six times - yup SIX doing other errands before she got me my ketchup even though we were practically the only ones in the place...\n\nby the time we paid our check... my \"""" imaginary\"""" e-mail to my friends  went from enthusiastic to delete!\n\nI'll \""""nourish\"""" myself elsewhere thank you... dinner  and \""""bachelorette\"""" at my place???"""""""

<review>"""\Living History\"""" in the title is false advertising. We went today and the place was DEAD. There were no re-enactors at all, short of the blacksmith who kept to his forge and a random guy wandering around with an eye patch and a flannel shirt who didn't acknowledge us.\n\nEVERYTHING (except the blacksmith's) was closed off. No gun fights (the nearby shooting range gave us a false hope when we had gotten out of the car), no demos, no people in costume, NOTHING. Even the pigs and chickens near the Northern House were out of sight. \n\nThe buildings were fairly dilapidated, which isn't surprising. But bees and wasps were living in the dried mud of the structures. BEWARE.  \n\nComparing this place to Rawhide isn't quite fair considering the fact that Rawhide's pretty much a set and it's designed for kids. Goldfield would be a closer comparison since it actually looks like a ghosttown with people in costume. At least with those locations you didn't pay anything to pretty much wander around an empty town. At both Goldfield and Rawhide, most things are all in one area with many shops, vendors, activities, people to interact with, and things to see. \n\nNOT SO with Pioneer Village. I might be biased because I also had an injured leg, but everything was spread out. You would walk for 10-15 minutes to a far off building just to stare in the windows at pretty much nothing.  \n\nI really wanted my $7 back. When we approached the girl in the giftshop who was also taking money for admission, she kept giving us a sob story/guilt trip about the economy being bad. If they're all volunteers (all 3 of them) as she said they were, why charge just to walk around and not get to interact with anyone? RIP-OFF. \n\nIf there isn't anything to see but the buildings, no shows or anything, it should be pay-what-you-can/donation at best. \n\nI was going to give this 2 stars out of pity, but at this point even 1 star is generous."""""""

<review>I have tried to love Sprinkles, I really have.\n\nI have been there a handful of times. Bought it for events. Bought it for myself, tempted by the sights. Im a sucker for creative marketing. It looks like it should taste good.\n\nEvery sprinkles cupcake I have ever had (and I have tried at least 3 or 4 flavors) has been LOADED with sugar. Im not talking yum, sugar. Im talking, freaking gross, so full of sugar you cant taste anything else, has no depth of flavor, JUST. SUGAR. Take a spoon, dip it into your sugar bowl, shovel it into your mouth, get the same taste, and save yourself the drive and the $4.\n\nI had read good things about the strawberry, so despite my best judgement I thought it might change my mind about Sprinkles. I bought the strawberry cupcake. The frosting had SO much sugar in it that it was still granulated. Seriously. And the cake, while moist, was so terribly tasteless. I spent $4 on this stupid cupcake and it was so nauseatingly sweet and disgusting that I threw away half of it. I have never thrown away a cupcake in my life. \n\nNever again.

<review>Rating the golf course, horrible!!  Thank goodness there was no one in front of us and we zipped around the course.  They clearly stopped maintaining the course.  Bunkers are concrete, after a few times in them I decided to take it out and not bother hitting it.  No grass around the greens and the greens couldn't hold the ball worth a darn.  One green did have gravel on it, I putted the ball and it wiggled all over the place.  I'm glad I only played there for 15 bucks, which included the golfnow fee.  If your a horrible golfer I'd play there.

<review>"""I would never go back.  It isn't anything special... it is just a store space with a bar and like 4 tables.  The DJ is HORRIBLE!!!

The drinks are watered down and over priced (so unusual for Snotsdale, I know) and the waitresses and bartenders and BIIIIIIITCHES!!  There is just no vibe or atmosphere at this place other than \meat market\""""."""""""

<review>I don't like this Five Guys. \n\nThe hamburgers are insanely overcooked and was a tad on the chewy side.\n\nBut my real gripe is that this place stands on the dust of the Coffee Plantation. A job that saw me through my twenties. Great memories. Reduced to chewy overcooked hamburger.\n\nI might forgive you for moving on Tempe. Maybe one day. I might even like the hockey puck texture on the over blasted meat at Five Guys. \n\nMaybe one day.\n\nMaybe one day.

<review>I had high hopes.\n\nThen I had bites of a pastor taco, carne asada burrito and civiche tostada.\n\nMeat wise, the pastor here is incredible. If I were ever to return on another trip to town, I'll order pastor everything. The carne asada was alright as well, but nowhere near the quality of the pastor and the burrito was pretty boring. \n\nAs for the civiche.... yuck. I should have taken the advice of a coworker who recommended no seafood in the desert. Completely tasteless and overpowered with lime. The avocado chunks tasted like tofu.... gross.

<review>I went to Daphne's today since I love their patio and wanted to leisurely dine outdoors. I ordered the Chicken Ka-bob and the double greek salad and a soft drink for $7.94 today. I love greek salad, but this came nowhere near to my expectations. I am used to a ton of tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, etc. I had two small tomatoes and cucumber slices and two or three olives and a lot of lettuce. I'm used to a greek salad having little if any lettuce. I guess I am spoiled by all the great greek restaurants in Chicago. Time to get busy and find a go to Greek Restaurant in this area.

<review>Our first time here, after driving half an hour to try the place out. A mish mash of Asian dishes, some of which are hit and miss. We had the lettuce wraps appetizer, teriyaki chicken and Korean sizzling short ribs. The taste and sauces on all three were pretty good. The chicken was tender. But there was too little meat in the filling for the wraps - it was mostly just water chestnut. The ribs were not sizzling but lukewarm and were also the toughest I've ever had. Could not even eat half of the dish. The Chef or manager (he didn't introduce himself) made a lot of excuses when he came over to address the problem, like 'people' around here want their meat well done. Well done and overcooked are two different things. Service was below par, with only one waiter trying to keep up with dine in and take out customers. Won't be coming back here again.

<review>My husband and I really wanted to check out this office because it is the closest to us. We had no problem making the appointment for doctor interview at 7:30 a.m., to meet the doctor and promptly showed up at the time of the appointment just to find out that the doctor was not there. In a brief conversation where we stated that we are going to wait until doctor shows up, we were told that we can't meet with doctor regardless of the appointment. Before we could even react office manager Marry Summers informed us that we cannot talked with other doctors, and what we were told is not true. I have to emphasize that Mary Summers was not nice, apologetic, and empathetic about our situation at all. She just wanted us out of the office. I know that everybody has a bad morning, but she was letting it shine. \nMary continued with this; You were informed wrong, and what I am telling you is how it is; You don't need anybody's name but mine; Other people choose the doctor by reading the bio online; This is my office policy.......on and on and on Mary continued to cut us, and see us on the way out.\n \nMaybe those doctors in the office are nice, but why would I bother going through this office representation when even the doctor were not there for their appointment, and I would not see them even if I would wait.....\n\nTo all of you that still wish to try this office, I really wish you good luck.

<review>This place sucks! The owner waited on us and her frizzy nasty hair was hanging down and all over the place. I guess because she had a hat on it was ok YUCK beside that she is a terrible waitress and this is the second time she has waited on us. The prime rib was the absolute worst we have ever had, the mac and cheese was pasta with milk no flavor at all. The owners kid runs around, screams and acts like a heathen and they think its cute and thats what paying customers want to experience when they go in there. We wont be spending anymore money in that place.

<review>I was about to give 2 stars for the baba ganoush, pita, moussaka, and some shredded meat dish that were good. This was despite the many dishes that were very strange. By strange I mean not good....what is this???? and why would this taste this way??? I am not sure how one could mess up penne pasta with Greek dressing or orzo pasta but they managed to make it inedible. Many things looked pretty dry and maybe not from today. The cook staff loading things in using their fingers is a little unappetizing too. Like another review said, maybe they could make it if they took out two buffets and just had two. Then they could focus on the better dishes. The straw that made them get 1 instead of 2 stars was that they charge you $1 for each tap water they serve your table.... Really? $6 for tap water for our table. I admit I am very picky but my husband is not. His motto is quantity over quality. And he said we will not go back. I would rather have one dish cost $10 or more and have it be really good than have 70 ok or inedible dishes. I hope to hear that they shorten the buffet and focus on quality. Oh and the chocolate pudding was spoiled. ;(

<review>"""The folks at Tapino need to buy a dictionary and look up the word \Hospitality\"""".  I have never been so offended in my life as a patron of a restaurant.

When he returned a second time to lecture us like 10 year olds, I canceled the appetizers and we left and went to Mastro's City Hall where we racked up a tab of $1,000 and were treated accordingly.

<review>BEWARE!!!!  I was taken advantage of by Joe and this man lacks honesty.  I had to arrive with the police to retrieve a table he was supposed to call me with an estimate to restore and come to an agreement about a price to sell it.  Instead I received a check in the mail for $250 with a note that he sold it!!!  It was still in his store for a price tag of $1,200 and he was untruthful about even that to the police.  How very sad it took the police to make things right with this dishonest fellow!

<review>This was the last valley casino i had yet to visit, should have left it alone. \n\nThe casino had a nice array of machines, but they need to clean up more oftern, or maybe the patrons need to use an ashtray more oftern.   \n\nyes there is a lot of smoke smell around, but they have a small smoke free area.  \n\nThey also have what looked to be a very nice cafe, the food looked great and the prices were very reasonable, but we were just too tired to stay. \n\nPlayed for about 2 hours and hardly saw anyone win anything, or get any bonuses on the slot machines.

<review>Why oh why is this joint always out of ham and cheese crossaints...prepare people!!!  I really don't think theres anything special about their sandwiches, I've tried a couple of them.  The soup is usually good, the salads are o.k but the cookies are pretty good.  Service is null, I actually caught a couple of the young guys who were making the sandwiches joking about one of the guests (rude).  I never order coffee here anymore because they always find a way of screwing it up.  So why do I keep stopping in here....it must be the cookies.

<review>"""I really doubt Down Under will welcome my review, but I HAVE to do it just to get this off my chest. \n\nI spent a very long and frustrating hour+ this morning on the patio with my dog and some friends. My dog, Peekaboo seemed to enjoy it, but I HATED it! \n\nThere was a \Doggie Day Sunday brunch on the patio\"""" event going on on. I had scheduled a FindMyDogADate AZ Meetup there for this doggie event. All of the tables and chairs were taken when I arrived by the people running their doggie event tables. Eventually I found a table with two wet chairs directly under the very wet misters. (It's no wonder no one wanted to sit there). Since I had four other people coming, I scrounged up more chairs. All of them were directly under the dripping misters.\n\nAfter my friends arrived, I went inside to grab some brunch. They were charging a ridiculous $12 for rubbery whatever that was, cold eggs, rock hard pancakes and a tiny dish of grapes served by a lady who couldn't even tell me the price of the brunch. The orange juice was extra so I asked for a glass of water. I got a plate full of yuck, sat down in the wet chair while the water dripped on my plate of yuck making it even yuckier. I took my uneaten plate back after one bite and told them I would go eat at McDonald's. YUCK!!\n\nThe patio needs to be condemned! I was tempted to call the health inspector! Dogs had pooped on the gravel behind the tables and it wasn't cleaned up. No doggie poop bags were to be found anywhere. Luckily I had brought some with me. After cleaning it up, there weren't any trash cans available to dispose of it!!! \n\nThe \""""waitress\"""" never stopped by our table the entire time!\n\nAll on all it was a very dirty and disappointing experience.

<review>Nick's is local to me and I would have loved to make this a fav as I can walk to it. \nMy first visit I sat in the bar after having sushi next door. This was o.k. and I may repeat this. \nHowever, on my next visit my friend and I tried to enjoy dinner. We were asked to sit at a smaller table outside vs. a larger table for bigger parties. Ok but when some people came in that were repeat customers and they sat at the table we wanted but there were only two, well that was somewhat rude. \nThen the waiter catered to their order and needs over ours. Such as when he did bring our food and asked us if we wanted parmesan cheese. We said yes. He then went to the kitchen and retrieved the food for his favorite customers and then brought the cheese for them and then brought it to us. Maybe they are big tippers but as someone that was looking to be a regular I may have been too. \nThe food was good but for gluten free they really do not have many choices. I have been going to another restaurant in the area and they have excellent choices with better service. Unless I am dragged here again I most likely will not return for their food.

<review>This was one of the worst meals ever. \n\nWe went because my wife received some giftcards from a patients family at the hospital she works at. \n\nThe service was lousy but the food was worse. Bland, uninspired and came cold to boot. They don't have garlic bread? I got a lame excuse for why. I grew up in NY. This is not italian food. A manger stopped by and asked how everything was and we said ok. All she had to do was look at our uneaten plates to know. I really didn't want to complain because I didn't want anything else from them. I just wanted to leave. \n\nWhen we got home I realized that the nice people who had gone out of their way to give my wife a $100 gift card were just ripped off. I wrote to the company to let them know of my experience and have never heard back.  \n\nI have managed and worked at restaurants for over 25 years. I understand it's a tough job. Mistakes happen, but you should address them. \n\nI usually don't complain, I just never go back. This was well beyond bad and the lack of follow up on a guests lousy experience speaks volumes. I will never darken the door of any of the OSI Restaurant Partners establishments (Outback, Fleming's, Roy's, Bonefish) if that's how they treat their guests.\n\nCaveat emptor.

<review>DH and I went here with a group of about ten people for a weekday Happy Hour.  We happened to have our kiddo with us. \n\nThe ambience was nice.  It was dark inside and it was very cozy.  The bathrooms could use some work.\n\nThe food was greasy and nasty.  Stay away from the globby mess of the fundido. It is the greasiest dish I have ever seen served in a restaurant. It looked like oil inside chicken broth.  Gross!\n\nThey have nothing for young kids here. The quesadilla I ended up getting the kiddo was overpriced and she did not like it.  It was served with black on the outside, which was not appealing, and it had greasy cheese inside.\n\nThe margaritas were just okay, but even with happy hour pricing they were not worth bragging home about.\n\nOn the plus side, the servers were very nice, so I'm bumping it up to two stars.\n\nI would NEVER eat here again.
</review>
<review>Cheuvront: oh so disappointing.  I have been to Cheuvront for dinner  twice, both times I walked away disappointed.  I've tried the many dishes including the duck, the chicken, and some appetizers.  My biggest complaint is that the food isn't that great.  It is 3 star food with 5 star prices.  The portions are small (like a tapas bar), which usually doesn't bother me as long as the food is amazing.  But this is not the case with Cheuvront.  I've tried many dishes here that are bland, with no depth of flavor.  There is no beer on tap and service takes a long time.  It's so close to where I live, that I really wanted it to be a neighborhood spot, but the utter lack of value and quality prevents it from doing so.  Either drop prices by 30% or make your food twice as good.

<review>I dated a guy once who told me that Chinese food is like pizza because you can't really mess it up.  Well, the next time I run into him, I am going to send him to Jimmy Woo's.  \n\nFor the last few weeks, I have had a weird craving for Chinese food, and just in case you are wondering, I'm not pregnant.  I decided to give Jimmy Woo's a try today since I drive by the place every day, and I am not a fan of P.F. Chang's across the street.  \n\nWow. That was a mistake.  \n\nI ordered some noodles and pork dumplings, and I was shocked by how BLAND the food was.  If I could chew and swallow air, I think it would taste like the food I got today.  The pork had huge chunks of tendon within it that I couldn't eat half of the meat, and the sauce was so tasteless that I had to put some soy sauce on it which I absolutely hate doing.  Since my craving hasn't been satisfied by this experience, I am going to drive out to Chandler or Phoenix tonight for Chinese food praying for better.

<review>"""Let's get some clarification right now. This is NOT A COOKING CLASS, nor is it a place you can go to learn to cook. Instead, it is simply a place where they have a production line setup with various prepared ingredients and a few select recipes that change every month.

For me, I was greatly disappointed that I basically learned nothing about cooking, and that I couldn't do anything on my own without the prepared ingredients and special process they use here. Plus, they simply sit you at a station and you do the steps noted in their recipe.

<review>"""I came here for their friends and family event, and while I typically wouldn't write about it since it was virtually gratis and it is their start-up week, I didn't even see potential in this place (I went to Bourbon Steakhouse for a similar type of gratis event, and it fucking rocked... I refuse to review them yet because I know I'll be back when they will actually be in operation). As a matter of fact, the only recurring thought I could muster during the entire meal (which, mind you, lasted just under 3 hours) was:\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nFirst bad experience here: sitting on the toilet, as a 5'9\ woman, my feet were dangling. Bizarre. And the stalls are very looney-bin-esque... sterling silver from top to bottom with no obvious ventilation or way out if someone locks you in (yes, paranoid is the word you're searching for). \n\nSecond: The chairs are beyond uncomfortable, but wouldn't be so awful if I hadn't had to endure such a long-lasting meal (note to restaurants: this long-lasting concept? Good for relationships and, like, gum. Not so much for supper).\n\nThird: I've had better food at pretty much anywhere that charges even a fraction of what this place does. It was kind of outrageous, but I didn't begin a violent rampage because, as mentioned, they were buying.\n\nFour: Our wait time in between dishes averaged at about 15 minutes from picking up the dirty plates to dropping new ones. This isn't accounting for how long it took for them to clear our table, despite the 9842759873 servers, bussers, sommeliers, and bartenders milling around (I'm not even counting the armada of hostesses). \n\nI can see many a Scottsdale douchebag or Eurotrash enjoying this place, but it's probably because (pardon me for being caustic) they haven't recovered their taste buds from last night's coke binge.\n\nSidenote: Our server was awesome.

I was excited to try this place as I heard such good things, but when we waited over 10 minutes for our burgers, it was rather disappointing.

I understand that you have to deal with some points on your transactions, but hey that is business and if you feel that this was hitting your bottom line I would suggest you re-evaluate your strategy on pricing. The coffee, meh it was okay but I have experienced way better, please re-consider your 25 cent credit card charge, it's tacky.

<review>I just had dinner here tonight and ordered a side of steamed vegetables for my 15 month old daughter, when our entrees came out I had to ask twice for the steamed vegetables, after several minutes the waiter came back and told me that I could have grilled zucchini or red peppers only and that the executive chef said that was all that was available and they could not do steamed vegetables. I an age where many people have dietary requirements that is never ending a simple request for steamed vegetables is refused. You can bet your bottom dollar I will never recommend this chain to anyone. I can only hope if you have allergies you are very careful at this restaurant as judging from my experience you could end up very sick or in hospital due to the non flexibility of the kitchen and chef.

<review>I was hankering for a good fish dish a la Vera Cruz and decided to try out Mimita's Cuban Cafe since a friend had recommended it. It's sad to say that I was very disappointed with their food. I ordered the Filete de Pescado al Ajo with Moros. Needless to say, aside from the butt load of crushed garlic enough to scare off the vampires on Halloween, the food was bland underneath all that garlic. The only thing that was enjoyable was the Maduros. But it's pretty tough to mess up fried plantain.\n\nI don't see me going back there, nor recommending it to my friends and family...and they call themselves The Best Cuban Food in Town, yuck!

<review>"""Consider yourself warned, do not take your vehicle here! Had a problem with a vehicle and had it towed to Greulich's. The next morning I got a call from one of the \mechanics\"""" telling me that he could not get into the vehicle because the key wouldn't work. I explained that this was because had had the ignition replaced (by them) a year earlier, and that the door key was different from the ignition, and that we always used the key fob to unlock the doors. He explained that the fob wasn't unlocking the doors, and asked if I could bring down the door keys. I agreed to do so, but suggested that he check the battery first. He agreed to do so, and said he would call if he needed me to come down with the key. Later that day another \""""mechanic\"""" called me with an estimate of repairs that included a new window actuator (an extra $200+) that needed to be replaced because the window was broken and stuck in the rolled down position. I explained that this was not the case when it was towed in, and that the other mechanic had called because he could not get in to the vehicle, which he would have obviously been able to do if the window was down. To this, the mechanic replied that there must have been a \""""miscommunication\"""" because the window was down when it had been towed in. I asked him why then had the other mechanic not been able to get into a vehicle with an open window, to which he stammered \""""uhh, umm, he never actually went out to the vehicle, and umm, never noticed the window was open.\"""" I asked him how he knew that the key didn't work if he didn't go out to the vehicle, to which he said that \""""well....uhh... he did go out, but didn't notice the window was down.\"""" I almost fell off my chair, \""""who do you have working for you?\"""" I asked incredulously. It didn't matter, the mechanic was holding to his story, and I could either pay to fix the window that they OBVIOUSLY broke when trying to get in to the vehicle, or spend a bunch of time arguing and fighting it. I decided to not give them the satisfaction (and extra money)  and had it repaired at another place. I have since complained to AAA and the BBB. Stay away!"""""""

<review>"""We had such high hopes.\n\nCafe Zuzu was a huge disappointment today.  The decor was the best part of the meal.  From a lethargic, disinterested waitress to a kitchen staff that required 45 minutes to serve undercooked food to the only table waiting for service in the restaurant, it was just a sad experience for our family.  After waiting 40 minutes, we approached the hostess for help with where our food might be.  Why the hostess?  Because our waitress had become completely invisible.  We looked but could not find her.  \n\nWhen the food did arrive, it came in spurts.  With three people serving, you'd think they could get all the food out at once.  Alas, they could not.  We all had to wait another 10 minutes until the entire party was served. \n\nNow for the food.  We ordered burgers, a sliced turkey dinner and some chicken fingers.  The burgers were the best of the lot, made with an excellent quality beef patty, delicious cheese and a tender bun.  The sliced turkey was god-awful horrid.  It clearly wasn't carved from anything resembling a real bird, but was some type of formed meat buried under a half cup of salty canned gravy.  An assortment of fresh steamed vegetables were the best thing on that plate.\n\nA side serving of mashed potatoes was another miss.  Clearly reconstituted, the potatoes were tasteless and without proper texture.  I've had better when visiting Grandma in the nursing home.\n\nThe organic greens salad was excellent; not so for the torn iceberg salads which could have been made by a three year old.  The onion rings were greasy but good.  The wonderful salted dinner rolls were the hit of the night.  next time I visit Zuzu I may just buy a basket of bread.\n\nNow for the final insult, for some reason, our waitress served us room temperature water without ice.  Who does this?  Why?\n\nThe management tried to make apologies for the kitchen, and we would accept them, if it weren't obvious that the problems with the food and service were not limited to our table.  \n\nWhoever is the manager of Cafe Zuzu, please take note:  you can do so much better.  We came for the wedge salad and great burgers and got \torn\"""" iceberg (it was clearly chopped) and undercooked burgers that arrived cold.  Please, talk to your staff.  They're going to put you out of business if they keep performing like this when you're not in the building.\n\nHope you do better for us next time."""""""

<review>So, shame on me for not taking the reviews of this place seriously and actually suggesting it for lunch today.  It happens to be in a convenient location (in chain restaurant hell off of Stapley and the 60) and we've had drinks there a couple of times.  It's really a pretty restaurant inside....too bad the food doesn't live up to the atmosphere.  They've been advertising $5.99 lunch specials via their email list, so I thought it might be worth a try.  \n\nThe large  menu seems fairly impressive and includes fresh seafood, fried specialties, pasta, salads and a long list of sandwiches and wraps.  We opted to share the Calamari Salad and the fried  Alaskan Cod/Shrimp/Chicken lunch.  We should have been forewarned when the food suddenly appears within five minutes of ordering.  To put it nicely, the salad just plain sucked.  The menu describes it as a Greek salad....NOT.  Wilted romaine lettuce tossed with some sort of sickeningly sweet poppyseed dressing (WTH?) and a few pieces of calamari on top.  I will say, however, that the tender, non-greasy pieces of calamari are the reason why I'm NOT giving this place one star.  The fried platter was OK...she ate the fish and I ate the shrimp and chicken.  The fries weren't bad...just nothing to write home about and the cole slaw was barely passable.    \n\nThe service wasn't much better than two stars as well....I mean just because we're drinking H2O with lemon and not having cocktails doesn't mean you can ignore our need for refills. On our last visit we sat at the bar and ordered martinis...I guess that doesn't count.\n\nAnyway, we didn't pay for the salad (thank God) and I left starving..it really wasn't even the equivalent of sharing two appetizers since the portions are small to begin with and we weren't inclined to finish either dish.  I'm embarressed to say it, but I'm sure Red Lobster would have been a better option, or, even Long John Silvers for that matter :(

<review>"""I booked my birthday party here, mostly because of it's close proximity to The Duce. I was in contact with someone who said she was the Manager, Daron Harvey. She was great and said she would extend happy hour for my party. However, upon arrival, the night of my party, the manager on duty had no idea my party was coming. When I told him that I had spoken to a manager about having my party there and he snidely remarked, \that's weird, I'm the manager.\"""" Wow, way to be nice about the amount of business I am about to bring your bar. To top it off, we got there at 9pm, which is what I told the Manager I was e-mailing, just to find out they normally close at 10pm on non-Suns game nights, unless they have 20+ people. So, now I feel awkward 'cause we're keeping these servers past the time that they probably thought they were going home. \n\nThe only reason I am not giving them one star is that they were still able to accommodate my party and give us the specials. Except after 1.5 hours of being there, the server asks me if we're all on separate checks. I don't understand how you just assume these things and we had to wait a bit longer to get our tabs. Lastly, I get the rule to add gratuity for such a big party, but the gratuity added was 22%. Random. \n\nSuch a terrible experience."""""""
</review>
<review>Totally forgot to Yelp about the fat chick behind the bar that apparently is pretty bitter about not being let on stage. Opened up a tab (She also required my ID) and when I went back for round two she didn't remember me and had lost my credit card and my driver's license. Obviously not wanting to be wrong she calls over her trusty meathead who kicks me out of the club without discussion. So I stand outside refusing to leave until I get my stuff back and eventually a bouncer comes out, doesn't apologize, and hands me my cards. I realize these people deal with scumbags all the time but I had barely finished my first drink before they booted me out for demanding that someone return to me what was mine. I'll probably go back but I'll definitely need to bring some Taco Bell in a horse feed bag to bribe/distract that thing behind the bar while I enjoy my night.

<review>One star for service.  3.5 for food.\n\nDear Revo, When a business orders lunch to be ready at a specific time, and well in advance, MAKE THE DAMN FOOD AND MAKE IT READY WHEN YOU SAY YOU WILL.\n\nSorry for yelling.  Had to vent.  They have done this to me 3 times now where we order at 11 for an 11:45 pickup only to have the person picking up wait 20 minutes.  You've lost our office's lunch business.\n\nThis is a shame because the food is quite good.  Even if you eat in they are very slow though.\n\nSO, if you have an hour or two for lunch, give it a try.  Everything I have had is good.  Solid green chili and carne asada.  Real stand out is the creamy rice that comes with the combos, YUM!

<review>Disappointing to say the least....\nThis is my 4th time here and I wouldn;t have gone here so many times if it wasn't the proximity to MCC. Each and everytime I have been rather dissapointed with teh level of service which has been slow and blase at the best of times.\n This time around I had to wait 20 miniutes at teh sushi bar (after my order) before teh chef showed up. By then I had lost interest in suchi and Saketini as a whole. I would understand if this place was crowded but there were only 2 other groups and that too none of them were at the bar.\n\nNote to self: Never venture here again
</review>
<review>to start with i went with my boyfriend at 330 on 9/10/11. there were only 5 tables of people there including us. after sitting down i realized the cushion was covered in chip crumbs and lettuce, clearly they had not been wiped off. after ordering the server Joe D didnt ask if i needed a straw or lemon for my water. then my boyfriend had to wait 10 minutes to get a refill on his pepsi. when i looked around i saw Joe D standing at the bar slurping from his drink while talking to the guy behind the bar. The table next to me were served burnt chips. when we got the food my chicken was dry. this place sucks! i had been there before about 10 years ago and it was great back then. lastly this company has no comment cards anywhere in the restaurant nor do they have a way to contact the restaurant or make complaints through the website. they must not care about their customers as much as they use to. i do not recommend. if you are looking for mexican there are better places in the central/biltmore area. the only good thing was the red sauce on the chimi but not enough to get me back.

<review>"""Went here for a quick bite with family before a play at Phoenix Theater.  I was hesitant based on the reviews here about cleanliness and mediocre food, but the place is a local legend and we had to give it a try.  On the way to our booth, we passed a large empty table that still had the messy remains of previous diners and wondered why the not-busy-at-all waitstaff hadn't cleaned it up yet. The food was on the high side of \just OK.\""""  The malt, ice-cream soda, and phosphates we ordered with dinner were fantastic.  But, before the final curtain of the show, the cramping began for what would be a 24-hour bout of food poisoning traced back - by process of elimination - to McAlpines chicken salad.  I suppose if you want a delicious soda fountain treat, this is your place.  If you want to eat diner food without getting sick, go somewhere else."""""""

<review>The ID I provided to the TSA was STILL not enough to get a drink here. We would have stayed, but their prices are ridiculous, so we walked up to FOX. They were far busier and it is obviously for a reason. They happily accepted my ID here and we ate and drank our way through a rather long layover.\n\n\nThis place stinks, even for an airport bar. Avoid at all possible costs. Only gave 1 star because I had to.
</review>
<review>I don't mind riding the bus with crazy people and grumpy unfriendly drivers. What I do mind is the price being too high and the lack of service at. night and on the weekends. I can't afford to go anywhere. I can only afford to go to school one day a week. Even then I still have to walk a mile to the school and a mile from the school because I can't afford the all day pass. How am supposed to get on my feet if I can't even afford to take the bus to go job hunting. And now you want to raise the price another dollar? WTF!
</review>
<review>This was my first visit to this new location of OSF in the chandler mall, and I'll tell you right now, I don't know if the other locations are this bad, but I will not be returning... If you're wondering why, read on, you'll see.\n\n\n---Service---\nWe had a table of 10, which i understand can be difficult, but in a restaurant this big that seats probably 150 people or so, they shouldn't have trouble with a table of 10. We were seated promptly enough, and our waitress took drink orders while we were still waiting for half of our crew. Once everyone else showed up she took their orders, but completely forgot my friend. He eventually got a water, but by that time we were about half way done with our meal. When the food that we ordered arrived, my friend who didn't get a drink also didn't get his entr\u00e9e. It came out about 5 minutes after everyone elses. My wife and I ordered garlic cheese bread as an appetizer and we didn't get it until 10 minutes after we were done eating dinner. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, which I don't buy at all. She simply forgot to place the order until i mentioned it was missing, plain and simple. When the bill came we noticed that the two drinks we ordered were missing from the tab and we notified the waitress of her mistake. What she should have done was apologize for the poor service and numerous mistakes she made and comp'd the drinks and the garlic bread, but instead she corrected her mistake and she threw away an opportunity win some brownies points and any kind of a reasonable tip. Sadly, this had to be some of the worst service I've received at a restaurant in recent history.\n\n\n---Atmosphere----\nAs far as the restaurant itself is concerned, they did a really good job converting a rather eclectic Mexican place into a nicely furnished and modern feeling Italian joint. Our party was seated closer to the front of the restaurant, and because they left the outer doors of the two doored entry way wide open, whenever anybody would come inside there was a giant gush of cold air that would sweep in, making everyone at my table cold while trying to enjoy out no-longer-hot food. What's the point of having two entry doors if you leave the outside doors wide open!! Seriously people. It was pretty noisy and chaotic inside as well. All the waiters and waitresses seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The nature of the building also lends itself to being acoustically boisterous, that is to say, this isn't the place to come if you're in the mood for a quiet dinner with your loved one. \n\n\n----Quality----\nNone of this even speaks to the quality of the food, which is to say, quite sub par considering the prices on the menu. My wife and I ordered the whole wheat spaghetti with mushrooms and marinara sauce. The portion size was smaller than average for a $10 plate, and the sauce was way to wet and there was way to much of it. My spaghetti was drowning in a thin red soup. I've made better at home! My brother in law ordered the chicken parm and his meal was just as bland and boring. The serving of spaghetti he got was tiny, and the chicken breast wasn't even breaded, which may be healthier for you, but it's not chicken parm unless that chicken is deep fried and crispy. The salad we got before the meal was sub standard by any means, low quality ice berg with a few tiny croutons. The creamy pesto sauce that came with it was good, but not so good that it warrants drowning your lettuce in it (which is was). The cheesy garlic bread that we received ten minutes too late was actually pretty decent although a bit greasy for my taste. The sourdough bread was fresh and warm, however, don't expect to get a fresh loaf if the kitchen is out of knives, apparently they won't bring you one unless they have a fresh knife to give you as well. The ice cream we got after the meal was decent enough, I enjoyed the flavor of the spumoni, however, there were ice crystals in it, which leads me to conclude the ice cream tub had been left out and refrozen after a while, ruining the smooth texture it should have. There's no excuse for that. \n\n\n---Summary----\nI don't give out 1 star reviews very often, as I'm usually easier to please, but last night it seemed like it was consistently one thing after another that just piled on top of each other. Eating here made me long for olive garden, which at the very least is quieter and as far as I can tell, has much better food. I can only imagine what the lease is costing them for that location, and I'm sad to say it, but I actually hope they go out of business to save anyone else from the experience of dining there. Maybe they can turn things around, maybe they can't. From the other reviews I've seen so far, it appears as though they're making a habit of pissing off their customers. So there's nothing left to say but good riddance, I hope whoever takes over that space next actually puts some thought into how to run a restaurant.

Not so much!  \n\nOK, my massage therapist was very good so no complaints there.  But this spa place is so cheesy!  And I'm not talking about delicious well-aged Gouda.  I'm talking pure VELVETTA.  I swear the interior decorator went to TJ Maxx and purchased the lanterns, candles, crystals and other decor that is suppose to make guests feel as if they were in the Andulasian region of Spain or in Morocco.

<review>After several good meals at FnB, last nights experience came up very short.  We had a 6:45 reservation and when we made the reservation were told that the next reservation for the table was at 9:00 so we would need to be finished by then.  The waiter was terrific but the food came up very short.  The food was piled in in small plates and looked very unappetizing.  While the fried green tomatoes were good there were smothered in a sauce and covered with a large handful of greens.  The waiter went to great lengths to describe the special orange appetizer with various exotic spices.  It looked and tasted like orange slices with some kind of cheese.  The ribeye looked unappetizing and was very tough.  The pink grouper was piled on a small plate with cauliflower, broccoli and confusing spices - smelled fishy and was undercooked.\n\nAt 8:40 we had paid and were finishing up a conversation when the hostess very rudely informed us that we had to leave as the next reservation had arrived, apparently 20 minutes early.\n\nAll in all an expensive and very unsatisfactory evening.  They seemed more interested in turning the tables than providing a pleasant dining experience.
</review>
<review>We used to order from NYPD quite often, but this place has gone straight downhill in the last few years.\n\nWe called for pick-up tonight and were put on hold. No problem, it's dinnertime and they're busy. Someone comes on the line and asks if we're ordering pickup or delivery. We tell them... and get put on hold again. Okay.\n\nThe guy taking our order seemed totally clueless - probably another new high schooler they hired. He required long pauses between each item of our huge order of 3 dishes and 2 sides. Not terribly difficult, we thought.\n\nWhen we arrived, they tried to tell us that the olive oil that goes on their pasta is plain. Um, seriously? I'm paying for plain olive oil on my plain pasta? I can do that myself! I know for a fact they usually season their olive oil, as do ALL decent Italian restaurants. The fact that I had to argue with them about it was ridiculous. We had to ASK for some garlic and seasoning to be mixed in for us. Thanks.\n\nNext, we specifically ordered garlic CHEESE knots - confirmed two times over the phone - only to arrive home and discover we had plain garlic knots. If we'd known, we would've saved the money and just had the ones that came with the entrees. Most upsetting was the fact that we were, indeed, charged for the CHEESE knots, not the plain ones. How complex IS this?\n\nFinally, we had to actually request a side of sauce for our cheesecake, when this was never explained over the phone. Funny, since the website menu specifically states the dessert comes with raspberry topping. If there were options, maybe we should have been informed when ordering. If we hadn't caught the mistake, we would've left with... a slice of plain cheesecake. Fantastic. For nearly 5 bucks? I can get two slices for half that at Walmart, strawberry swirl included.\n\nAll this for overpriced, bland food, an enormous wait time, an incompetent staff, and one huge headache. The pizza is good, sure, but the hassle is NOT worth it anymore. If this is how they run the show now, then I'll take my business somewhere tastier and cheaper.

<review>Went for lunch recently because Verde was overflowing. Cool place- liked the atmosphere and there's a lot of room. Saw a DJ set up in the corner- I bet that's for their late night service which I would be willing to check out. As far as food, there is a small selection and it's all about $9/10 a plate. Asked for a vegetable substitution but the chef refused (in a way I can respect that he protects his food, but I might have liked it better if he had just obliged me). Service was friendly, but slow. I'm not saying Sens is bad- just that I've had better.

<review>Not sure what ladies the other raters were working with but the one that was there when I went in was borderline hostile towards me.  She reluctantly offered to help me and then gave me repeated dirty looks as I browsed through the store.   I mentioned having problems breastfeeding and she just stared at me then walked away.  Come to find out later they have classes and a lactation consultant.  Never were either of these things mentioned while I was there which I find weird, wouldn't one want to advertise these services?  Isn't making money the object of owning a business?\nI was put off by her crap attitude and the elitist feel of the store.  Pretty much everything she had could be found other places for about half to 70% less money.  Tea for 14 dollars?  Yeah. I found that same tea for 4 dollars elsewhere.  I guess it's tough for me to believe that any normal person would want a duponi silk baby sling for an annoyingly high price.  Anyone who does breastfeed knows that milk pretty much as a way of getting everywhere, even silk baby slings.  \nNot sure, maybe it was an off day for them but I would not recommend them to anyone if that is how they treat customers.  I guess I would recommend them if you like to be pretentious and spend way too much on stuff just because you can.  There are people like that in Scottsdale and this would be the place for them.

<review>For a restaurant that supposedly prides itself on its five star service I was very disappointed. First off the waitress looked completely disheveled, messy hair too small faded black shirt and cheap looking black pants. Then when we placed out order for the mussels we were advised by her that they are very fishy this time of year. My husband had never tried them so we took a chance. We also ordered the Kobe beef sliders and the tomato salad. The Kobe sliders were so well done you could call them burnt, the salad was tiny with wilted lettuce and the mussels(surprisingly) were good. By the time we saw our waitress again we were finished with our meal. I asked her about the Kobe sliders and commented that they are always prepared well done and she quickly brushed off my comment and walked off.So much for the customer is always right. Needless to say my husband and I were very disappointed to spend a hefty amount of money for so-so food and terrible service. Needless to say we will not go to Different Pointe of View again and will NOT recommend it to our family and friends.

<review>Eh. I've had better. Their boba was.....how do I explain? ....it was like, falling apart. They weren't that firm, the texture was just gross (and yes, I've had boba before....) Also, there wasn't a lot of ice in my drink, which also made it more gross. \n\nI think I will stick with my regular place....I like the boba at a restaurant in Mekong Plaza....I think it's called Taiwan Food Express...but I'm not sure.. It's on the North side of the Plaza and it faces the parking lot. There's a bunch of pictures of Boba Tea, ya can't miss it. (but I think I am going to give The Street a try....thanks Arlington W.)

<review>My room smelled like B.O. every time I entered. I went into the gym and it was disgustingly hot, humid, and a bit smelly (but I worked out anyway). The water pressure in the shower sucked - like having some midget pour water on you from a bucket. But this is not what compelled me to write this review - I was going to let all this slide. What irked me was when I asked the guy behind the desk to give me a 5 AM wake up call because I had an event the next morning with three local TV channels attending. No wake up call. Good thing the alarm on my cell phone works. Next time I think the Courtyard Marriott might be in order.

<review>"""Maybe it's just me but this store is not up to par in my opinion. I always stop here to get money orders for rent on the way home from work and I almost always have to wait at the counter for 5 or more minutes while employees constantly yell \someone will be right with you\"""" at me from all directions. The sandwich counter is good although it says sandwich in 3 minutes or its free and it always takes longer. (I never say anything because I don't care, I just don't see the point of the sign.) Their meat section is a joke lacking any real selection. The produce is almost always below my quality standards and is also lacking in selection. Last but most definitely not least they always have just one register open and no self checkout.

<review>"""Mill Ave was packed with local stores and had a quirky, fun college town feeling in the 1970s when we moved here. Locals (my family included) went there all the time. Then our city fathers decided to \improve\"""" Mill Ave by \""""yuppifying\"""" it and chasing out local business and pursuing national chains.

The City of Tempe also shuts down Mill Ave for events like the arts festival and for ASU games, so you really never know if you can even drive through the district. Our family avoids this area.\nThe new plan for attracting customers to Mill Ave is to spend MILLIONS for a slow motion trolly that will block/impede the right lane of Mill Ave in both directions from Southern Ave directly to and around Michael Monti's restaurant. Can you spell BOONDOGGLE???"""""""

<review>"""I would give this Capital Grille location no stars if possible. I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \corporate recipe\"""", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \""""signature\"""" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire."""""""

<review>"""The first time I went there was a great experience. It was the first place I ever ordered a dirty martini, and it was delicious. The prices were a little higher than other places, but not too bad. I think I paid around $7 for a pretty strong martini\n.\nThe 2nd time, however, made me decide I will never return. I know it's a \tequila bar\"""", but I'm not a fan of tequila. So I ordered a martini again. First, the bartender rolled her eyes at me. She started the drink with their \""""well\"""" vodka but, when that bottle emptied, switched to Skyy. After she hands me the drink and prints out the receipt for me to sign, she tells me they didn't have very much olive juice. I figured it would be fine, the dry vermouth should cut the flavor of the vodka enough. Then I noticed she charged me the price it would be for a skyy martini...I paid $10 for what basically turned out to be a glass of vodka with a couple olives in it. If I want straight vodka, I'll order it.\n\nI ended up going to another bartender and asking her to put a mixer in it, which she did with no problem.\n\nIn all of this, my friend had to wait 15 minutes before getting a drink (he was standing right at the bar). My boyfriend had to wait 20, and I even went and stood near him, leaning over the bar showing off cleavage, thinking maybe that would get me service quicker so I could just order his drink for him. Nope, still nothing. \n\nTried waving over bartenders multiple times, but they just kept going over to large groups of people who got there after us. We finally gave up on his drink.\n\nOn top of all of that, the boys had to pay a cover, which that place really shouldn't charge. I like Suite 301 far better, and I've never paid a cover there.\n\nMaybe that was just a one-time thing, maybe we just had a couple bad bartenders, who knows. But I didn't think they were anything special, even when I did have a good experience, so I see no point in returning, nor will I recommend it."""""""

<review>"""I made my second visit to this place over the weekend and kept saying to myself, \why the f*ck am I here again?\""""  I guess this place appeals to certain types of people who like to overpay for \""""groceries\"""" and fight for parking, but it just isn't my style.  Sure, if you live in the immediate area and find that AJ's or Whole Foods has shut down then yes, going to Oakville Grocery may fill the void temporarily.  However, if you don't live within walking distance then the place is just stupid.  \n\nOn the plus side, they do have a decent selection of good looking pre-made dishes and some different wines, breads, olive oils, etc.  Their staff is also very helpful and friendly.  They also have wine and food samples from time to time.\n\nBoth times I visited I was fortunately not there to shop, but to get a sandwich from their deli thing.  Both times I ordered different things and both times I cannot remember what I had because the sandwiches were just blah.  Bland and blah.  Not a fan."""""""

<review>The only reason I give this store 2 stars is because I have yet to find lower prices on groceries.\nOther than that, everything about this store annoys me. From the complaining checkers, the 3 girls that are busy sharing facebook photos and talking about dates while attempting to check me out, the terrible produce selection (I now buy all my produce at Sprouts)... ugh. My biggest complaint is how my groceries are bagged. I admit, I can be a tad ocd about things but when I unload my groceries and find soap with my eggs, it is incredibly annnoying. This store also employs 3 or 4 people with handicaps, which is fine other than when I come through with $150 worth of groceries, I expect them to come home with me in the same manner I picked them from the shelves...unharmed. I always try to avoid those lines. There is one guy that talks the entire time instead of bagging and then people behind me have to wait longer because he's so slow. I know that might sound mean but if an employee (whether handicapped or not) can't keep up, move to a line with less groceries. I don't spend $500/mo at this store to hang out and be patient with their mostly inadequate employees. I was so angry when I got home the other week, I actually took $50 worth of groceries back to make my point. Not surprising though, they don't really give a crap. Maybe it's the manager change, I'm not sure.\nLike I said before, the only reason I don't go elsewhere is because I cannot afford the other stores. But hmmm... now that I think about it, it might be worth it to pay $20/mor a week to save me the hassle of dealing with this store.
</review>
<review>I think ownership of this place has changed hands in the last few years... I've eaten here in the past and the results were unremarkable. Back then, the staff seemed to be East Coast impatient and the food was simply average. Deli seemed to be an afterthought. \n\nIt doesn't look like much has changed... It's little more than a neighborhood quick-e-mart. It's family owned I think, but the owner was a bit bristly with me when I was in there recently. \n\nI think this place could pile up bags of garbage in one of the aisles and people would still come here - there's nothing else close by for people in the neighborhood except for the grocery store on 48th. Give the people no choice, and they will choose you regardless. \n\nI lived in the neighborhood for 10 years and only went here a few times... every visit made me remember why I didn't want to come back. I can't see people going out of their way to eat here. \n\nThe Valley is lacking in decent Deli's - unfortunately, this one doesn't qualify. I've always wanted this to be a little hidden gem, but it's simply not special.

<review>I have had similar issues like Jenny R. and Sara B. I am enrolling into CGCC Fall 2011 and I was a MCC student last year so I assumed everything would be updated across both schools, which is how they make it seem. CGCC was charging me out of county/state tuition, so I called and was put on hold for 15 mins, I was told that my account would be updated. Class started a few days later and I was able to log in with no issues. When I logged in on day two, I found out my class was dropped. So I spent another 13 mins on hold trying to resolve this issue, the rep said she watched her coworker update my file with the correct in county/state tuition. I am now showing as enrolled, but it is going to take up to 72 hours before I can access the online course through blackboard. I am so tired of people that cannot do their job. If the second rep could put me on hold for 5 mins to resolve this issue, why did I have to go through this at all?? I am going to take my class and hope December comes fast. Luckily I have completed my undergrad degree and I am just taking a course to help with my job skills. Good luck to the other students that are just starting.
</review>
<review>I don't get why everyone loves this restaurant. Maybe the drinks are strong for a reason??? The food is ordinary, although reasonably priced. However, I have been to the restaurant twice and both times had shoddy service. The first time, the restaurant was extremely busy, so I could understand. The last time I was there with 4 colleagues for lunch. Two of us shared entrees. Two of my friends discussed with each other that they would also order a salad and share it, but asked the server not to split the salad, as there is a $5 fee for doing so, and they didn't need two plates. Instead the server did split the salad, so they were charged $10 for splitting both the entree and the salad. Then we found a hair in the hamburger we had split after almost eating all of it. By that time, the server was so slow, that we had run out of time for deserrt, had to return to work, and didn't even have time to discuss the hair in our food. It took forever for the server to come and pick up the payment for our check, so I took it up to the bartender, explaining that we were late getting to work and wanted to take care of it. I was rebuffed, and told that the server had to take it. He did not try to help me locate the server, so I waited some more. I will not return to this restaurant again.

<review>"""My senior prom was held here some years ago and - much like the amalgammation of events that led up to my high school graduation - the Arizona Center still makes me feel socially awkward, unwanted, and uncomfortable.\n\nI don't even know the names of kitschy tourist shops here, but they definitely boast \I'll Give up Breathing Before I Give Up Beer\"""" shirts in their window displays. Ugh, really? Yeah, I so want to advertise to all the crackheads and hobos on Van Buren that I'm 100% tore up in the middle of the day. Maybe I will buy some Kachina bobbleheads and flower-printed cardstock and call it a day. Not before I stop at Hooters on my lunch break, of course.\n\nI wish this place retained some of its former charm, or at least a viable destination for my too-short weekday lunches. Unfortunately it's chock full of douchebag midday Mill-rejects who jaywalk across Van Buren just to stop in the middle of a high-traffic area and look around stupidly for the best chain bar. And not that I bother with the upper level (what the hell is even up there? anything?), but has anyone noticed the broke-ass escalator that has been chained off for two years? Am I making this up? This place really can't be that bad, right?\n\nThe movie theater is decent if you're comparing it to the massacred, always full of the guy that thinks obvious foreshadowing in movies is  a profound revelation environment at the AZ Mills Harkins, but my only faint recollection of this place was watching the ATHF movie here while day-drunk, passing out a quarter of the way through. Maybe I shouldn't advertise that here. At least no one kicked me out, which is a plus, because I snore.\n\nThis place is way more fun at night when you're 17 and no one likes you. Unless you're one of the bizarre downtown tourists that takes \""""art\"""" photos of dirty alleys and family portraits in front of the Subway, you probably have somewhere better to be."""""""

<review>"""The giant horse scared me! I thought it was a real stuffed horse at first glance.\n\nOn a nice summer night, we weren't able to get a seat outside because there was a graduation party going on. Instead we sat inside and listened to the Michael Buble-ish croonster and his homeless sidekick. I'm not sure if he was homeless but he was rocking on the bass guitar and would add in his \oh yeahs\"""" and \""""uh huhs\"""" during an intense jam session. It was creepy and cute.\n\nMy friend bought the table a round of marachino cherries that are laced with vodka and cinnamon rum. It was interesting but way too strong for my tastes.\n\nI started with an Oak Creek Hefe which was warm so the server brought me frosty mug but that didn't help either. I ordered the Spicy Cajun Sausage appetizer and it was nothing more than a bowl of sliced sausage links floating in a cold hot sauce. It was disgusting. I had to ask the server if the appetizer was meant to be cold. I'm just not a fan of cold sausage. The best part of my meal was the sourdough bread- and it was damn good because I was starving!\n\nOh yeah- the bathroom was pretty scary.

<review>I have been to this place a few times because friends were already there and talked me into meeting them there. I have never really thought much of the food but it was not bad enough to write a review about. How bad can you mess up mexican food? But recently I dined at Julio G's and the experience was enough to inspire me to share.  First of all the decor has always bothered me there.  Pink Neon reminds me of some 50's diner.   I always expect to see a Milk Shake on the Menu when I sit down.  Also on this must recent visit I had really poor service. It was only slightly busy but it took an inordinate about of time to get a simple combo dish out.  \n\nThey thing that stuck me most about Julio G's was how expensive it was.  Nothing on the menu was less then $11 for a combo dish.  Actually I think a 2 item combo was like $10.95 and a 3 Item was like $11.95.  Man, $12 bucks for some marginal Mexican Food? I realize prices have gone up on food and produce.  I am sort of expecting to see some price increases across the board at some of my favorite spots.  But this was what I consider to be way out of line with the quality of food, service and overall dining experience.
</review>
<review>I came in expecting allot but it just didn't live up to what I thought the flavors would be with a name like Bombay Spice. The prices on the wine are great but the menu is a bit confusing and the food has potential but it needs allot of work. I'm a big fan of Indian culture and food but it's not terrible but there is other places that have great Indian food that I would rather go. overall I give it about a 2.3..... Save your time and money this place is not worth the trip.
</review>
<review>This was a terrible experience.  You can not reach anyone via phone, you have to book online, which I did and also requested a phone call.  I rcvd no call and had an email in my email confirming a time for cleaning.  I requested a call then and got a reply stating someone would call me in 15 mins.  Still no call.  The cleaners arrived  and  I had someone let them in.  When I returned they were to clean the bathrooms  and  they were TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!  The sinks were dirty, with tooth paste splatters on sink, the inside of the shower had brown marks from some sort of un rinsed product.  I am so unhappy about this.  I have tried to reach them every day since  and  have not recieved a call back from a voice mail or email.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE AWEFUL!
</review>
<review>I'm probably a little biased in this review because of the fact that I can't stand disorganized stores. There are about 5 long aisles of merchandise in the store and it is almost completely random of what you will find (and where you will find it). From my understanding, unknown items come in each week with very good deals. The catch is that you have to be willing to maneuver your way through the mess to get to them... almost like a second-hand store. Not my thing. \n\nI'm willing to pay a few more dollars for an item to go into a store and find it located neatly in its place; a place that I know where it is; a place that I know I will find it. (i.e. you need sheets? You know that you can go to target and they're going to have a good selection of brands, styles, and colors... and you know what section of the store you'll find them in... and they're sorted on the shelves in an order that you can quickly find the size you need).
</review>
<review>Reviews for this place are really misleading.  We went there today, and we were very disappointed.  If you're looking for more authentic Indian food,  this is not the place.  We noticed that the chicken tikka was sweeter than usual, when we asked the chef if it had ketchup or bbq sauce, he mentioned that they did use some ketchup.  \n\nWe ordered 3 other dishes, biryani, lamb chili, and chicken karahi.  The biryani was not fresh - the chicken was sub-par, the lamb chili was OK - a little bland, and the chicken karahi was relatively the better dish of the night.  Again, there was only one other table that was occupied, so maybe they weren't prepared?\n\nWe went there because we were at an event where they catered food from there, and that catered food was much better than what we had at the restaurant.   \n\nNot going back there.

<review>Wow... Another Casualty of our Times\n\nI was just at the cool clothing store Status on New Years eve to buy Hubby a cute couple of things that he might like to wear that evening to our New Years Dinner.  One Rock and Republic pair of jeans and 2 awesome rocker-type button up shirts.  He wore the shirt out to dinner but the pants were a little too tight.\n\nWent there yesterday to see if we could exchange them for him - and like a thief in the night, the Status clothing store was gone.  The only thing that would tell you it was there was the awning.  \n\nWhat irks me more is that I was there only 8 days ago and spoke to the general manager guy about his selection of clothing.  He did not ever mention they were going out of business or moving - and he knew I was buying this for my husband.  I would probably not have bought the jeans for him had i known I couldnt exchange them.\n\nThe rest of City North is just depressing as well.  Ocean Club is still anchoring it.  Food there is good but really more expensive than necessary.  \n\nA real shame about CityNorth.  I thought it was going to be great...

All portions were very small. \n\nOver priced!\n\nService - There were only two other parties. The chefs visited those tables, but not mine.

The \""""naan bread\"""" was a tortilla and the tikka masala was out of a can (not very flavorful).

<review>Hire a busboy! I had to say it. I had to take these pictures. This is my _third_ visit since my May update with the same result and I can't keep it to myself any longer. The staff neglects the dining room. Period. Dot. Patrons often have to move dirty plates, stacking them up on top of trays at another table, just to sit down.\n\nMy recommendation to the owners is to put up some garbage bins like all other self-busing fast-food places and make _us_ do it if you're not going to.\n\nI have to wonder what happens to all those half-filled salsa squirt bottles left on the tables unrefrigerated for so long. Do they top off and return them to service, or are they emptied and washed before refilling?\n\nIt is my sincere hope that very soon I will be able to update this review again and say that things are back to normal. Until then, I have to advise driving a bit further south to Mi Patio, or north to Sylvia's La Canasta.

<review>"""I was hungry for a slice and my favorite place in old town was closed.  So, we'd been meaning to try Nello's anyway so we went in.  \n\nWe ordered the 14\ Numero Uno, which is homemade sausage with mushrooms, pan crust.  It looked great and it smelled great, and it had a great cheese coating, so imagine my surprise when I bite into it and find that its very bland.  The crust was good.  I can taste the cheese..  I tried putting a ton of red pepper flakes on top and then parmegan cheese, but it didn't help much at all.  \n\nVery interesting.  I kept eating it trying to figure out the problem.  I've had mushroom on pizza before by itself and it didn't taste like this.  The crust is ok, not undercooked although it kind of tastes similar to undercooked dough.

<review>If anyone thinks this place is authentic... I wonder what they consider Taco Bell to be? Heaven? I had the bland Chicken Burro which was very disappointing. Then I also had 2 Tamales with Rice and Beans. My friend had 2 Cheese Enchilada plate. When we opened them, we couldn't tell the difference. They were both swimming in the same canned sauce. The only way to tell the difference was finding the maize from a Tamale. As for the rice, I never knew Spanish Rice was supposed to be crunchy and undercooked.... Just over all a let down. AZ should open the border back up and get real food here. If you are a true foodie, don't bother with this place.

<review>"""My friend celebrated her birthday here yesterday evening. We were the first three of about 15 people to show up. The server was really inconsistent and scatterbrained. As soon as we were seated, she asked us if we were ready to order drinks. After telling her we needed some time, she came back two minutes later to ask again. We asked for a HH menu and she came back several minutes later with one. Errrr.. OK, I guess the 3 of us can share... not that big of a deal I suppose. \n\n10 minutes later, she came back and we ordered our drinks and appetizers. While waiting for our orders, more people started to trickle in. By the time she came back to our table, there were about 10+ people passing around 1 happy hour menu. Either that was the only copy in the whole restaurant or she didn't want us to order from it because as soon as someone set it down, she snatched it up and took off w/ it. WTH!? \n\nWhile everyone was laughing about it and asking \did that really just happen?!\"""" our food arrived. My friend  and  I shared the pork belly cubano and chicken fingers. Both were OK, but they should have just named the pork belly cubano a ham cubano because the piece of pork belly was no larger than 2 fingers. A total disappointment because I was looking forward to the pork belly the most! As for our drinks, she was OK if we flagged her down to take our (alcoholic) drink orders, but she was really scatterbrained when it came to refilling our waters! I asked several times for a refill, but she would walk away after refilling other people's half full glasses and ignore my completely empty glass. She did this to a few other people too that asked for water.\n\nThere were a few other servers that were helping her out w/ our table. When they brought out the orders, they would just drop off the plates wherever they felt like. Sometimes they would drop it off at one end of the table, sometimes in the middle, sometimes at the other end. Never once did they ask who it belonged to. When one dish was brought to my friend, she gave him a puzzled look and he started to walk away. She said \""""I guess I can figure out who this belongs to..\"""" and he came back and said \""""well I guess I can do it if you don't want to...\"""" WTF. Isn't it his JOB to?!? \n\nMy friend said she had a very similar experience last time too. Needless to say, I won't be back. Such a shame since I work right across the street and my co-workers and I eat out almost everyday."""""""

<review>I went there the other night for dinner.  Granted, I was there early but other than two people sitting talking in the restaurant, there was nobody there.   I ordered a Chicken Arepa, Shredded Beef Empanada, and the Ground Beef Pastelito.   The kid who took my order behind the counter said it would take 15 to 20 minutes.  I couldn't figure out why it would take so long-maybe they had a lot of take out orders for pizza (they share the same kitchen with Rosati's).  Instead of taking 15 to 20 minutes, I'm waiting there around 30 minutes, the kid has disappeared, and once in awhile, I see some other guys in the back.  They must know I am waiting, but not once does anyone come out and tell me that my order will be out shortly.  Finally, some other guy who looks like he could be the boss asks me what I ordered.  I tell him, and he brings out my bag, which seemed to have been sitting there for who knows how long.  It seemed hot so I left and did not complain.\n\nAs far as the food, never having had an Arepa before, I was not too impressed.  It was somewhat bland and it tasted like a taco.  The empanada was incredibly greasy.  The Pastelito was the best-the ground beef was tasty.\n\nI might go back and try some other items on their menu but they need to improve on their customer service especially when there is virtually no one in their restaurant.
</review>
<review>it has been over a year since I visited this hole of a restaurant, but my experience is what counts. The staff was confused and slow to visit our table, the pizza might be the most boring bland pizza I have ever had. The soda didn't taste right and the place was a total mess. To top it off the price was a bit high for something that can't even compete with Peter Piper. I would not go back to Grimaldi's if someone gave me a gift card. Try Prima Pizza sometime ... behind the Taco Bell on Val Vista and Baseline. It is a dive, but the pizza is simply amazing.

<review>Swanky looking place inside the W Hotel --- ooooh...ahhhhh!  Let's check out the exotic cars parked outside -- ooooooh...ahhhhh! \n\nLet's try out the food............ ..... ..... ..... ..... ..... .....\n\nPretty cool place to hangout if I wanted to be seen with cool crowd I guess (my mom said I was cool....) I didn't think their sushi and rolls were to too exciting. I guess they had to please the crowd and what's hip and cool.  The only thing exotic is parked outside, not on the menu.  Pretty basic and mediocre at best. Nothing I haven't seen. \n\nService was good overall and attentive.  Ambience is like a lounge and smooth.  I felt like I back in Hollywood Blvd hanging at Katana's. - Enjoy
</review>
<review>Food was just okay, but too pricey for what you got.  I like restaurants with the kitchen open to the dining room (Pei Wei / Arrogant Butcher) - it's fun to watch the chefs do their thing like a rehearsed dance.  What's not fun is watching the staff bicker and frustrate one another.  This made our visit more stressful than entertaining.  Wait staff was slow and not very attentive - thought about giving it another try, but it looks like this is all pretty common according to other reviews.
</review>
<review>Another jewel in the Fox crown-read amazing look and feel but outrageous prices for food that's really nothing special.  A few of us went to lunch the other day and one of my buddies orders the prime rib french dip.  The server asks if they would like mushrooms, peppers or onions to which my friend replied yes, please.  They were kind enough to charge $2 EACH for said add-ons so $6 total additional charge.  I mean seriously, I can get ten pounds of onions for two dollars...\nI ended up splitting a chicken club and a ~1 oz. cheese 'plate' with a friend and we both got iced tea.  $24...to top it off the waiter was kind of a dick.\nI probably would never patronize a Fox restaurant again if I didn't get hooked up with gift cards on occasion.

<review>This place SUCKS DOG FARTS.  After waiting two hours, I was told that I couldn't get a duplicate title because my copy of a certified financial power of attorney was not the same as a certified copy of an FPOA.  Sounds like an OXYMORON to me.  Well, if a copy is good enough for banks, why not for the MVD?  Well, because it is the gov't!  It doesn't make any sense, except that gov't workers only work to protect their jobs.  If the MVD was a business, they'd be out of business.

<review>"""Such a waste. Great little cozy Mexican restaurant for a business lunch that somehow forgot 1) how to make Mexican food and 2) how to cater to larger groups on their lunch break.\n\nYou will fall in love with its quaint, wooden interior and carafes of salsa, but the love affair will start to wain once you realize how shoddy and unorganized the service is. It's one of those serve tables by committee places where no one will claim responsibility of any table that's out there. As such, you will go through long stretches without key elements for eating your meal and either be ignored or treated rudely when you ask for help.\n\nBut the real deal-breaker for me in my one (and probably final) trip here was the food. I got a \Carne Asada Taco\"""" platter, which turned out to be a loose definition for what I got. There was a stack of four tiny, over-saturated tortillas with some carne asada on it. No guacamole, no pico, or anything else. Just some carne asada and lettuce on sticky, wet tortillas. Also came with almost tasteless beans and rice on the side.\n\nThe carne asada itself was really good and some members of my party had slightly better entrees, including the ones who got carne asada burritos which were loaded with guac and such, but we all agreed it wasn't worth the price compared to a trip to Tradiciones, La Tolteca, or even Canasta.\n\nThen we got presented with a bill that included an auto-gratuity of almost 30%. We brought it up to the woman who was running the joint for the most part and took our orders and told her to sort that out. She apologizied and said, \""""Oh, she can put on whatever gratuity she wants.\"""" \n\nSay what? Who is \""""she\""""? You are the only one running the register and taking orders. And how can any server just come up with a gratuity of 30%? Needless to say this place is trying to shakedown large business parties and should be avoided as much as possible."""""""

<review>One time I threw up in my mouth and thought that was the most disgusting taste I ever had, but then I ate at Texas Roadhouse and I can now stand corrected. Thanks goodness we had a gift card to this place, otherwise I would've paid in toilet paper. The atmosphere is pretty baller. I like the HDTVs and the woody feeling that the place has got going on. Oh, and the service is 5 stars. I've never had so many people say hi to me - I felt as popular as my facebook page. And my water was always filled, so I do appreciate that. But when it comes down to the nitty gritty, the food tasted like boo boo. I had the portabello chicken and I ate half of it. It just tasted like I was swallowing fat and grease. The cesear salad side was pretty tasty, but you aren't coming here for a salad. My girlfriend had the sirloin steak, and that was mediocre at best. I didnt think there was enough taste to the meat. I just thought our food was bland. Only go here if you have a colonoscopy scheduled the next morning - I guarantee you'll be clean to go by morning time.
</review>
<review>I guess I had more expectations of this place from seeing it on Food Network. The food was good but the service, decor and music was not good. I only gave 2 stars since I enjoyed my meal. My daughter had the pizza and I had the cheese ravioli. \nIf you want a smile from the wait staff...good luck. One was more interested in her phone and the guy was lacking all expressions. Thankfully our waitress (I think her name was Patty) was decent.\nThe decor is outdated and could use some color...its very drab and dark in here. \nThe music is rap...this is an Italian place and the music took away from the experience. I don't think I will be back again.

<review>"""Stopped by on my way to the Yelp Adopt-A-Family UYE at Metro Brasserie to pick up an oil change gift card, and I was there for half an hour. Worst service ever. If I hadn't waited until the last minute and wasn't just down the street from Metro Brasserie, I would've walked out. But I did, and I was, so I couldn't. So despite all my rage, I was - come on, you know the line - trapped like a rat in a cage. What - too 90s for you? Come on, Pumpkins rocked, admit it.\n\nAnyway, so first I stood there in the waiting room, me and the other three people waiting for their cars. There was nobody behind the register.\nI asked them, \Is there somebody working?\""""\n\""""Define working,\"""" one of them said. The others laughed.\n\nWhen the clerk finally showed up ten minutes later, he came in and started messing with the register, which I was standing in front of. \""""Hello,\"""" I said. \""""Wait,\"""" he said. I told him I just wanted a gift card. He nodded. One of the mechanics came in. Somebody's car was done. He called the guy, the guy came over.\n\nHere's their exchange:\nclerk: Your car's ready.\ncustomer: Did you rotate the tires?\nclerk: Yes. I mean no. (looks at paperwork) I don't know. (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back in). No. Do you want them rotated?\ncustomer: Yes.\nclerk: (sighs, waves customer away like he's swatting a fly)\ncustomer: I'll go ahead and pay for it, you know, since I'm standing here.\nclerk: oh, uh, I don't know if I can... (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back inside) Okay.\ncustomer: They're pulling my car out.\nclerk: What?\ncustomer: They're pulling my car out. I don't think they're not going to rotate the tires.\nclerk: do you still want the tires rotated?\ncustomer: No.\nclerk: (rings him up for oil change, no tire rotation)\n\nMy turn.\nme: \""""I'd like a gift card.\""""\nclerk: \""""How much?\""""\nme: (tell him amount) \nclerk: (stares at register for 5 minutes, every once in a while glancing over at piece of paper taped to wall)\nme: Everything okay?\nclerk: (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back inside with mechanic. Together they stare at register for another 5 minutes, then mechanic goes back outside, talks to another mechanic, comes back inside)\nmechanic: You want a gift card?\nme: Yes.\nmechanic: How much?\nme: (tell him amount)\nmechanic: (goes back outside, talks to another mechanic, comes back inside, stares at register, reads piece of paper, re-reads piece of paper, stares at register...)\nFinally they figure it out - he's got to swipe the gift card. Of course his hands are covered with grease. He hands me the card, covered in grease. Nice. Don't worry, Gabs - I cleaned it up pretty good before handing it over ;)\n\nMan, am I glad I didn't take my car here."""""""

<review>I have been here way too many times but I am officially done giving them chances. So frustrating that this place doesn't step it up! It is pretty much an overpriced bar. They have a large selection of just mediocre bar food. I love the concept and it's tons of fun for kids. But I can't bring myself to go here again because I can't bare the food. They have no healthy options on their kids menu and it's not much better on the regular menu. I consider this place a kid-friendly restaurant due to the atmosphere and concept. But the service is way too slow! The number one thing that I look for when bringing kids out to eat is fast service. It's no secret that kids have no patience for waiting 15+ minutes for a check. And happy kids equal happy customers. Crying and winy kids equal annoyed and unhappy customers. So speed it up at least please!

<review>"""Been here a couple times and really want to love it ....but just can't.  \n\nLunch this week was just okay.  Our server Jill was very enthusiastic and efficient.  For some reason this place is noisy in a very annoying way.  We endured clinking, clacking and other such kitchen/bar distractions during most of our meal.  Try having a conversation!  \n\nWe ordered meatloaf sliders w/ fries (I know, at an Asian place no less!) and pad thai.  The sliders were okay but at $11.95 not a value.  Pad thai lunch-portion was $7.95 - a bowl of noodles w/ some chicken  and  shrimp and a few onions  and  shredded carrots.  I guess next time I want \Asian\"""" I'll go all the way to a Real Chinese restaurant.\n\nOn the upside, I counted 7 different kinds of sake on the menu.  If you're a sake drinker, maybe this makes up for the so-so food?"""""""

<review>"""I used to go here when the staff were knowledgeable, nice, and the prices were just. I usually rent lenses here and get my gear here however in the past year they have slipped into what I call Wal-Martism where they are the only heavy weights around and must bow down. \n\nCame here to rent a few lenses: a 14mm canon L(they only had the mark 1) and rented as if it were a brand new just lens of the mark ii. When asked if they will ever upgrade their rental equipment they said \No, we do not give into them just upgrading the lens just so they can sell at a higher price\"""" This is false, I am no expert but the quality and technology called for the upgrade and it was a completely different lens, they felt the same about the 70-200mm. SHAME SHAME...its like comparing a point and shoot to a DSLR. \n\n2nd complaint...On the lens rental that was not upgraded I asked how much to rent for 1 week for a TSE 17mm, on the phone they said $150...wait a minute...website says $135...lady came and said...oh sorry, we need to update our website. I asked for honor and she said no. \n\n3rd. They are way over priced. Look and you will see that compared to other retailers that they are 20% marked up...its like shopping at Bestbuy...\n\nUnderstanding that they been around here along time and probably developed a strong fan base that they will attack me for this review, but lets look at them as a business and not a personal friend. They want money...you got money...enough said.\n\nOverall: Lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place. Last place to ever shop locally and time to take my dollars online.\n\nRIP Tempe Camera...until Dr. Frankenstein revives you with adjusted prices, upto date gear, and competent staff."""""""

<review>Noble Beast is a small store with limited products. They've got a ton of dog food but only a small wall of toys and a corner for bedding. If you're looking for pet food, chk out Pet Food Depot, if you're looking for dog toys/clothes/beds, chk out Petsmart. Overall, I don't recommend Noble Beast bcus I found nothing interesting and even if I did, it'd be overpriced. I would give this a half star if I could...and only bcus they have a parking lot.

<review>"""Ever go on a first date and get all starry eyed and think, \This could be it! This could be The One!\"""" and then it goes downhill from there and you can barely remember why you thought the person was so wonderful? That's my experience with Mimita's.\n\nFirst impression: Cute and clean; a good start. So many ethnic joints are plagued with decades-old spills on the carpet and dingy walls. This one, while it will win no design prize, at least got a little gussied up. I could like this, I told myself.\n\nWe started with the sampler plate, and my first bite of beef empanada was bliss. I declared, \""""I could eat ten of these!,\"""" and I should have. I should not have ingested the grease-soaked, salt-coated plantain chips. Nor should I have indulged in the deep fried yucca. Or any of the other fried bites. \n\nEver the optimist, I thought things would improve. I dug into the Cubano with reckless abandon. I really wanted this to be A Great Sandwich, but instead, I felt I could do better with my panini maker at home. The meat was chewy, the bread was insignificant and the mustard was overwhelming. Whether summing up a date or a meal, it's never a good sign when you say, \""""I can do this better by myself at home.\""""\n\nI hate to compare Mimita's to a former love, but there's no avoiding it. The ropa vieja, a favorite specialty of mine, was a letdown: Havana Cafe's is far superior.\n\nAll that said, I still would have given three stars if it weren't for how I felt later that day. A bad bout of in-di-GEST-ion crept up, with the fried sampler plate plaguing me throughout the evening. Stop calling me!, I wanted to say; I don't want to go out again! Mimita's will not get a second chance, sorry to say."""""""
</review>
<review>The service here is abysmal.\n\nAlthough the food is pretty good, though on the pricey side for  a specialty pizza (~$26), the service level experienced is beyond atrocious. \n\nOur visit occurred on a mid-week evening. Not busy at all (in fact nearly all of the non-booth center area tables were empty). We were promptly seated but then the wheels fell off. 12+ minutes waiting for our server to finally show up and ask for a drink order.  It got worse after that. Some examples: server no where to be found to refill or ask if we wanted another round; observed him chatting with friends nearby without regard or even a glance over at his few tables; clearing our plates without asking if we were even finished, rushing out the check taking it back while waiting and then taking the paid tab while we were still seated!\n\nHey Brandon or Brendan, have some class. You were rude, classless and unprofessional. \n\nThe lack of training throughout the front of house wait staff is clearly evident at this location. This was our second time at this location and the service was even worse than opening week. \n\nOutside of the service, the smallwares are exceptionally cheap. For $26 for a specialty pizza, I would expect it to be served on a decent plate with decent silverware. The stuff used here is the cheapest plastic plates and ultra thin table ware. \n\nLike I said, the pizza and other food we had is pretty good, but the service level makes sure you don't enjoy the food or the experience.

<review>I read the reviews and still ended up going to this place.. I went in for a manicure only as I thought their prices were too high for anything else. The guy who was doing my nails, did not know how to take gel polish off.  The female worker next to him had to show him how to wrap my nails in aluminum foil, and then show him how to use the tool to get the old polish off.  I should have known at that moment, my gut said run and run fast.  But I stayed to see how it would end.  I chose my color, the guy kept wiping the brush off so that he would use only the most minimal of color on my nails (not what I wanted as I have had this color before and it should look better than clear polish on my nails).  He did not coat down to the cuticle either, he left a huge gap.  When I informed him that my nails needed to stay under the light longer than 30 seconds he argued with me.  I know that they have to be under the light for a minimum of 2 minutes (experience).  And when I told him he will have to put on a 3rd coat, he called to the female (who was helping him before) to come over and talk to me.  She did, and she ended up putting on the additional coats of polish, fixing his mistakes and being frustrated with me. When I paid, the femaile did give me a card and printed on the back that I would get $5.00 off my next visit.  I don't think going back and having a discount is worth the next visit.  I will not be going here again for sure.

<review>"""This restaurant was featured in the Peoria-Glendale paper so we thought we would try it. As we walked in, we noticed the doormat said \Casa de Angelina Spanish Food.\"""" Sound interesting? If there was any Spanish food on their menu, I sure didn't see it. We were a party of 5 - 2 ordered Taco salads, 1 Chimichanga and 2 taco plates. No Spanish food there. The food we got was just OK, not up to typical Mexican restaurant standards. On the other hand, the service tonight was great. But again, the food was nothing special. We won't be back."""""""

We couldn't get any service so we tried to flag down a staff member and she just shrugged and said, \I'm not waiting on you guys\"""".

<review>Somewhere between and two and a three.  The food is not good.  There is a happy hour and a reverse happy hour.  the price points are good.  $6.00 dollar drinks, $5.00 apps.  Problem is, nothing tastes very good.  the presentation is beautiful.  the restaurant is beautiful.  there is even a live band that is pretty good (except everything sounds like dave matthews), its just that the food is made to be non-offensive.  the salad with green goddess dressing, tastes like iceberg with mayonnaise.  the fried calamari is crispy but needs some realy dipping sauce other than the same green goddess type dressing.  The char siu bao is just gross.  The burger is decent and comes with some sweet potato fries.  had some duck cubes that were just cubes of protein that looked like they were dipped in hoisin sauce.  the desserts and tiki drinks fared better.  Stick with Maitais or hot buttered rum.  All of the drinks are sweet concoctions, but they claim to have invented the Mai Tai, and the hot buttered rum comes in a fun tiki glass. the desserts however were great.  Pineapple upside down cake, Snowall (vailla icecream, coconut shavings and chocolate sauce) and bread pudding were all top notch.  Took us $60.00 bucks to get out of there for two for happy hour so it still adds up.  hit or miss, better off going to Hulas.
</review>
<review>Don't order take out. There portions are so small. I was really disappointed. My chicken was literally raw inside, the service was crap, they forgot my dressing. All I ordered was sides and a piece of grilled chicken. Simple enough...I thought. Stick to the other location till they get all there kinks worked out. \n\nThe Biltmore location is much more laid back and not nearly as trendy and wannabe hollywood.  The waitstaff is much more together and the portions are consistent. Im staying with that location.

<review>HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!\n\nThe nurse practitioner on duty was completely incompetent!  She was asking the assistant general procedure questions.  After 15 min. I picked up my baby and walked out.  How can a nurse practitioner not know how to answer general questions?   She actually guessed and then tried to verify with the assistant.  The assistant was very knowledgable and corrected her mistakes.  I left 4 messages and emails for the manager.  After 5 weeks was given a return call to tell me she had passed my messages on to the Doctor in charge.  I never received a call from him and it's now been 2 months.  This facility is horrible.  Go to PCH urgent care instead.  They are great!

<review>This was the WORST Mexican food I have ever had, by far. I would give it a minus star or two if that was possible. Had to pay $2.75 extra for a beef machaca option on my chimichanga, and I expected shredded beef with no fillers. There was huge pieces of piping hot tomato and bell pepper inside, and the meat was flavorless and watery. My wife was asked if the would like sour cream  and  guacamole with her dish (which was also not meaty and very watery). She said OK- they brought two tiny containers. We also were charged an extra $2.50, and were not informed of that. I am from California, and am almost 50 years old, so I have eaten a lot of authentic Mexican food. This was garbage in it's highest form. The place also didn't smell good, and was dirty. Amazing they have been in business this long. The prices are also very high for any restaurant, especially one with this poor quality.

<review>"""Some chicas and I were heading down to Phoenix to see a play on a Friday night, and needed a place close by the theater for some food and drinks prior (it is a play!)  I found District online and it looked promising and right across from the Herberger.  It is situated in the bottom of the Sheraton hotel, but is very large for a hotel bar/restaurant.  Online I learned they had a good looking happy hour with comfort type food and reasonable drinks - score!  They had a nice patio, so we asked the hostess if we could sit outside for happy hour, but she informed us we could not, only for dinner.  Hmmm, ok?  She said we could sit in the bar, but the bar was packed, not a seat to be had.  My friends and I joked that we could sit what looked like a rolling banquet cart - and try to find chairs.  I went to the bar to atleast get some cocktails while we hovered for a table.  I ordered 3 of the White Peach Sangria's, which were on happy hour for $3.75.  As great as they sound, they were not good.  It tasted like they had dumped the whole \can\"""" of cling peaches in the drink, because all I could taste was syrup.  We found a table and proceeded to order some food.  We shared the All American Cheeseburger, a huge burger a la carte, for only $6, the Sloppy Joe Sliders, 3 small sliders for $5 (manwich?.)  The Spiced Sweet Potato Fries, which were great at $3 and came in a little brown bag with a moroccan type yogurt sauce for dipping, and the Mac N Cheez with Beer Hots.  I loved the Mac N Cheez, but my friend wasn't crazy about the hot dogs in it.  The burger was by far the best deal, a huge burger and only $1 more than the 3 tiny little sloppy joe sliders.  We then ordered a round of Vodka/Sodas, and they didn't dissapoint.  Our total tab for 3 was around $46 before tip, so a pretty good deal.  DO get the burger and the sweet potato fries, but get a beer or a mixed drink instead of the white peach sangria."""""""

<review>If you actually look at my reviews you will find that I have reviewed many local places and given them high marks.  This place is the exception.  Walking in and the bartender was coughing into his hands and touching pizza boxes with pizzas already in them and pouring drinks and touching receipts.  Disgusting.  The pizza itself was below average.  Decent crust but very few toppings and the sauce is done in their signature way where they put round dollops of sauce every so often on the crust instead of everywhere.  I'll take everywhere.  There was nothing but crust in several spots, bland as hell, and lame.  We were grossed out by the bartender and couldn't hardly eat anyways but we actually gave it a try.  I will never spend another dime in this location.

<review>We were so excited to have another choice restaurant in North Central.  It has a great bar and patio, but I found the menu lacking.  I so wanted to love this place.  The hamburger I had was good, not great.  Did enjoy the fried okra, but found the mac and cheese dry and tasteless.   The wait staff was nonchalant and seemed to be more interested in each other than in waiting on tables.  Also, my daughter and her friends went there for a late dinner (they are all 24-26 years old).  They were carded but the waitress didn't believe them.  She sent the manager over who actually sat down at the table and had them each produce three more cards, which I thought was above and beyond.  After they had emptied their wallets, they did get their drinks, but the waitress, having been shown up, was rude to the girls after that.  It is a shame that this group of young women, who are all med students and law students, were subjected to this treatment and all have vowed never to return.

<review>Mimitas Cafe  is nothing to brag about....maybe my expectations were too high because I had a friend rave about this place so I  expected a little too much...\n\nUnfortunately I was disappointed. The food was nothing out of the ordinary..the rice was a bit dry and the flavor was bland\nThey do give fresh bread but it is very limited and when I asked for more- the waitress said no and that there was not enough..... for a restaurant???!!!\n\nWe are not going back - but people should notice that for a cuban restaurant - the owner and staff are no where near cuban.........

<review>"""It sounded like fun but fell a little short of expectations.\nLiving social sponsored the cruise. $60 a person. They had lots of friendly staff on hand to check everyone in. \nWe heard the boat was air condioned but noticed only the bottom half of this double decker was sealed in for such. Just like Titanic, we knew only half the passengers were going to make it. So we got as close to the front of the line as possible. We made it inside and grabbed a couple seats. The poor people opposite us had seats but couldn't sit down because plastic stacking chairs were stored there. They shouldn't use precious AC space for storage!\nSoon after we shoved off they opened the front doors and hot, 107 degree air blasted through the cabin. Everyone was complaining but the crew said they had to circulate fresh air through because of the sterno candles used to keep the buffet food warm. There was nothing fresh about that air! \nWe had punch cards, wrist bands, and tickets for drinks and food control. God forbid someone got an extra cup of soda. The food was good but not $60 a person good. \nThe lake and scenery was beautiful. \nAfter dinner was music from a steel drum band and dancing. But it was only one guy on one steel drum playing with a cassette. And I don't know where there was a dance floor because it was packed like sardines. I think there was 4 square feet total.\nAnywho, It killed a couple hours and was an experience when you'r sick of the dry desert.

We call over the manager and explain what happened.

It made us feel unwelcome and as if they thought we were at fault for what had happened.  \n\nI come here mainly for the shrimp and scallops enchiladas, which I absolutely love.  In the past few years, I have noticed the quality of the food decline.  The shrimp/scallop enchiladas used to come out piping hot with lots of cheese and covered in a rich cream sauce.  The last few times I have been to the restaurant, the tortilla has been dry, no sauce, and it looks like they just slapped two pieces of sliced cheese on top of the enchilada.

Receiving a refund for this faulty billing requires no less then hours of emails, phone calls, at least 1 hand written snail mail letter, and the promise of your first born as a paper delivery boy. (ok so the last one was a exaggeration but still)\n\nWhen we moved from a home in Gold Canyon in Dec of 2009 we cancelled a month to month subscription until we got settled into our new place (we did not want the paper going wasted)  I was asked what day I wanted the cancellation effective and I told them \immediately.\"""" The very next day we stopped getting the paper delivered to our home- However the following month the charge was automatically deducted from our account. After several phone calls I eventually hand wrote a letter and mailed it to the Republic- A month later we got a refund and an apology letter.\n\nIn November of 2010 I joined Coupon$ense and through their AZ Republic vendor started a new subscription that included 3 Sunday papers each week (plus a W, F and Sat paper) Since I only needed the coupons in the Sunday paper (and they are supposedly gtd to be in only home delivery papers and not those on the rack) I felt trapped into this excessive subscription. The waste eventually got to me and I  left the Coupon$ense program-(another review to come shortly!) I was told by Coupon$ense that I had to cancel my Republic subscription personally separately (even though they were the ones that set it up and never gave me an account number) -Regardless of the fact that I had an email from the Republic with my subscription information (minus an account number) when I called to cancel, my account could not be located.  Finally after 3 different customer service reps-someone was able to locate my account and cancel it.  The next day I got an email confirming that the cancellation had been processed and we stopped getting papers.\n\n2 days later the monthly subscription fee was automatically deducted from my bank account\n\nSee the pattern here?\n\nMy advise- skip the home delivery and take a jog down to QT on Sunday mornings to get those bright colored comics and just check to be sure the paper you pick up as a stack of coupons in it. It will save lots of money and hassle."""""""

<review>After reading all the reviews, I really expected more from this place.  Their pulled pork sandwich was not very good.  The meat was tough, and there was no smokey flavor whatsoever from the meat, just an incredibly sweet sauce with ketchup consistency that overpowered everything.  The other sauces on the table were just as bad.  The sides were pretty good, however.  I liked the blue cheese slaw and the cowboy beans, but sides are not enough for a BBQ place to stand on.  Normally, I like to visit a place several times and try multiple things from the menu before I can say whether I like it or not.  Because the pork was so bad, I'm reluctant to give this place another shot.  I'm from the South, and I haven't really found any place in AZ that can cook pulled pork properly (only Pork on a Fork comes close).  However, the pulled pork I had to day at the BBQ Co. was some of the worst I've had in the Phoenix area.

<review>"""Before we even sat down to our table, my party and I sat in the bar for a glass of wine. With their extensive wine list, I assumed we could taste a glass before purchasing a $100 bottle of wine, unfortunately for us, they charge for wine tasters. (which I happen to think is CRAZY, considering I work at a similar kind of restaurant) ...But where to start?.....Broken wine glasses on the table when we first sat down. Ordered a baked brie appetizer, that was cold in the center. On several occasions our drinks were empty for 15+ minutes before someone would even walk over to our table. Our server was terrible, the bus boy did 3x the amount of work. No communication coming from the server at all. The food was \alright\"""", we ordered scallops and filet, definitely not worth another $200 or a trip back."""""""

<review>I'm trying the places close by my temporary Tempe home... it's tough to give more than two stars after my experience here.\n\nI walked by on my way to Food Town, and I picked up a menu.  In  perusing the offerings, I was struck by the Thai Basil Chicken combination. I figured with egg roll and Lo Mein, the combination would probably work.  After picking up the Food Town items, I walked toward Gourmet Wok.\n\nOn opening the door and walking in, I was the only customer in the restaurant.  When I passed by earlier, picking up the menu, there were no customers in the restaurant.  The only people in the restaurant were a waitress, her child and another lady at the same table.  The tables and chairs...Goodwill Industries.  The menu board...with lots of prices that have not been updated, even though the prices in the paper menu have...I thought I might have found the proverbial 'hole in the wall' for take-away Chinese cuisine.\n\nI compared prices between the picture board, the written menu on the wall and the paper menu in my hands.  The prices on certain items varied based on which source you ordered from.  My Thai Basil Chicken combination cost $6.55 based on the paper menu.  With tax, I paid $7.14.  The person who took my order advised I would wait 5 minutes and my order would be ready.\n\nI walked to the local literature distribution near the front door, where I picked up the coffee-time news.  After reading my horoscope and several articles about truffles, I was called to pick up my order.  3:20 on my watch.  This was either an extremely coordinated cook or certain items were cooked before being commingled with all the ingredients.  \n\nThe person who took my order brought the bag to the counter, handles looped through one-another.  I opened the bag, took a peek and everything looked appropriate.  I asked for some pepper oil, and was provided with a container.  Out the door and 2 blocks to the homestead...I walked in, unburdened from the trip, washed my hands and prepared to open the box for dinner.  \n\nThe egg roll...it had been sitting under a heat lamp...there were no grease spots on the envelope.  Cabbage, carrots, but no seasoning...frozen, not prepared fresh.  No Lo Mein...but rice cooked in yellow broth, and it was a little hard, like it could have cooked for 2 or 3 more minutes.  As hard as I tried, I just could not enjoy the rice, either.  \n\nLast but not least, the Thai Basil Chicken with no basil.  I'm betting the cook did not read the order, or chickie who took the order wrote down chicken with broccoli, because while there was no basil, the broccoli was in large quantity and cooked to perfection.  The chicken...no.  It must have been cut and then steamed and left in a tray in the preparation area.  The pieces were very uniform, very soft (beyond tender) and flavorless.  While I could not see what the cook was doing in preparation, my bet is that he took already prepared broccoli, carrots and onion and tossed 'em with the chicken pieces, then slathered the whole thing in sauce.  \n\nFirst time, not very impressed.  I will give them one more try, because every time I go by, the place is always empty.  Maybe if they get the chance to impress, and succeed, they could grow.

<review>"""This was the 3rd time I used Northside (same tech every time). I was always very happy with them in the past. This time, we moved in to a house with very dirty carpet. The Tech up sold us on the \power scrubber\"""" which was $160 and \""""guaranteed\"""" that no spots would resurface. Spots came right back up in all of the rooms and near all baseboards was still dirty. \n\nWhen I called the gal on the phone tried to tell me that it was just the underside of the carpet coming through. This made absolutely no sense. I'm in design and buy carpet for a living. This carpet is in a 3 year old house to boot. The tech came back out, but wasn't very happy. I showed him all of the spots and dirty areas. He said again there was no way spots could come back up wit the \""""power scrubber\"""". But, there they were! He proceeded to spend 2 minutes spraying a few areas with a water bottle and then left. The carpet is still dirty. \n\nI referred them to about 5 friends in the past and won't do it again. What a waste of money this was. Pretty disappointed. A company should not offer a guarantee if they don't plan to honor it."""""""

<review>"""I went here today for some coffee and maybe something to eat.  \n\nThe door was opened for me upon approaching it, and I was warmly greeted by a man who I assumed to be the owner.  That was awesome.\n\nGetting inside, there are children crawling around on the ground and on furniture, literally screaming... and it smells.\n\nI walked up to the counter and a girl said \hi,\"""" I said, \""""hi,\"""" and I looked  up at the menu to see what I wanted... I kept looking and kept thinking and she remained silent and just stared at me.... this is not the kind of service I expect at a coffee shop... maybe some suggestions, or questions... \""""so is this your first time here?\"""" would have been nice.  Just silence.\n\nI ended up just ordering a toddy, and it was okay.  I prefer the ones from Cartel most definitely though. \n\nI went to throw my straw wrapper away and the counter with forks and condiments and sugar and whatnot was visibly sticky and gross.  There was a bin with a sign over it reading \""""dirty dishes,\"""" that was indeed FILLED with dirty, smelly dishes.\n\nThe owner thanked me and said goodbye on my way out."""""""
</review>
<review>"""Okay, I'll give them one star for selection and one star for price. Beyond that, I am unimpressed and terribly irritated. \n\nI have frequented both the Camelback and Desert Ridge locations and experienced the following: \n1. Complete and \Total\"""" absence of anything even resembling Customer Service \n2. Frustration at the a$$ backwards way the items are organized. \n\nTo the first point, I have NEVER been asked by ANY member of the staff \""""Can I help you find anything today?\"""" Even when I was shopping toward the front of the store, within sight of the cashiers who were just standing at their registers chatting to each other, and I was making a point of trying to flag someone down to answer a question, was I only met with a passing glance and a look of utter inconvenience. There were three cashiers, no on in-line, yet no one stepped forward or even acknowledged my existence. This was at the Desert Ridge location. \n\nAt the Camelback location just this passed weekend, I called ahead and spoke to Eric, inquiring as to whether they carried and had Abita or Dixie beer in-stock (it's the weekend before Mardi Gras and a week or so after the Super Bowl, so I figured Louisiana beer might be a bit slim on the ground, which is why I called ahead rather than drive all over town.) \""""Oh yeah! I've got several kinds of Abita in-stock\"""" confirmed Eric. \""""Great!\"""" But what did I behold upon arriving not an hour later? No Abita. None. Only itty bitty \""""Temporarily Out of Stock\"""" slips on the shelf label. (You may want to make those signs a tad bigger, guys. Amongst the vast sea of labels that is the entire store, a Post-It-sized afterthought of an \""""Out of Stock\"""" sticker isn't exactly an eye-catcher). So I turned to the guy stocking shelves on the other side of the aisle (who had not acknowledged my existence) and asked him about the Abita. \""""Um, uh, I dunno...I'll go check.\"""" And so he disappeared, never to return or be heard from again.  Apparently he got distracted by the inconspicuous Post-its. \n\nThe other issue I have with Total Wine is it's lay-out. I was taught to read from Left to Right. Usually the Alphabet is also presented Left to Right. However, Total Wine has decided to turn the English-speaking world on it's ear and present it's stock \""""Alphabetically\"""" from Right to Left. W...T...F? Now, I understand that the customer, when walking through the store, starts at the front of the aisle and walks backward. This is the only reason I can see for putting the A's toward the front of the store and the Z's toward the back. Sure...I get it. But here's the thing: not only is it counter-intuitive to any customer who has been schooled in English grammar and the rules of Alphabetization, but it also allows your customers to walk only the front of the store if they are looking for any brand that starts with the first few letters of the alphabet. Why not put the A's all the way at the back where, not only will the customer be visually organize the selection reading from Left to Right, but also force the customer to walk past all the entire selection to get to products whose name starts with an \""""A\""""? I'll bet my Seghesio Zin that there are more breweries and vineyards whose names start with \""""A\"""" or \""""B\"""" than those that start with \""""Y\"""" or \""""Z.\"""" \n\nThere's a reason Costco puts the soda and the toilet paper at the very back of the store: it's so you have to walk past all the other product to get to it, thereby increasing the customer's likelihood of purchasing more than just the required toilet paper and soda pop."""""""
</review>
<review>A friend and I stopped here today for lunch. I for some reason thought it was an odd choice, but he seems to go often and enjoys it. In fact the woman taking the order said to him, no drive through today? It would looks as though he is known in the whataburger world. \n\nThe people working here are very friendly if not a little disconnected. I ordered a whataburger with cheese and onion rings and a small drink. I opted for the Hi-C. I do not like sloppy food and this burger would not have been if the bun had held up. But as it is onions lettuce and tomatoes are falling all over the place. The meat was dry and lacking an particular flavour. The onion rings were very generic and sort of soggy. I loved the Hi-C. \n\nYou know you just never know if you will like something until you try it. I tired it and that is enough. Nice friendly folks though. I do like friendly.

<review>So I've eaten at this restaurant before. However, the other night we had a guest in from out of town and an event earlier in the evening. So we booked a reservation at this restaurant, WHICH THEY CONFIRMED.\n\nWhen we walked into the restruant the place wasn't very busy and the greeter informed us that our reservation wasn't going to be honored, but, we were welcome to order a drink at the bar.  Because it was already after 9 at that point we had a difficult time finding a place that could accommodate us on such short notice. \n\nInterestingly we didn't even have the latest reserved seating they were offering, there was one or two even later. \n\nI eat out and entertain a lot for business and personal.  I rarely write totally negative reviews. But, Not honoring a reservation that a restaurant has not only taken but, have CONFIRMED just because the staff is lazy and wants to go home is completely unacceptable and shows a general lack of customer service and care for the client.\n\nI do agree with an earlier reviewer.. If you want seafood go to mccormicks and schmicks or for a more local flare, The Salt Cellar.
</review>
<review>Had I written this review yesterday because I was hungry, craving pasta and eating here pretty late at 9 pm, it would have gotten one more star for coming to my rescue while driving around looking for food.  24 hours later , with a clearer mind, i can say this place is average. The bread very plain, the shrimp linguine quite bland. The service and decor are quite good though. And finally, so Not the place to go for a meal for one.The size of helpings is HUGE. I had enough left over for lunch. Which would have been a good thing had the food been tasty.
</review>
<review>We were ever hopeful about sampling great tacos!  Got there around  2:30pm and the line was gigantic to get in.  We kept walking down over the bridge to the Cowboy Ciao area and the line still kept going.  Then we heard people who were leaving the festival saying vendors were already out of tacos!  No sense in waiting 30 minutes in line just to get in and pay $10+ without full opportunity to sample...so we skipped it.  :(\nHopefully organizers will plan more shade, better flow and longer lasting food supplies from the vendors next year!
</review>
<review>"""There is nothing \Fantastic\"""" about this place.  I used a money mailer coupon to try it out.  Immediately when I walked in I felt a bad vibe.  Seemed the girls there weren't too happy, and apparently the new owner was there (to observe?) and looked like she just ate a % and it sandwich.  No smiles or friendly attitude at all.  Worst of all was the haircut itself.  Forgot the stylists name, but she was middle aged with straight dirty blonde hair.  I don't know if she was distracted by trying to talk during the cut, but she seemed to have no idea (or seemed to care) of what style I wanted.  One of the worst haircuts I ever had.  Never going back."""""""
</review>
<review>Not cool... and Jessica is never going back.\n\nSo I went home that night and searched for my receipt.  Nope... I remember her asking me if I wanted a receipt and all they do is clutter my already overflowing purse, so I said no... trusting they did my hair right.\n\nI walk in receiptless.\n\nAnd get rejected because I don't have my receipt.\n\nNope.\n\nBye bye now... that wasn't cool... and now neither is my hair because I had to go to Target and buy friggen shears to fix it myself... it was THAT bad.
</review>
<review>Sadly, I would NEVER go back to this shop or recommend anyone.  I was ready to go 500 miles to witness my first grandchild be born and knew I needed a new tire.  So, I ran over to this shop, and instead of getting one or maybe even two tires I was told I needed ALL FOUR replaced!  I was in shock, as my son is a certified mechanic, and was at work, so I didn't have time to have him verify, but he would have warned his mother of this, if needed.  I agreed to this, feeling like I had no choice, and asked them to put one of the tires, which still had plenty of tread as my spare.  After all was said and done, I had paid a ridiculous amount, extra fees added to my quote, felt completely preyed upon as a woman there alone, and my spare had NOT been replaced as I asked.  I had been completely ripped off.  When I got home, my son was furious, as he said there is NO way all four of those tires needed to be replaced.  As I was on my way to a celebration of my grandchild, I did not have the energy or time to spend going back to fight this negative situation - rather, I will make sure and NOT EVER go there again, nor refer anyone!  I have since found and used Joes' Tires in Chandler, and they have been honest, reasonable and awesome to deal with EVERY time!! Sad, that a single mother, can't trust a nationally known tire shop.

<review>If your buying a Mastercool evap from Home Depot do not have Delta Mechanical install it!   Less then a week after having Delta out a second time after installation and the Mastercool was supposably fine, it started making quite a bit of noise. I hired a heating  and  cooling company to see why the Mastercool was making so much noise. They found that it was not level, one side was an inch higher, the belt was too tight, the water level was too high causing a lot of water drainage out the pvc pipe.  Besides all of that they left the cookie tray laying up on the roof and didn't supply a customer care booklet nor the warranty card with the cooler.  I must say though they do excell at blowing smoke up your ass!

<review>Oil, Oil, Oil ... too much oil on the food ... unless I went on a bad day, these guys are clueless as to how to cook good/great barbeque.  My wife ordered a beef brisket sandwich and the oil was just dripping off of it ... She tried to squeeze it, so that there wouldn't be so much and a bunch of oil came rushing out ....  lucky, we had the sauce on the side or it would have destroyed the interior of my car  ... you don't cook barbeque so it's like a greasepit ... people in arizona have no clue as to what good southern BBQ is all about ... I also ordered the sweet fries and they came rolled in a ball and again dripping with oil ... It's a glorified grease pit and you better have a bathroom nearby, because my wife had me driving home 80 miles an hour so she could take care of business ... Joe's BBQ in Mesa is much better and the food is dryer (still not as good as back east, but pretty darn good overall) ... Stacy is trying to serve up a sponge ... As bad as the BBQ in Arizona usually is, this takes it to a new low ...  I wouldn't eat there for free ... Go yourself and notice that it is dripping grease from the moment they hand it to you .... Realize that once you eat that stuff you have no idea what kind of pain you can feel afterwords ....   Note: the service was better than expected ... very polite-nice girls ... Grade D- ... these are all my opinions and no I don't work for any of the competitors (here in arizona) aren't that great either-trust me ...

<review>Our car's driver side window was smashed as we sadly observed when we finally made our way out of this restaurant (hours later)on this less than stellar evening..we spent yet more time cleaning glass off of the seats just to FINALLY get to drive away from the Ghetto cafe..er Barrio cafe...but I digress..\n\nI don't know.... I guess a place that consistently has between an hour and 2 hour wait on a Saturday and doesn't take reservations has got to be beyond fabulous and worth waiting for right? You think? Wow..I am actually embarrased I fell for this. This must be what the people who bought Charlie Sheen tickets felt like...  Sucker! That is what I felt like last night for sure. First off, we had swung by here a couple of different Saturdays but (smartly) decided the wait wasn't worth it...my bf really wanted to try it ( be careful what you wish for)..so we got there (early for us) around 6:45 pm last night to put our name down and do the CRAZY hour and 30 minute waiting game...did I mention the bar area and patio are tiny and you get the added experience of being packed in like cows in an unorganic dairy farm....\n\nOk..so the food portion of the review...two words...mediocre and overrated...the guacamole was salty...i didn't get to see it prepared tableside because the restaurant was so crowded and small the server (who gets 4 personal stars because she was sweet)...literally couldn't fit the preparation cart anywhere near our table...our main dishes...were just ok.....nothing tasted particulary fantastic and the dining room felt hot with no air circulation...thank goodness for the wine....\n\nThis is probably one of the loudest restaurants I have ever been to...I was thinking no way will I be returning..that idea was more than cemented when we saw the glass damage...wtf? Maybe if you took reservations Barrio.. and had a decent parking situation..people wouldn't be sans their car for 3 hours just to eat dinner in the hood.

<review>"""Maybe my hopes were too high when I made plans to go to Sunsplash.  I was overwhelmed by the crowd.  So many people were crammed into this relatively small space.  Never in my life have I seen a line for a wave pool.  I typically think of the wave pool as a retreat from the lines.  Not at Sunsplash. The lazy river was so packed I could hardly see the \river\"""" part.  Not exactly a relaxing experience.  \n\nNot only that, but the water park seemed less than sanitary.  I saw several people with bloody noses, and I couldn't help but wonder when the last time they thoroughly sanitized the place.  The park is also open at night...I will not be venturing over to Sunsplash after dark.  You know what likes to come out at night?  Bugs.  Big ones.  (I'm a Coloradan...call me spoiled...but large bugs just aren't a part of life where I'm from.)\n\nThe slides are fun, especially the gigantic ones.  If you plan to go on the big slides, be sure to bring your friends!  Expect to carry a massive raft up several flights of stairs.  There are no mechanisms that bring the empty rafts up to the slide entrance for customers.  I got a workout just by hauling our raft around!\n\nWhatever you do, do NOT open your water bottles prior to entering the park.  They will throw them out.  Bring a few gigantic bottles and rent a locker; a large cup of ice can be purchased at the concession stand for 25 cents.  Bring cash too.  A locker is $11, but you receive $5 back when you present your receipt with the locker key.  Also, I recommend bringing some plastic flip-flops.  There's nothing worse than tromping around dirty grounds covered with strangers' hairs and other disgusting debris.  \n\nFood is quite pricey (no surprise here).  It is a fun place to spend a Saturday, just don't expect anything too elaborate."""""""

<review>As I was surveying the places near my work to eat I was hoping that this was a different alternative to the Panda Express closeby. \n\nNot so much. I believe I paid something like $9 and everything was drenched in oil. I thought maybe I'd hit a goldmine by getting tons of sushi, but it's just mediocore and tempura coated pieces were just soggy. Hot and sour soup tasted obscenely sour. I didn't even go back to get seconds (even though I ALWAYS) do this at a buffet- not because I was full, but because my stomach could not agree with me.\n\nThey are pretty quick in cleaning up after your plates, so quick that if you accidently left food on it, they'll still take it.. so don't leave your food alone at your table if you're planning to return to eat it.\n\nPayment is due after your meal, strange but true. This is supposed to be an Asian buffet, but there's nothing Asian or authentic about the food.
</review>
<review>This did not start out well.  I showed up for breakfast only to find I had to cool my heels in the parking lot until they opened at 7.  And they actually opened at 7:04.  And even then they really were not ready to serve customers.  I got my coffee fairly quick, then my orange juice, then my bread (muffin) and finally about 7:30 my breakfast entree.  The waitress even apologized for the excessive wait time.\n\nThe food itself was ok.  I had chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, fruit and a muffin.  The muffin was applesauce something and was really good and huge.  The gravy was sort of thin.  None of the flavors stood out.  Being a little more expensive than some other breakfast spots I expected more taste.  That and being late/slow cost it a half star and in this case I chose to round down.
</review>
<review>Kelly's Cajun used to be my number 2 favorite fast food in the valley. I'd regularly pick up a Blackened Chicken /  Honey Lemon Chicken combo after a long night evening in the lab at ASU. It was quick, the portions were extremely generous, and the Asian family that ran it was always friendly and acted like they were old friends whenever I'd drop by. \n\nUnfortunately the family that ran it is gone and the food has suffered for it. \n\nWhat was once a delectably spicy Cajun flavor on the blackened chicken, is now scaled back severely and is mild by comparision.  The garlic noodles were once actually garlicky are now just slippery and greasy. The Honey Lemon chicken is now overcooked and has lost nearly all of it's unique sweetness. The most egregious difference is that the new ownership has entirely removed the Cajun potatoes from the selection of sides available.\n\nIf I were to write this review a year ago, I would have agreed with the other review by W. It was a hidden gem in Arizona Mills mall. It's now just meh. I'm now looking for another spot to get my Cajun fix. Any suggestions?

<review>"""M took T and I to the brand new Tempe Marketplace.  Walking through, it's such a scene: a place to see and be seen. That's great! A social and public space.  More places need to be like this.  In fact, it reminds me of the Irvine Spectrum more or less in Orange County.\n\nWe decided on Lucille's given time and that it seemed to be a good Arizona restaurant.  The irony: we learned that eight (8) of the 10 locations were located in California. Go figure.  We looked at the menu; we looked at the decor:  Joe's Crab Shack is to seafood as Lucille's is to BBQ.\n\nWe ordered a appetizer sampler, rib sampler, tri-tip wedge salad, and a bbq chicken salad. While I enjoyed the tri-tip salad, T stated the bbq flavor was nonexistent on her chicken salad.  Go figure.\n\nSo what do you expect from a chain?  It does its job to feed you and overstimulate you with decor and witty, though nice, staff and good, live music.  Don't mind the food, but the atmosphere is entertaining.  I really don't mind such places if I'm going there for happy hour or a quick meal - but you really shouldn't expect too much, it's a \chain.\"""""""""""

<review>"""The salad in my sandwich was a great idea.  Lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pepperoncini tossed in balsamic vinegar, oh my, and then piled onto a fresh roll with ham and salami with mayo and mustard.  Not too bad, I must say.  It is, however, too bad the salami was a cheaper kind and not a dry Italian salami.  It kind of made the sandwich a little salty, but doo-able none the less.\n\nI ordered the pasta salad as a side.  I wont make that mistake again.  It's my understanding that pasta salad will be on the acidic side, usually involving vinegar of some kind.  This pasta salad was not acidic at all.  it included cabbage, carrots, sun-flower seeds and a taste that I still cant place.  It looked like it was a \bus-tub\"""" salad.  I took two bites and gave up, no sense in wasting calories.\n\nOverall, I think this place has potential, but my experience was nothing to write home about, sorry mom.\n\nFortunately for the rest of you . . . . I'm addicted sharing my experiences: be them bad, good or just so-so, lucky you!!"""""""

<review>"""We've eaten at this Chipotle several times and, although it is not one of my favorite places to eat, I recognize that the supposed quality of the food may be better than other fast food restaurants.  That being said today's experience was not a good one!  We arrived just before noon and there were few people there.  The employees were apparently  filling an order that seemed to be causing them some trouble and our food, once started, sat on the prep line for longer that it should have before they finished it.  I took two bites of my taco and the meat was refrigerator cold, not lukewarm from sitting on the counter too long.  I informed the manager and suggested that perhaps their warming trays were not operating properly and she checked and said everything was at targeted temperature.  I had her touch the meat in my taco to demonstrate that the meat was cold.  She agreed with me and said she would make me another.  15 minutes later, since my husband had finished his meal, I approached her and asked that my money be refunded.  She said she had totally forgotten about my taco and she couldn't refund my money because the cash register had frozen and she was trying to get someone on the phone.  Only after I stood there a moment did she offer a \card\"""" for the next time we visit.  I told her there wouldn't be a next time.  I can forgive one oversight, even two on a restaurant visit, but these folks totally \""""dropped the ball\"""" on ours."""""""

<review>"""This place gets two stars not because it sucks, but just because it's very \meh\"""". I heard alot of hype about this place from friends and my Hispanic friends as well that kept calling this place the \""""Mexicans' Mexican restaurant\"""". Well, if that's the case, then clearly Mexican cuisine leaves much to be desired.\n\nI ordered a flauta dish that was large in portion size and skim on flavor. Like most Mexican food however, I felt like I was busting at the seams after I was walking out of the restaurant. One good thing I will say about this place though is that their chips and salsa are pretty good. In the end, I really don't know what was worse: my deflated expectations or my burning intestines the next morning."""""""

<review>"""I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.\n\n On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos). \n\nAfter this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to \stop harassing the fish.\"""" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to \""""harass\"""" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too). \n\nI won't be doing business here when I move."""""""

<review>"""When I am craving Thai, nothing else will satisfy.  My friend and I visited Thai Basil as it was the closest Thai destination to her home, and I ordered my favorite dish of panang curry with shrimp...\n\nAnd I'll lay it on the line... it was pretty vile.  I'm shocked at the numerous five-star reviews I read of this particular location, because really this dish tasted nothing like the millions of other panang curries that I have tasted in my life. It was just so heavy on the peanut flavor, and utterly lacking in any other... and the shrimp were rubbery and almost inedible.  I hardly ate any, so my kind friend wrapped it up, and said excitedly, \You have an awesome lunch ready for work tomorrow!\"""" And I didn't have the heart to tell her that there was no way I'd be able to warm it up.\n\nIt's too bad... they were very friendly, it was reasonably priced, and it was a cute little place.  My dining partner seemed to enjoy her dish... maybe it was just a bad night for the curry."""""""

<review>"""I guess we had been \built-up\"""" too much for this new restaurant on Greenfield in Mesa. There was TONS of teenage help, but the service was SLOW for as many staff as they had. My son wanted something else after he tried the Pot Roast sandwich, but when he ordered, it was wrong TWICE. I had to go up and find a \""""Manager\"""" who looked to be at least one year older than the rest to try and straighten it out. It took some time to get it right, but finally they wrapped their heads around it. A LARGE amount of grab-ass was going on between the girls and boys and the young man handling our food kept throwing it in the window and then retrieving it again, just to give it a harder toss to see if he could get the lid of the contained to pop open??? If you don't expect much, you probably won't be disappointed. Very standard fast food and service. The sides on my 2 pc cod dinner were cold and not appealing at all. We didn't get ice cream, but hear that it is good. Maybe next time."""""""

<review>Came here with a large group one night when a military friend was back in town. We came VIP. Service was horrible. We ordered rinks and 4 bottles and we had to go to the bar and ask for them.  We went walking around only to not be let in another VIP spot because the idiot who let us in forget to give us bracelet things. \n\nI am pretty sure the guys with me were the only straight ones in the bar that night. I saw WAY too many dudes kissing each other. \n\nWe complained about our horrible treatment and we got offered a VIP pass for next time. What a JOKE! I will never come back here an hope no one else would ever go there either!
</review>
<review>I wanted to go somewhere I've never been before. Gallo Blanco or The Parlor? I read great things about both places but I decided on The Parlor. Walking in this place made me think of the Vig because the decor is very similar.  The food and drink menu looked great.  I was really hungry and started out with the bruschetta and a watermelon agua. The drink was light and refreshing, not too sweet, and you can tell that they use fresh watermelon juice instead of that pucker crap. The bruschetta mix had a sweet taste to it that I didn't like but nothing that salt and pepper couldn't fix. My sister ordered the grinder and I ordered the pepperoni pizza because our waiter suggested it. I took a bite out of my sisters sandwich and it was very plain but the french fries were awesome. My pepperoni pizza was greasy and burnt. I wasn't impressed. The Parlor didn't live up to its hype and everything here looks great but doesn't deliver.

<review>I don't generally like fast food because it's just gross but I was starving and we had a 3 hour layover.  \n\nMy sub was like eating a brick of salt.  I could only eat half of it and that was really pushing it. \n\nI asked the cashier for a napkin. She pointed to the empty containers and told me they were over there.  After looking and telling her they were empty she sent someone out to refill them.  I waited 10 minutes for a napkin.

<review>First of all, I incorrectly thought I was going to the other high rated Hawaiian place because I didn't pay attention to the name or address.  I just knew this place replaced Julio too's (dating myself) and checked it out.  \n\nPretty much everything about my meal was poor.  All of the sides are either really bad impersonations of Korean sides, or corn straight out of the Del Monte can.  The seaweed used white vinegar, the cabbage was bland, and the clear noodle things were just not tasty.  \n\nI got a combo plate with BBQ chicken and the short ribs.  The short ribs were chewy with very tough fat on them.  They were not that good.  The BBQ chicken was not that good either and resembled slimy dark meat chicken that you find in a Panda Express rice bowl.  I guess the white rice was... white... and made of rice.  At least they didn't screw that part up.\n\nfor $10 I expect a much better meal.  I ate about half of it and threw the rest away.  I will never go back, and if you are someone that wants a lot of these flavors, go check out Cho Dang in Chandler.  It seems a lot of Paradise's (horribly ironic name) food is highly influenced by Korean food but poorly done.  You can get a better meal at a sit down place for less money at Cho Dang.  \n\n If you want food that rivals Samurai Sam's, Kyoto Bowl, or Panda Express than this is your place.  If you want decent food I suggest looking elsewhere.  I will be checking out the other Hawaiian joint around the corner to see if it is any better.  I am clueless on how this place averages 4 stars.  They deserve 1 star, but I was going to be nice and go with 2.  However, I just remembered that they do not have a public restroom which always chaps my ass.

<review>"""Oh Good Lord Baby Jesus.  How I loath clubs like these ... nothing againts this place ... just the genre in general.\n\nI was there REALLY early but there were so few \ladies\"""" and the guys for the most part looked like middle aged tools desperate for a date.\n\nThen again, perhaps a large part of it may have had something to do with the party in celebration of a calendar of Big Ten college girls in swimsuits (how novel!).\n\nThis is EXACTLY why Scottsdale is ... well ...

<review>"""Great selection offset by their terrible customer service.\n\nI've been here a few times, usually to pick up some small thing or another. The first time, I was looking for a digital caliper and a very small allen wrench. I had to track down three employees before one knew how to look for it in the computer. One actually took me back to the aisle I was in, and said \Huh, it's not here.\"""" Ya think?!\n\nAfter the last time I went in, I won't be back. When I found the hardware employee (an older gentleman) and explained what I was looking for, he laughed at me and said he couldn't help. Several other employees walked by, none of them particularly concerned about anything. One was even holding his vest instead of wearing it. \n\nGo to ACE instead."""""""
</review>
<review>The food was okay but the service was horrible.  The table was not cleaned when we were seated. A girl came to clean the table with a smelly dirty rag and brushed all the crumbs on our laps. I asked if she would please get a clean cloth. When she came back she argued with me...told me the last one was clean. If a cloth smells enough for me to notice then it's full of bacteria and not at all clean. No wifi either. Why? The waitress said it's because people stay too long. I will not be visiting any Applebee's again.

<review>Decided to check this place out because they had a good deal on GrouponNow.\n\nVery unprofessional and unorganized. Look, just because you are an aesthetician doesn't mean you can run a business. This particular establishment is a prime example.\n\nI bought the GrouponNow which is only valid for a time specified for one day. In this case I had until 6pm to redeem. I tried calling all morning to schedule an appt. No answer.\n\nSo I just went down there. Walked in, rang the bell, heard some ladies chatting in the back. After waiting for 15 mins, I finally walked into the back and said HELLO?! Finally the owner came out and said they were closed. Closed? I informed her that she had a GrouponNow running that day. She apologized and offered me a free treatment for my inconvenience. I appreciated that and left.\n\nWhen I called back to schedule they said they were booked up for the next month! Today, I saw another GrouponNow for them and decided to call and see of they had any openings. This time, at least someone answered the phone! She told me they were booked up the next month. What?\n\nI'm just confused as to why this business keeps running GrouponNow specials that people cannot redeem?\n\nA med spa needs to be staffed and organized before they open their doors. This business is an unprofessional disaster. I hope people check Yelp before buying Groupons to so-called med spas.

<review>Worst, slow service ever....especially with almost no one in the place. Food was average at best and thats being kind. Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink.\n\nJust an update: I (as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day) were contacted (I didn't see my message until today oops) and offered refunds and gift certificates. Now this seems all well and fine-I do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situation-but my friend is still waiting for a refund and/or certificate. So we shall see. If I could take away my star for more non-service then I would.

<review>Standard scottsdale decor and house music playing.....so I knew what to expect. Had pan fried pork potstickers. The wraps were straight up rubber. The filling was like well........wet cat food. I have personally wrapped a few thousand of theese AND cooked them and this was a poor attempt at best. Our food hit the table 30 secs later. Kudos the chef for the timing. Mongolian beef was good. I like the thick slices of beef but a little overkill on the scallions. Now desert. . Ugh.....flourless chocolate cake. Staight out of the box and fridge. No bueno. Not to mention our waitress said they messed it up 3 times in back. Then dumped an astoundingly gross amount of raspberry on plate and got it out 15 mins later. Our server was nice and did her job....and thanks to the bartender for the grasshoper! They are the only reason I gave 2 stars. Wont be back for that food at $14 bucks a plate! Im goin back to totties!

<review>God only knows how a company can hire such incompetent and disorganized employees.   Does Nationwide provide any training in customer service at all????   \n\nI just don't get it.

<review>"""El Hefe - Macho Taqueria. Man...\n\nAt first glance it looks like every stereotype you've ever heard about Scottsdale. At second glance you realize that it is, indeed, every stereotype you've heard about Scottsdale. It's a \Mexican Restaurant\"""", so when I was there I tried a few of their tacos that were on happy hour. I'm giving two stars because the duck taco that I had was pretty good, but once the food got to the table it took me 4 minutes to figure out which tacos were mine because of the way they present the food. More on this later. \n\nEl Hefe has a cool in-table tap system, where you pay at the table and can pour your own beer. When I saw this I liked it a lot, though they only offer two beers, and it's not cheap. After the \""""cool\"""" factor wears off, you realize that you're paying extra to pour your own beer. Not so cool. The upside is the fact that I get beers for myself much faster than the servers at El Hefe did for me. \n\nThe booth seats are covered in plastic, in the style of your great grandmother. This is assuming, of course, that your great grandmother commissioned Ed Hardy to design her living room group. The ambiance isn't my style, but I'm sure that a lot of people love it...The biggest issue I had is the way the food is brought to the table. They start you with chips and salsa. It seems hard to screw up chips and salsa, but it happened here. The salsa comes in small jars that are downright weird, and they make dipping your chip absolutely impossible. You need to be a salsa MacGyver to figure out how to get the right amount of salsa on your chip...It's strange. After pushing some salsa around with a chip on a small plate for a while, our food arrived. Apparently, when you order tacos, they come 5-6 at a time, placed on wooden slabs that are roughly the size of a Las Vegas buffet. Our server couldn't remember who's tacos were who's, so we played a game of musical tacos (and wooden slabs) until we all figured out what we'd ordered. When a group of 4-5 orders 10+ tacos, you end up with 2-3 giant wooden slabs on your table and a very confusing family style presentation. \n\nLike I said before, the duck taco I had was pretty good, and I hear good things about the BeerRita. However, unless I'm dragged against my will by a large group of people, I don't see myself returning to El Hefe anytime soon."""""""

<review>"""Groupon: Fail. New York: Fail. Deli: Fail. I am pretty sure most New Yorkers would try this place an tell you to Fugeddaboutit and leave it at that but a yelper shares.\n\nI judge a deli on a few things: the meat, the bread, the sides. Being jewish and from the east coast I hold \new york\"""" deli's to a higher standard and judge them on corned beef/pastrami, potato salad, rye bread and pickles. You get those right you have a happy camper, wrong and i'm cranky. I got the I Love New York which is Corned Beef and Pastrami with Swiss and spicy mustard on Rye, probably my favorite sandwich and potato salad anda  kosher pickle.\n\nLets start with the main course it was fair and that is being very favorable. The meats were a bit overcooked but nice and hot and had decent flavored and the pastrami had a good amount of pepper to it (which i like). However it was very greasy and soaked the bread and made it slick...not good. The bread itself wasn't bad just generic rye you would buy on the shelf at any grocery. There also wasn't enough mustard on it or much meat probably double the bread to meat on a $9 sandwich. Compared to Chompies where its a nice thin slice of rye and piles of meat. Overall edible but not that enjoyable.\n\nNow the sides where I decided this place struck out like A-rod in the playoff's. I have never had potato salad that was so bland. I am normally not a huge fan of white potato salad but i do enjoy it. This was probably less exciting to my taste buds than a baked potato with no toppings. I tried dumping on pepper to no avail. Next was the pickle which was a whole \""""kosher dill\"""" and from a new york deli i expect something a bit more more than vlassic out of a jar but that is exactly what i got.\n\nFor the money (and for the record i spent $2 on the groupon) this place just doesn't cut the mustard (pun intended). Better options exists for this stuff like Chompies or Goldman's Deli up in scottsdale."""""""

<review>I went about 2 weekends ago for the first time with my husband and a few friends, all adults that do not have kids. I was very shocked at the price of admission and games, being that Castles N Coasters has very few rides and a so-so mini golf area. \nThe atmosphere was mixed, children playing along side adults. I would almost have peed my pants when I saw how many wonderful arcade games there were inside the two-storied gaming area, but then I got a whiff of the odor.......something of a mix of B.O. and feet? In addition, I was doing great on 2 different games, still on my first 2 credits on each, when kids literally pushed me out of the way, exclaiming it was their turn!!!! \nIf you are like me and my group, childless with little patience for kids, this is not the place for you. Splurge on the more adult friendly Jillian's and grab a beer for me there while you're at it. On the other hand the food was cheap and descent and, the kids seem to love this place. There must be something to it, right?!

<review>"""I actually yelped this restaurant from my brunch table and my blackberry wouldn't post the review.  So, will try to capture the original intensity of the yelp.  I still love my blackberry and maintain it is better than iPhone, by the way!\n\nAnyway, anyone who knows me well appreciates the importance of toast in my life.  When I moved to Phoenix to work for a catholic hospital, my best friend bought me a \Jesus toast\"""" stamp which puts an imprint of the Mary which appears better when the bread is toasted.  I guess she wanted me to fit in.\n\nSo when I told my waiter I was having a \""""bad toast experience\"""" and he blew me off, you can imagine the impact.  I ordered the oatmeal as well as the basket of toasted willow breads served with a variety of jellies, Nutella, honey etc.  My oatmeal came out with over-buttered, grilled bruschetta-style toast; that's it--a plate with a bowl of oatmeal and 3 pieces of bread.  I asked for flatware, then brown sugar and milk, then inquired about my basket of willow bread.  The waiter said, \""""this is the toast that comes with your meal.  I reminded him of my order and he brought me some jam.  I decided to stop complaining (cus I had been making ridiculous requests like being served what I ordered and having utensils).  I put jam on the \""""toast\"""" and it literally tasted like they had grilled it in bacon grease.  Meanwhile the table next to us (the only other occupied table in the restaurant at 10 am on a beautiful Sunday) was getting their cranberry walnut and sourdough bread, perfectly toasted with all the accompaniments.  I told the waiter I wanted toast like theirs and that mine tasted like pork (still a veggie after 25 years) and he said again, \""""this is the toast that comes with your meal\"""".  My friend was getting embarrassed, so I gave it up and left.  How hard is it to bring a girl a new piece of bread?\n\nOk, now all the anger is stirred up... I must say that My florist is one of my fav weeknight spots and their pianist is first rate-amazing.

Cool and mushy... not my idea of a good chip.\n\nMy clam chowder was kind of thin though it tasted OK. It was lacking potatoes. Kinda weird. \n\nOrdered a Strongbow cider on tap... and it's flat. Since the server was nowhere to be found, I went up to the bar. Bartender: \Oh the cider is usually a little flat! Don't worry about it!\"""" (WHAAA???) Me: \""""No - it's really flat.

<review>The BF and I went here this morning after thinking about trying this place for awhile. Let me start by saying that in order to look at their menu online you need to download adobe reader and even then, no prices are listed. That was my first semi complaint, but I figured it would be good, so I shouldn't worry too much about that. So we got there at around noon and the place is cute, big patio and all. We were seated and got water from the very nice bus boy who works there. Our waiter came by and we both ordered coffee, I got the fire island eggs and the BF got the biscuits and gravy. When we got our coffee we were assured that the food would be out shortly. Well...I don't know what shortly means to them, but we waited a good 20 minutes or so for our food. Not so awesome. The BF's coffee was empty for about 10 minutes of this time with no offer to refill and no one around to ask. We get our food and mine was alright...it's chicken in a cream cheese semi spicy sauce on 'pizza' bread (kind of thick...not really crusty, but whatever). The flavor was just very one dimensional and the dish got boring after the first few bites....it was kind of too rich, which isn't something I would generally say. The BF's biscuits and gravy were not good. He said they tasted like a pizza hut meat lover's pizza. The biscuits were not light or flaky and the gravy was just one note...spicy. Plus, the gravy tasted the same as the potatoes that came with it (kind of like peppers)....so it was a big plate of one flavor, and not even a very good flavor. Additionally, and not necessarily the restaurant's fault, there were tons of flies around....they kept landing on our cups and it was somewhat annoying...maybe the trash needs to be taken out more often? Or maybe it's because people had their dogs at this restaurant, which I think is somewhat gross...I don't know, just not so pleasant. So the waiter comes by and takes the plates away and then we sit and wait...and wait...and wait for our check. I don't really understand this because I would think that he would have wanted the check as soon as possible, but maybe he knew he did a poor job and had given up on our table. Either way, after ten more minutes or so we got the check and paid cash to avoid the inevitable long wait if paying with a credit card. The total was 27$...that's pretty pricey considering the quality of this meal...feels like a waste of money to me. So if you like having all of your food taste like peppers and that's it and over paying for that experience....this is the place for you, otherwise, I'd say skip this place.

<review>I've been in this store several times but I've never bought a thing.  It's the kind of place you could go into and buy a cheap accessory to match your outfit, but it's not necessarily the best quality.  They have jewelry, purses, shoes, other accessories and clothing.  I have to admit, it looks kind of cheap, but could probably dress up the right outfit.\n\nI believe they have 2 other locations opening soon (perhaps Mesa and Chandler).\n\nNothing special, but lots to choose from!
</review>
<review>As Arik mentioned in his review, this place can make some good pies. If you're looking to pick up a pie or grab some dessert, this spot can be a good option.\n\nAs far as dining here for lunch or dinner, it's nuthin special. American cuisine with no real surprises. They have an ok salad bar  and  can have some good soups (cheesy potato!) on hand, depending on what they made that particular day.\n\nThey have just about zero vegetarian entree options on the menu. If you're a veg head dragged along to this place for a meal, you'll probably have to custom order some pasta with veggies or get creative in another manner. I'll be trying my best to avoid the place for meals, but meat-eaters might find something enjoyable...

<review>I've thought about this before writing this because of being a small business owners and understanding that maybe the owners and staff just had a bad day.  I didn't want to write this because everyone is entitled to their own opinion of services and food and didn't want to damage another business reputation with just my opinion. So here it goes.\nMy son and I go here to eat all the time because it's convenient instead of having to drive all the way out to Phoenix or Mesa for really good Pho.  It's good, not great by any means but could be great if you just don't know anything about Pho.  However, the service here is the worst I've ever experienced.  I know that Pho places really aren't known for service but this place is just rude.  Try Unphogettable in Mesa so you can see what good food and service is about and you will know what I mean about rude here.\nI've just always put up with it because it's just typical of Pho restaurants.  So, headed back to work, my friend asked me to pick up an order to go for her.  After waiting for about 20 minutes after we were done eating for the to go order even though we placed the order when we ordered our other food too, the order came back wrong.  I told the pregnant owner what our correct order was.  She placed the order by the registered and left us there hanging.  After another 20 minutes, I asked for the order again.  She said they are too busy and have decided not to correct the order.  I asked her why she didn't tell me and would just make me sit there and wait.  No answer other than that she is too busy to deal with it.  So, I pay and put under the tip line none because poor service.  Actually wrote that in so that they won't write in their tips, which they have done once before on me. \nI reconciled my statement over the weekend and pull out my receipt.  Apparently, I have now also been charged the to go order even though I didn't take it.  Called and she answered and argues with me that I took the order.  This is ridiculous.  We are not some scam artist or willing to lie over some $9 order.  Tried to explain to her that we did not but she just hung up the phone on me.  Wow!!  Talk about hormonal...

<review>"""Very good margaritas (although tough to discern quality after your first one is down the hatch) and pretty nice guacamole... sorry, but I make it better. The first time I went to this place, I felt it was an amazing experience, and by far the best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had, followed by one of the best carne asada plates I have ever had as well. So I recommend it for a business outing, which gets everyone excited. Drinks are fine, orders are taken and the guacamole begins to get prepared table side. As soon as we begin to dive into the guac, the soup arrives. One of our guests was in the restroom, and his soup was served while he was away. BAD, BAD waiter.

<review>I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon.

<review>How do I give NO stars? Ok, I get that it is Walmart and to some degree you have to just buck up and deal because it is going to be dirty, everyone who works there is going to by unhappy, etc. However, this Walmart hit a new Walmart low for me this week when I ordered a camera and storage card online to pick it up on this store. \n\nThe card was ready immediately, but the camera would not be ready for pickup for one week. No problem, except I received an e-mail that if I did not pickup the card with 48 hours the card would be put back on the shelf and I would be credited. So I called the store and politely explained that I would like to make only ONE trip to Walmart and asked if they could hold the card a few more days. Before I could finish, I was interrupted by a teenage boy manager and was told there was NO WAY they could hold it and that was policy, no exceptions. When I pressed him he told me I could not speak to the store manager and instead I should call walmart.com. Which I did, and they hung up on me. Awesome.\n\nBottom line: they were unhelpful and because I need the camera for work I kept the order. But that will be the last time I ever deal with Walmart.

<review>If I could award them 0 stars, I would. Simply put, they are horrible! \n\nI ordered flowers through FTD  and  they were handled by this florist. Not only did they not fulfill the order as I placed it (for a 50th birthday gift for a lifelong friend), when I called them, they were condescending, rude  and  bashed the FTD company itself! That is their bread  and  butter as far as I am concerned, and, any disparaging comments toward FTD should have been directed toward FTD, not me. I was the consumer. I spent about $75.00 for these flowers, and, they sent a completely different arrangement than I ordered. When calling to ask about it, they were so rude!\n\nYou've got many choices for florists....keep your hard earned cash for another one because these people do not appreciate your business  and  they do NOT fill orders as you place them. They do whatever they want to do! They used cheap lilies....this is not a funeral arrangement, it's a celebration arrangement!!

<review>"""ZERO stars!\nI traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;\nOne, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!\nOn another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me \a very inhumane person\"""" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).\nBetween the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.\nI have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!"""""""

<review>The contrarian review... from an espresso purists perspective.\n\nIn my desperate search to find espresso near my hotel (which I think is old downtown, but I get confused easily) I put this place on my list.\n\nTo their credit, when I ordered a ristretto con panna, the barista thought she knew what I meant. I clarified, which is fine, and she went about making it. However, it wasn't drinkable. I got it to stay so I could enjoy it if it was decent, so I had to drink some while the barista watched, but I couldn't get it all down, even with 3 sugars (did that make sense to anyone?). I don't think it's even good enough to make a decent latte, either, so I won't be back.\n\nOn the other paw, they were playing some Flyleaf, so the music is good.

<review>"""Terrible service!!!! If you want to wait years for your food only to get the order messed up, please eat here.  Or, you may have items completely forgotten. Find something you love and can't live without, like one of the signature rolls or martinis? Well they won't be the same the next time you come. \n    We've eaten here several times and each time, the rolls have either gotten smaller, were missing some key element (i.e. sauce) or never showed up altogether. Martinis have been the same way. I understand this is a new restaurant and they are trying out new things, but come on.  \n     They also have this reverse happy hour where your bill is 50% off.  The food should NOT reflect this discount. We have dined here both during the reverse happy hour and at full price times, and the food definitely decreases in quality. \n     After giving it one last shot, we were once again disappointed with the service. The owner's wife has been nice up until now. They are clearly understaffed and it's difficult for them to keep orders straight. My husband had a piece of ginger in his drink, and it wasn't even comped! He was actually charged for the one she replaced!  When questioned about it, she had the nerve to ask if he was sure he hadn't had the extra drink. We were also charged for sauce that last time had come with a roll, and when he asked about it he was told it was \decoration, and what's the big deal, we are getting 50% off anyway.\"""" Upon hearing that, after having sat for half an hour waiting for food that was never on it's way in the first place, we were pretty annoyed. On our way out she was rude again. We never would recommend this place to anyone, sad since it does have good food most of the time, when they can get the orders straight and make things as described on the menu. \n     We won't be dining there again. Try Ra or Tanked Fish. The people there make the effort to please the customer, and they aren't even the owners."""""""

<review>I was so happy to find a boba place right around the corner so I wouldn't have to drive several miles to Lee Lee's or Asiana if I didn't feel like making my own.  I requested an iced soy latte boba (like I used to get from my old fave Eba Cafe) but they couldn't make a latte.  I settled for an iced green tea with boba (brewed, not powder). \n\nThe boba had a nice, chewy texture but was totally flavorless.  They were also skimpy on the amount of boba that went in the cup.  The tea itself was bitter (my guess is that they let it brew too long).  All in all, I wasted my five bucks on that and won't be going back again.

<review>I was very disappointed by my last 2 visits here. On one visit I was served cold beans and rice, like from the fridge cold. It took almost 20 minutes to get new beans and rice, and they were still barely warm. No apology, no nothing.\n\nWent again to get my favorite chicken mole tacos, and they were barely warm. My husband had their marinated shredded pork in a burrito and got sick after taking the first bite. This must be an acquired taste, it was gross, really gross. Then I found what looked like a gray slimy booger in my rice. When I pointed it out to the server he took my plate away and came back saying it was an onion!! No way was that an onion, or even a close relative of an onion. No apology, no asking if i want something else, he just came over, slammed the bill down and said we didn't charge you for your food, so don't worry about it, and walked away. \n\nI know mistakes happen, but own up to it, and at least TRY to make the customer feel good about the situation.

<review>I've never checked in at this airport, restricted entirely to layovers. What stands out, however, is how many fellow fliers I spend time with complain about the check-in service and security. I don't know what's going on from that side, but I hear it time and again.\n\nFrom my side, I can't help but notice that I have to change gates nearly every flight thru there. Since I'm usually sleeping, I've been lucky to wake up shortly before the announcement with time to make the gate-change. As has been noted in other reviews, the terminals are far apart and gate changes can be rather drastic.\n\nOne big positive is the lack of arm rests on the seats. This makes it real easy for a peep to catch up on some quality nappage. There are also a lot of places to eat or drink at, all with the standard airport mark-up but with at least some variety. This 'port makes for an acceptable layover, but I've so far been able to avoid checking in here and suggest the same.

<review>I was a fan of this restaurant until this morning.    A few weeks back -- at the end of a morning run --  I saw that True Foods was open for breakfast.    I've stopped there sporadically and I've been, well, underwhelmed.     I liked the carrot bread well enough to return since it was moist and had good ingredients.     I tried the muffin that was second on the list and found it so forgettable I can't remember the ingredients.   \n\nToday was the worst.     I stopped by for carrot bread to go.    When I got home, I realized it was stale.    Dry.    Hard.    I should have returned it but needed to get my day going.    \n\nSo, instead I am warning fellow Yelp-ers who order any baked goods:    Check when it was made.

<review>"""Thanks God for plans with no contracts! This will be one thing I miss about TMobile BUT, with no regrets, I AM NOW A VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMER AGAIN! WOO HOO! 7 years later, that is... \n\nAlright, so the MAJOR issue I had with TMobile is either their phones or network suck! I don't care at this point to find out which one it was as I am happily back with Verizon. I got mislead a million times by customer service because they wanted me to stay with a windows based operating phone for some reason. Either way, something was not right and they couldn't resolve my issue over a 2 year span worth of my patience! That's ridiculous in itself! \n\nSo If you have a few minutes, I'll tell you all a little story. Go ahead, grab a snack and an ice cold refreshment and take a seat. I'll wait for you to get back... \n\n2 years ago I had a phone that was giving me problems. I had had that phone for about a year. After a couple of replacement phones, they recommended I upgrade; especially for what I mainly needed my phone for (I do Real Estate, need web access, etc.) and I needed to catch up with the times anyhow so I was cool with that. I ended up getting the most expensive phone they had at the time (HTC Touch Pro 2). Cool phone when it worked but I ended up going thru 5 master resets and 8 (YES, I SAID EIGHT!) replacement phones in one year! And the crappy part is, they had just come out with the HTC HD2 a month after I bought that phone and it was a million times better AND about $100 cheaper!!! Were they gonna tell me this?! NO! Would they let me swap phones because I was an awesome, very patient and one of their coolest customers? HELL NO!! I was stuck with a crappy phone and all the problems it had for over a year before I had to threaten to leave! FINALLY, they upgraded me to the HD2. And guess what??? Yep, again, you guessed it... After a month of trying it out, it started up again. The problems were continuing and they wanted to do the replacement thing. All the customer service people were astonished by the encyclopedia size notes that were noted on my account for the past 2+ years yet they can never manage to satisfy my cellular needs :( The Loyalty Dept (aka: Retention Dept) was the worst! Supposedly they have magical powers and can make things all better so that everyone's happy again! Nope, they would insult me with crappy offers that would make the average person wanna strangle their necks thru the phone! Not to mention that for the last few months I was with them, it would take (and this is no exaggeration) a minimal of 45 minutes on hold before I could get to someone! DID THEY KNOW I WAS CALLING AGAIN?!?!?! 45 effin minutes!!! MINIMUM!!! \n\nThe best solution they had was for me to upgrade AGAIN to a Android operating system (thanks for the late recommendation, 2 years later!) phone with a 2 year contract when I was on a month to month plan. With all the issues I was having and problems I went thru and inconveniences, etc, I voted against that thought. If I was to sign another contract, it was not going to be thru them! I was not going to be \TRAPPED\"""" for 2 years after what I wen thru. 7 years of my loyalty down the drain because this is how like to show loyal customers they are appreciative. \n\nI love my Droid X! It does everything I ever wanted and more! Thanks Verizon! \n\nThe End \n\n***Da Bafroom: They ain't nun heya"""""""

<review>"""Gross. I-mart has now expanded to include a restaurant just a few doors down from the market. Wise decision, because the market part smells whack. It is pretty obvious and common knowledge that they cut their meat in the back of the store. I suppose the market and restaurant deserve their own review, but I think its the same rating, I'll just merge them.\n\nThe market has your basic Indo-Pak foods. Don't confuse the owner for an Indian or Paki though, he's from Bangladesh. He's an extremely nice guy, but I feel like every since he moved from Tempe, near ASU, his store has just lost substance. If you need to buy substantial amounts of halal meat I suggest you go elsewhere, probably Baiz Market would be a good idea. The meat here is very inconsistent. He's got your basic Shan masala amongst other odd brands. Of course he has asian rice and everything else you'd really expect from this type of store. The mango juices he stocks are weird, but he has some Pakistani soda, Pakola. That's pretty cool.\n\nThe restaurant should be avoided. My fellow Indo-Pak friends rave about this place all the time, but I don't think they know any better. I walked in and the owner was taking orders... I was slightly confused and surprised (today was the first time I went to the restaurant). I thought to myself, \Hey man, he's usually at the store cuttin' my meat, what the heck is he doing here?\"""" He must have made the food, because when he disappeared again he didn't reappear until my food was ready. My friends had bought me a tandoori chicken wrap, I'm being very ungrateful, but it was not enjoyable at all. The naan was obviously microwaved a few seconds too long, because by the time I got to it it was like chewing on plastic. Taking bites out my 'wrap' was just painful. I'm sad because the filling was actually pretty good, but how can you overmicrowave naan to that point? It's like overmicrowaving your hotpocket (just follow the damn directions).\n\nThe owner clearly wants to retire soon, he first moved from the ASU location to a much smaller store, and now he is barely focusing on the store. To make things worse, he decided to open up a restaurant. If you could compare this place to a legit Indo-pak restaurant, it'd be something like comparing Filiberto's to Chipotle. Everyone likes Chipotle, but only some people can stand Filiberto's."""""""

<review>Came here last month with my boyfriend for some sandwiches.  Such...a...disappointment.  As someone who frequents Mill Ave and all of its shops/restaurants/bars often, I often walk past In Season Deli and it's rarely even open.  I thought we had lucked out when we actually saw two people in there so we strolled in.\n\nWe asked for two turkey sandwiches with the works and he also asked for a side of pasta salad.  Now there was only one older woman making the sandwiches, but it literally took about 20 minutes to get our food.  There was literally a fly swirling around their display case of their pastas, puddings, etc.  The lights in the case were blinking the whole time, made it very unappealing.  \n\nNot sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but they didn't even have any of their tables or chairs pulled out for customers, (maybe there weren't any yet that day?) so one of the employees pulled them all out for us and turned the misters on which was enjoyable.\n\nThe sandwiches were nothing special.  Something you would expect to see in a 2nd grader's brown bag lunch.  Regular wheat bread, oscar meyer brand turkey, one piece of lettuce, soggy tomato, mayo, and mustard.  His pasta salad had a film on it from being old, he didn't touch it.  Their sign actually fell off the wall as we tossed our food, it was priceless.\n\nReally wouldn't be surprised if this place closes down.

<review>"""Driven by this restaurant and figured I had to give it a try...and was absolutely disappointed. The owners have done a great job of decorating the interior, and the touches are modern (cucumber slices in the water, service bar, etc)...but for good authentic Thai food, this is not the place. The service staff was two Asian ladies that were very friendly...but with the open kitchen in the back, I could clearly see that the cooks were two Mexican guys. Mexican guys making \authentic\"""" Thai food? Hoping for the best, I ordered the Basil Chicken with vegetables (along with Pad Thai, this is probably the most basic, common Thai dish). However, this was disappointing, as the food lacked Thai flavor, the chicken was overcooked, and instead of having good Asian flavor...was simply spicy. Very disappointed. The Pad See-iew was ok, but acceptable at best. \nPrices are generally $12-18 for dinner menu, so not the cheapest of Thai restaurants. Lunch specials were $8 or so.\nLooking at the menu, definitely an interesting menu of salads and soups that sounds good...so if you're someone that thinks Pei Wei is authentic Asian food, this is your spot. Good service, cute decor, great spot for a work lunch. But if you're about the authenticity and quality of the food, try the nearby Thai Lahna or La's Thai."""""""

<review>Normally I would give Melting Pot a 5 star but our dinner tonight was just okay.  Our server was slower then normal.  We know to plan a couple of hours for dining at the Melting Pot...and that is one of the reasons we love it but 3 hours was a bit long. \n\nI could even live with the three hours but what really got me in the end was the dessert...which if you read the reviews is what they are known for.  After much debate we ordered the Turtle fondue.  After placing the chocolate/caramel  mixture on our table I asked about the pecans...which I was then informed by the server...oh we're out of pecans!  REALLY...that would have been good information when we ordered the Turtle fondue.  Then she charged us $2.00 extra for another cheesecake.  Maybe you should have went ahead and gave us the extra cheesecake since you were out of pecans for our TURTLE chocolate fondue. \n\nIt wasn't our first rodeo at this establishment.  We go every year for our anniversary...I think next year we will find a new spot.
</review>
<review>Drinks were good and the service prompt and friendly. Concept has potential with the idea of Asian food in a sports bar rather unique. But the Vietnamese part of the menu disappoints with a sampling of various appetizers providing frozen food aisle quality. There's definitely something fun in a place like this. If the menu aspired to compete at a level closer to food found at various Vietnamese restaurants in Chandler, there would be more temptation to eat here. But from a dining perspective, fusion/confusion may be the takeaway.

<review>GREAT atmosphere. Its fantastic. Good olive oils and some really yummy tapenaudes.\n\nThats about where it ends.\n\nWe ate at the little restaurant inside today. The food was like what you'd expect when ordering from a cafeteria style restaurant. My sandwich tasted like it could have been sitting out for 2-3hrs. I had the roast beef, wife had the BLT special.\n\nBoth sandwiches we found to be very VERY dry. Had to go order some extra mayo to soften them up. They come with some dry kettle style chips.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the sandwiches are served as if we are ordering off the seniors menu. TINY. \n\nWe tried the Gelato. Its Albertos brand so it was fine. \n\nAt $9 a sandwich, I expected better. \n\nI cant honestly find the allure of the food of this place! im sorry but all  of my reviews are 100% honest and we eat out all the time, literally 3-4x a week. I have no reason to leave BS overhyped reviews for restaurants like this. NOT IN THIS ECONOMY.\n\nAlso keep in mind btw, this restaurant does not have servers.

<review>service and quality are unreliable\n\ni went after having given up on paying for haircuts and doing my own hair for several years and found an amazing guy who was very focused, friendly, very good at figuring out what i wanted and what would look good, and i left with a great experience and an amazing haircut. Sadly, you cannot request a hairdresser (as I was rudely told) \n\nNext I got a disinterested girl who seemed like she was trying to get me over with asap (even though it was mid-morning and the place was empty). she didn't smile once and didn't say anything. I got a generic trim that wasn't what i asked for. Thanks for taking the time to bother! I think i'll stick to doing my own hair again.

<review>Gross! I got a combo platter of chicken curry. On the menu it had a red pepper next to it, meaning to signify that it was spicy, but the curry was extremely bland, and it looked like greasy water. I assume that it is because they have such a thin curry that the dish was served in a cup-shaped fried egg roll wrapper. Not only was the sauce a disappointment, but the chicken was extremely fatty. \n\nThe fact that it was a combo platter meant that I also received side dishes... First of all, their fried rice has no egg or veggies in it, so it's just soy sauce-soaked salty rice. The egg roll was okay, although it was the heaviest egg roll I've ever encountered, since it was primarily fried wrapper around meager contents. There was also a side of horribly MSG-laden lo-mein. Finally there were two buffalo wings which I never got to because by that point I was not really wanting to eat any more of their food offerings.\n\nFirst bad meal out I've had in a long time (food-wise, anyway... at least the staff was pleasant). Maybe they have other foods that they are better at making? I don't know, and won't be back to find out!

<review>I liked the old airport better.  I hate large, hard to navigate, walk forever to get to your gate airports.  My parents and I once didn't find each other till an hour after I landed because it was so big and confusing.  My parents always hated that there was ALWAYS construction going on there and it kept changing so you could never be sure the route you took one time would work the next time you went.  It was almost easier to just drive there from San Diego than to fly.

<review>"""I was really looking forward to trying this place out. I love their restaurant ! But I was disappointed. The concept is great ! I love the house rules and the \call us and we'll come get you\"""" . But it is not as charming inside. It was way too bright for a lounge but overall cute space. The drink menu (which you can only order from) is nice but really doesn't cater to those that don't like sweet drinks. I personally will have one , maybe two of the cocktails on the list but then I won't want any more. too sweet, too fancy. I like my liquor simple. Now, if you have a professional mixologist there - wouldn't it be great to tell him/her what I usually drink and they will create a new cocktail for me based on that instead of making me leave the place beacuse I don't like their cocktails? It also takes long for some of the drinks, they should mark those that take 10 minutes to \""""cook\"""".\nOur cocktail waitress was very nice and friendly and the mixologist definitely knows what he's doing. \nThey charge a 20% service fee that our waitress explained to us goes to everybody else and now much to her... NOT okay. Charge me more per drink. Don't charge me %20 service and then I'll have to tip over that.\nOverall I guess good idea, great concept. Wrong execution."""""""
</review>
<review>At least the bar service was good... it's one thing if they're understaffed but when the waitress avoids making eye contact as we're waving our arms (yes we were being rude, it had been over an hour with no service) it is ruder. Communication could have solved this problem. I wish we had left  because the food was gross. The ingredients weren't fresh or flavorful, everything was below average. If I had to go back, I'd only go for happy hour wine.

<review>"""Totally agree with the other reviewers about Einstein's being overpriced. A small coffee alone costs $1.91 after tax and adding cream cheese to a bagel costs more than the bagel itself. Sure, the bagels are pretty good, but this is Mesa, not New York City.\n\nMy real beef with this place, though, is the customer service. Although there are always plenty of people behind the counter, I have waited numerous times in a line that reaches the door. On my visit this morning, I saw a customer walk in, see the line, and turn right back around. Also on my visit today, I tried using a coupon for a \free bagel thin with light shmear.\"""" The picture in-store advertised the bagel thin with pink cream cheese and my kids were excited to get their bagel with strawberry cream cheese (which is also listed as one of their reduced-fat options, which means \""""light,\"""" right?) When I ordered this, however, I was told that this was not possible because corporate is only allowing them to use ONE kind of light shmear for this promotion. Even the general manager refused to make a substitution, while watching my 3-year-old cry with disappointment (I know, it's a little thing, but come on, he's 3.) So congratulations, Einstein's at Gilbert  and  Baseline. You've just made a customer never want to return over your refusal to substitute 2 tablespoons of cream cheese. Do you think that's what corporate had in mind?"""""""

<review>"""I'm sure I will be losing my Duchess status of Spoonz soon.  I have been going less and less over the last couple months, and they are housed on the lobby level of my building.\n\nThe service has been just ok since Vita left.  The owner (female) is really unpleasant and doesn't seem to be happy about being there.\n\nThe Scottsdale panini is decent, although the quality of the chicken seems a little lowered recently.  The owner (male) once told my coworker and I  that they cook the meat offsite and simply heat it back up at Spoonz.  Something about not having a proper oven/grill? \n\nAn ex employee of Spoonz was an incredible pastry chef and made amazing desserts.  Not sure how the treats are now, as I'm skeptical there's a bunch of \boxed\"""" desserts.\n\nFor coffee, I'd rather walk a few hundred yards more for Starbucks.\n\nWow, this review really is quite negative.  Spoonz is good when you're in a pinch downtown.  I doubt people are going too far out of their way to come here."""""""

<review>"""Wow! I can't believe this place gets so many good reviews. \nI was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you don't even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; \white meat chicken\"""" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."""""""

<review>This is hands down the worst Pizza I have ever had. I had to go to Nello's after hearing my boss rave about it. I went on a Saturday night; the place was about 20% full. I ordered a sausage, onion and greenpepper thin crust. My first clue that this experience was taking a turn for the worse was when the pizza arrived with the toppings on top of the cheese. Maybe that's why there was no taste. Not even the seasoned pepper's flakes could bring this pie to life. The sausage was nasty. In summary, Nello's was brutal.

<review>You most likely will not agree with us on this one but that's OK and I say that because of the Yelp Rating and the crowd I saw while dining here my Yelp is being based on two lunches .\n\nAs soon as we were seated we received a bowl of chip crumbs that were dripping with oil and a small dish of what I think was sweet and sour sauce the color was  red .\n\nNext came our cup of soup and we both picked Egg Drop the soup was actually very good and fresh and  that made me think our meals would be great !\n\nSoon our meals came and they were VERY LARGE and also came with egg rolls and fried wantons both were fried to a cigar color I didn't eat them and steamed white rice (the rice was good) But my meal called Amazing Chicken had this sauce on it that tasted like sweet and sour sauce mixed with wing sauce and I tried to eat it but after a few pieces I lost my appetite and it is a shame because the vegetables were fresh and nice , the chicken was tender juicy not spongy it was cooked nice but that sauce killed the dish for me .\n\nMy husband didn't care for the sauce that came on his lotus dish but I think he didn't care for the fried rice even more because he thought it was rice with basically just soy sauce . \n\nNobody checked on us .\n\nWhen the busboy noticed our pushed away plates he didn't even ask if I wanted to take it with me...guess he knew I didn't

<review>Like all Fox restaurants (except the new Culinary Dropout at Scottsdale Waterfront), this resturant is just ok, but not great. Starting with the decor, the restaurant is light and airy, with huge windows and lots of patio seating, which is nice. However, the decor reminded me more of a yacht club in the Hamptons than a spot in Mexico. Another big plus is that the hostess (who was friendly and upbeat) gives you a white or black napkins, depending on what you're wearing. I know this seems like a small thing, but if you've ever been given a white napkin while wearing black pants, you'll know the anguish it causes.\nTo the food: As I said above, the food is good not great, but like all Sam Fox restaurants, its overpriced. Its not offensively bad, but its not Arizona mexican. There is just no excuse for serving mediocre Mexican food in Arizona, and this is the reason why I would not recommend Blanco. There are tons of great places in this city to try for upscale Mexican food- Barrio Cafe, and Gallo Blanco are my favorites. The salsa was the worst offender. Serving salsa that tastes like Pace Picante canned salsa is not only unforgiveable, but sets the meal off on a bad foot.\nTry again Sam Fox.

<review>This review is for Terminal 2  - otherwise known as the 9th level of hell.  \r\n\r\nSky Harbor has several terminals and I have always passed through the main (America West) terminal in my travels to and from Phoenix.  It can get crowded, but hey, it's an airport.  Get used to it.\r\n\r\nTerminal 2 however, 'home' to Continental and United Express flights, is the most abysmal place I've seen in a long time.  The 'security' guard I had to pass in order to get to the metal detectors was more interested in her split ends than in looking at my photo ID or checking that it actually matched the name on the ticket.  The Express flight gates are all housed in a small separate building that one must walk through an outdoor area in order to reach.  The entire terminal smells vaguely of mildew and disuse.  And all but one of the eating establishments is either boarded up or roped off and the place that is open...ewww.  \r\n\r\nI ordered a pastrami and swiss from the less-than-friendly counter person and after discussing the appropriate change I should have received back for my $20 bill, I traveled down the smeared glass to pick up my to-go sandwich.  Which had morphed into ham.  I didn't order ham. Well the ticket says sandwich special and that's ham.  Excuse me, but your board says 'special Pastrami and Swiss or Ham and Swiss' and I did not order ham - I don't EAT ham.  Sandwich maker goes down the line to have discussion with counter-person.  I wait.  Impatiently.  I am exceedingly hungry as well as minorly hung-over and I just want my * and $%(#$ and   food.  Finally, I get my pastrami and swiss on (grudgingly admitted) good rye bread.\r\n\r\nOne star for the friendly sky-cap who took my luggage (OUTSIDE the terminal) and one star for the good bread.  Otherwise, if you must travel through this airport, take America West.

<review>"""Possibly the worst pizza and wings I have ever had! Ok, listen, I know Iarrived about 5 min before they closed their kitchen but I called about 15 min earlier and phoned my order for pickup. This still doesn't excuse them for selling crap. The pizza was super thin with virtually no sauce or crust. I know NY pizza is kinda supposed to be thin but \common man\""""! Even the ingredients were terrible. Low quality bread cheese n pepperoni. I really honestly feel that a Tony's frozen pizza from the super market would have been better. The wings were overcooked, sauceless and very very salty. The only reason I did not take this stuff back is because they were about 4 miles away and my brother n I were very hungry. I come from Los Angeles and I have only been in AZ for a little over 1 month but so far my experience with pizza hasn't been great. This place should be ashamed to serve the crap they do. I never even write reviews good or bad but they got me to actually write one. I would have rated negative stars if I could... SMFH!! I will neva, eva, evaevaevaevaevaevaevaeva.... come here again! Go to Oregano's instead. It's like night and day even though you have to wait forever, it's well worth it."""""""

<review>"""First impression, the place looked really nice.  It smelled authentically Chinese too.\n\nBut ultimately it's about the food and that's why it gets 2 stars.  Small portions, high prices and frankly, weak food with poor service are a bad combo.\n\nThe Kung Pao was unlike any I've had before.  Hard, small, dry, fried bits of chicken with some peanuts and a half pound of dried red peppers with no sauce and no veggies was somethng I'd not like to have again.  \n\nThe black bean chicken, had no veggies and the sauce was thick and gelatinous; almost slimy.  In fact it was so gelatinous, after a few minutes it actually acquired the semi-solid jiggle of actual Jello. \nIt should be called corn starch chicken, not black bean chicken.\n\nThe service was uncomfortable and odd.  It was a farily dead Sunday afternoon,  yet the bartender dropped and broke three items at 3 different times while we were there.\n\nSomeone, a manager looking guy, was yelling from the kitchen to the bar (all the tables are located in between there) asking who had his Sharpie.\n \nMy daughter asked if she could substitute plain noodles for rice with her kids meal and the waiter just said \No.\""""   Then later he mumbled some comment about \""""everything being pre-portioned\""""\n\nPre-portioned?  Is this just microwave food?  A Chinese place that doesn't have any \""""unpackaged\"""" noodles??\n\nAt $55 for 2 chicken entrees,  2 dinky kids meals and 2 iced teas with nothing else, I was robbed!\n\nThen my biggest pet peeve- the 20 minute disappearing act after they cleared our plates and we confirmed we didn't want anything else. Meanwhile the waiter walked around looking busy and doing nothing while avoiding eye contact and not giving us our check.\n \nHonestly, It just made me crave some superior Chinese fare, along the likes of Panda Express. \n\nPei Wei and Changs? You can laugh this challenge off."""""""

<review>Can i just say, i hate everything about this store. If youre too lazy to go to goodwill and dig it out yourself for a third of the price, then i guess this is the place for you.  \n\nIf you are trying to sell anything, good luck.  Their askew sense of fashion will make most of your goods obsolete unless its tacky 80's regurgitation.  The chick actually told me that the band t-shirts i was trying to pawn were too outdated while i had a bay city rollers  and rockos modern life shirt in my hand off their rack.\n\nThey are incredibly overpriced, the staff has an elitist air for some reason (which you think would be hard to pull off in a tutu, leggings, and cowboy boots).\n\nSaving grace, they have some killer old punk and skateboarding t-shirts on the cheap for guys and gals. But the only time i even go here is when the boyfriend decides to go thru eastside records vinyl catalog in its entirity. \n\nits like a plato's closet for lady gaga.

<review>"""OVERPRICED  and  DECEITFUL  and  RUDE!\n\nI should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much. I asked her, how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be \much\"""". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, can't even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said it's because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!\n\nPreviously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. They're also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!"""""""
</review>
<review>After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\n\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\n\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\n\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\n\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \n\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.
</review>
<review>In an effort to start on a positive note, I will say that this place has a nice atmosphere. It's a very open space and I could see myself enjoying a beer on the patio during happy hour...if only the happy hour prices were desirable enough to prompt a return visit.\n\nThis is not a place you want to visit with intent to enjoy Vietnamese food as it is overpriced and for lack of better words...gross. The roll we ordered for an appetizer was okay, but the serving size was shameful considering the price, and the peanut sauce I requested on the side was very watery. Pho was the man dish, and it wasn't any better. In fact, it was worse. And with fake meat and funky flavor, it was left unfinished.\n\nIt makes me sad to think that someone may have their first Vietnamese dining experience here and potentially never eat it again as a result. I hope the owners consider sprucing up their recipes, or if nothing else dropping the 2nd half of their name, so that patrons visiting with the intent to dine on Vietnamese Cuisine won't be left disappointed.

<review>Why bother? My only question I have for the owners of this place. \n  Out of pale ale, out of IPA, doesn't offer growlers to take out their beer, employees could care less if you were in there (and we were the only ones in there). Cute Marketing approach with all the Dog names, Dog bone shaped platters to hold the tester beers and TV with rotating dog photos....but you forgot to MAKE the BEER for people to buy and drink!!\nWho runs out of Pale Ale and IPA?  \nSorry but I think we will soon be calling this place Dead Dog Brewery.

<review>I'm done with this place.  We went here last year and 2 days later I got a call from my CC company that my number was compromised and I was able to narrow it down to this place.  We tried to go here last Friday but gave up after having to listen to the manager and bartender argue with a customer about his takout order.  I can't stand restaurants that argue with customers.  There are far too many burger spots popping up around town to deal with these guys.

<review>I went here to buy some pan de sal and empanadas and they were horrible! The pan de sol tasted like it was made dayyyyyyys ago, not fresh at all. The empanadas looked like like they were going to taste good, but the crust was so hard! I had to break it off to get to a decent part I could actually chew, but after a few bites I spit it out. Yes, it was that bad. I will never go back here again.

<review>Pita Jungle in general gets 4 stars, this location gets 2. This location at night is packed. The tables are always so close together and they pack 3 million people in a relatively small area.

The food is phenomenal, but try the Mesa or Gilbert location.

<review>"""Worst. Mexican. Place. Ever. \n\nThis was the most over-priced, crappy food I have ever eaten in the Phoenix area. \n\nWhen you walk in it looks legit and even smells pretty good due to the wood they use to smoke some of their chicken. Once I opened the menu, I could not believe it. I think the cheapest dinner item was over $16. I tried the carnitas, a Mexican staple and something I usually enjoy. Not this time. In one word BLAND. No seasoning whatsoever. No salt. No pepper. No lime. Nothing at all to make this meat taste decent. It was tender, I will give them that, but it was more like jello than pork. The texture was pretty gross. We also had to pay extra to get tortillas with the carnitas. Who the hell does not serve tortillas WITH their carnitas? Seriously....\n\nThe black beans were okay, the only part of the meal I could actually stomach. The rice was crunchy and bland. The salsa was bland and watery. Also, no refills on the salsa... Cheap bastards charge me over $16 for BLAND CRAP and cannot even fill up my salsa for free?\n\nThe service was bad, slow and aloof. \n\nI would rather eat at one of the \bertos\"""" instead of this crap hole.

<review>"""My wife and I flew from upstate NY to San Juan PR for our cruise.  \n\nOur flight from Albany NY left at 5:15am.  We are constantly bombarded with:  \Get to the airport 90 minutes before departure!\"""".  We got there at exactly at 3:45am and....just a big line of people waiting.  Evidently US air doesn't open until 4am.  There were 3 US Air flights that morning, all before 5:30!  How about organization of US airways?  How about opening ON TIME!??!\n\nThen we got to Philadelphia.  Checked the gate number on the big board.  Gate A21. Had to take a bus to a terminal A.  Checked the gate number on the big board again.  Gate A21.  As we are walking to our gate (15 minute walk), I hear something about a San Juan, US air gate change.  Check the gate number on the big board again.  Find out it's B33.  Which is a 20 minute walk in the other direction!\n\nGet to B33 and it's a zoo.  Evidently other people magically got the memo that it's B33, not A21.  I'm in shape but I nearly ran for 30 minutes with heavy carryons and just made the initial boarding call.  Had I walked, i would've missed the flight.  How about US Airways giving connecting passengers some notice?!??!  I nearly missed this flight!\n\nThen I hear some announcement about an aircraft change and the flight being overbooked and offering a $300 credit for your next flight with US airways.  And then moans and groans.  Then I can't hear the rest of the announcement.   Followed by passengers getting confused and angry (by their reactions).  \n\nThen it's a game of \""""Broken Telephone\"""" as the message spreads:  The new aircraft is smaller.

About 60 people just had their vacations ruined.\n\nPositives were that they didn't call out zones:  just as long as you didn't have a G or H seat, you were golden.  And they didn't offer the credit card with 40,000 on the flight either.  I guess the pilots knew that everyone was a bit miffed because we were 30 minutes late coming out of the gate and magically got there in time.\n\nNegatives about US airways (other than above):  No on-flight entertainment.  They had TV's because that's how they did the safety instructions.  But no TV, no movies.  I knew they had them because it started for a couple of seconds (30 Rock) but THEY SHUT THEM OFF!  No Satellite radio either!!!  THEY SHUT THEM OFF AFTER PULLING OUT OF THE GATE and NEVER TURNED THEM ON DURING FLIGHT!

And maybe a little big city attitude adds to the ambiance. But is it necessary to provide such rude counter service? Maybe it's cultural? Maybe this place is owned and operated by the \""""Soup Nazi\"""" from Seinfield? \n\nI tried to place a big order for my mother-in-law's birthday party. I wanted mini deli sandwiches, mixed fruit salad, chocolate covered strawberries, and mini cupcakes. The guy at the counter told me, in no uncertain terms, that I had it all wrong. You don't want mini deli sandwiches; you want whole ones, cut in half. You don't want mixed fruit salad, you want crudit\u00e9, you don't want chocolate covered strawberries, they're too messy and expensive, you don't want mini cupcakes, and you want a regular sized cake. Really??? Then he quoted me a ridiculously high price. So what did I do? I politely told him that I'd think about it and quickly went to nearby Fry's (grocery store) and placed the exact order I wanted. I admit that Fry's catering food was a (smidgen) below the deli quality. But given the greatly reduced price (half?) and the customer service, I'm gonna stick with Fry's Food Stores. \n\nGuess it's a good thing I didn't try to order soup for the party.

As a someone who's traveled in Thailand, and loves good Thai, I was disappointed in the food.  \n\nBoth the fried rice on my husband's dish, and the stir fried noodles in my selection, had a strong, fishy smell and taste.  Neither of us finished our meal, it was that bad.  The waitress did offer to bring us something else but we declined, suspecting everything would have the same flavor.\n\nOn a positive note, the dumpling appetizer was tasty, well prepared and presented with color.

However, this guy had no intention of buying me any drinks, and rather than quash an incredibly awkward situation, the waitress simply told me, \""""Well, I already put it on his tab. Maybe you can buy him a drink to even it out?\"""" Lovely suggestion, but way to not have any regard for the social discomfort you've caused me.\n\nBeyond that run-in, this place is just a nightmare.

<review>We stopped in on a Friday night so I would not have to cook. I ordered the Roasted Turkey dinner with stuffing, mashed potatoes and cranberry. What they brought me was awful!! The first bite I had was a really  bad tasting meat with a greenish/yellow gravy. I had to spit it out in my napkin. The waitress was extremely nice and so was the manager and they did take it off of my bill, but I would have to say there is nothing homemade about this family restaurant. It was obvious that everything was from a can. The cost of our bill was too high for the quality of food. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place and we won't be coming back. It is really a shame that there isn't a good neighborhood restaurant in this area where someone can get some home cooking. I never expected it be gourmet, but seriously...this bad?

<review>This place was a total waste of time.  My friend and I did a long bike ride, and found ourselves craving burgers.  We considered our options, and decided to go with Five Guys because it was close to my house, would give us  a chance to check out Cityscape, and our president famously ate there shortly after taking up residence in the White House.  I am SO not impressed.  I ordered the little burger, which is a single patty, and the fries.  I got way too many fries, and there wasn't any ranch dressing evident into which I could dip them.  So, I was not inclined to eat my fries at all.  The burger was ok.  The big sacks of potatoes in the middle of the restaurant was not appealing (pun intended).  The place was noisy; the music was too loud for conversation.  And the Cityscape development is lame.
</review>
<review>Uninspiring. Good location though, right down the street from the game stop where I took my son before coming here and surprise surprise half the people I saw at the game stop were here which allowed me to further cement my point. See, if all you do is eat crap and play video games all day you will end up like all the fat losers in this place. Menu was extremely limited. Better like canes sauce or ketchup because those are your choices. The Cole slaw was sloppy and smelled and tasted like it was made with elmers glue. The chicken was freshly cooked though....

<review>Need more front office staff! Horrible customer service both on the phone and in person.  Both my appointments were 30-60mins late. One of my appointments they told me they were running about 1 hour behind. One person waiting told me that he was waiting 1 hour for just to get heartworm medicine. Everyone waiting seems really annoyed and you can tell they have been waiting a long time or they have not even been helped at all.  \nMy 2nd appointment I refused to wait 1 hour past MY appointment time. I told the front office lady that I was not able to wait. She was very smug with me and told me there was nothing she could do. So I walked out. \nMy first appointment my dog need to get some stitches out so whisked her away leaving me in the waiting area and in 2 mins brought her back and said they took them out saying everything looks good. There was no talking to the veterinarian. Is the veterinarian even looking at my dog??? I dont care how small my dogs cut is Im paying you $300 for all my visits and for a VET! Especially running a hour behind yup dont think she looked at him. I was really annoyed. \nThe staff seems like they over book patients (obviously) and I see all the parents in the waiting area. Doesnt seem to be any use of the exam rooms or interaction much with the veterinarian from what I see. \nI am disappointed  because this vet is close to the home but I much rather drive twice as far to have a on time appointment with a nicer more personable staff. \nI DO NOT recommend Banfield Hospital especially the one in Surprise. \nI will def be finding a nice neighborhood vet!

<review>We've eaten here twice, and while we enjoyed our meals, we will not go back.  The service was slow both times, and during our second experience it took two and a half hours from the time we sat down until we left -- and  they neglected to give us their complementary signature cotton candy, which we decided against mentioning for fear that would add thirty minutes to our detainment.\n\nSimilar experiences were reported by friends who had the kitchen under then overcook some fish.  An apology pasta dish to tide the diner over made it's way onto the bill.  \n\nWhile I really want to help keep our independent restaurateurs in business, I'd rather spend my money at Tuck Shop than here.

<review>"""SHADY! SHADY! SHADY!!!!!\nMy friends car broke down and it was towed there. They were supposed to diagnose thye problem. They told her the alternator was bad and it would be $600 to replace it. The next day they called her back and said it would be $800. Thinking it was really high she asked my advice. I told her to call the place I go to. My mechanics quote was half the price. She informed Greulich`s that the car would be towed to a different shop to have the repair done. They told her the car was \in pieces\"""" and it would be $400 to put it back together. She found the part online and they will install it for $250. How is $250 to install an alternator but $400 to put the car back together for her to take it to another shop?!\nDon`t let these guys near your vehicle!"""""""

<review>"""This place sucks.  I didn't even go to the concert I had purchased tickets for - because I had really just wanted to see the opening act.  \n\nUnfortunately for me, the opening acts changed and I was never notified- even though I had purchased the tickets via the website and they had my email address.  The night of the concert I realized the band I wanted to see wasn't playing and basically- the people at the box office told me \tough shit\"""".  I talked to someone on the phone, and after the woman I spoke to treated me like crap, I went to the venue and another woman at the will call window treated me like crap too.\n\nThey both cut me off, told me too bad and recited something like \""""you bought the tickets for the headliner, not the opening act\"""".  Which very well may be true, but their attitude sucked.  It sucked so bad, I would NEVER GO BACK.  Not even if Madonna played there and it was her last concert ever.\n\nAnd I love Madonna.  Luckily for me, I contacted the band I wanted to see on myspace, and the band Manager emailed me back right away letting me know they would put me on the guest list for any concert I wanted to see them at."""""""

<review>Phoenix (PHX) is my most dreaded lay-over airport.  It is the last airport I want to find myself when enduring a delayed flight, missed connection, or inexplicable airline misfortune.  The restaurant selections are limited.  The available stores are few and far between (especially, if you need to pick up a spare power cord or other electronic device).  Power outlets are a rarity.  Internet connection is sporadic and sparse.  There is simply no refuge when you just want to escape.  Let's hope this is the last.  Particularly since I hope to never fly US Airways again.

<review>The rooms and the property are GORGEOUS!  Lots of local wildlife to see.  Polite enough staff, though one of the valets was a little rude and yelled at me when I opened my car door to wave to someone I was meeting telling me to stay with my car.  But I was quickly over that.  I have a greater issue with the Talavera restaurant on the property.  \n\nThe restaurant is over designed to the point it insults the guest.  The eclectic old southwest look is nice to look at but they completely forgot about function!!  Case in point is that all of their tables have a HUGE bulky pedestal base. This base means that if a lady is wearing a fitting dress or skirt she has to sit very far back from the table and is banging her knees into the awful thing.  Another option is to hike the skirt way up and straddle the thing.  Either way it is uncomfortable and not what you expect when you spend $50+ per plate.  The menu is handed to you on a wooden plank that is awkward to handle.  Plates, serving cast iron pans, faux-recycled (look it but are not) butter dishes and everything else at this place is all style and no substance.  Just plain awkward and uncomfortable.  When you are here you really just want to finish up and leave.  \n\nThen on to the food.  The food is completely uninspired.  I would expect some local flavor but there was none.  It is steaks and seafoods which are ok. with side dishes that are completely insulting.  They combine a bunch of fancy sounding stuff but the outcome is a barely palatable failure.  Their corn side dish was served semi cold and tastes like it has lemon in it.  Actually I think lemon is probably the secret in everything.  I have had cilantro lime roasted corn before and that was spectacular.  This lukewarm, not really roasted corn with lemon juice and maybe some olive oil or something on it was mediocre at best.  The flat iron steak was fine but not spectacular.  The kale side was sour and not good, also served fairly cool.  Their rolls were served hot and those were tasty though they would have been better off making the butter salted butter rather than sweet butter with huge salt chunks which were again just awkward.  \n\nI'm not trying to nit pick but truly when I say awkward, I'm trying to highlight how this combination of awkwardness makes the dining experience less than spectacular and came across as almost insulting.  As if the kind of people who stay at this kind of resort are so stupid that you can throw anything with a fancy name at them and they are supposed to rave about it.

<review>I won't ever go back to this place!\n\nI was looking for a steakhouse to take my friend out for her birthday.  I wanted to take her to some place nice with good food.  My friend let me pick a spot so I said lets go to the Keg at Tempe Marketplace because we both drove by so many time but never tried it out.  \n\nWhy two stars? The first one is for the setting!  I love the look because it is soooo cozy- i felt warm right when i first got in.  The second star is for the clean/smell really good bathroom!  \n\nThe food:  besides the bread and butter- I got a New York and my friend got a Top Sirloin-  the New York was very salty and the Top Sirloin- well I can get a better steak at Apple Bee's.  \n\nThe service was ok- it was not bad nor superb.

<review>Response to Rob C: I wasn't offered anything from any other restaurant. You got this review because I've eaten WAY better Greek than what you serve. You just trashed any chance you had of repeat business from me too, as I was -planning- to come back and try some more meat-oriented stuff as has been suggested. Incidentally, I could have sworn I wrote a review of Greek Wraps already, but looking through all the reviews (even the filtered ones) it seems I haven't. They obviously didn't pay me enough eh? (snort)
</review>
<review>I would never visit this location again. \n\nThere meat portions are horrible. It is like they are being paid to skimp on the meat serving. Each time I have gone, you have to order double meat just to get a full scoop. \n\nI like Chipotle, and this is convenient for me which is why I have gone, but after this most recent visit I will drive to a different location even if it is further for more quality.\n\nAlso, they are always backed up with a long line.\n\nI would recommend the Alma School location. They are fast, food is much better portioned, and staff has always been friendly.
</review>
<review>"""So, I have been to Pearl a few times now. The first time, it was ok, nothing spectacular but I liked the prices. The 2nd time- horrible. The spicy tuna roll tasted very strong, like fish that was NOT fresh at all. The other rolls we got were falling apart. The service was crappy.\nWelllll, I decided to give it another try because I had a certificate from restaurants.com for there. So, I grab 2 of my friends and we head that way. We sit down, one friend goes to the restroom. I am sitting with a friend from Chicago who has never been there so she has no idea what they are about. A girl walks over with the 3 menus they have (sushi, appetizers, and drink menus). This girl HAS TO BE either drunk or stoned... She asks if we have been there before and I let her know I had but my friend was new. She then says that she is just helping, not our waitress, and if our waitress doesn't explain the menu, I can....what???! So, she wants ME to explain the menu to my friend??? Weird. Anyway, finally our server comes, we order 2 miso soups and an edaname. The stoned girl who is \helping\"""" brings 1 soup and the edaname. I politely say that we had an extra soup when she had a chance...She then looks at me strangely and asks \""""Did you order it with your server?\""""....Really??? So, we order our food, one friend orders a beer. The beer comes out with ice in it?? The food comes....horrible. The fish is very strong again. I got yellowtail and it was very mushy and tasted suuuper fishy. My friend had a shrimp tempura roll that fell apart everytime she dipped in soy. I couldn't even eat mine... finally we want the bill. Server is no where to be found until we see her chatting with another table. Fine, thats her job to be friendly...15 minutes later we ask the bartender if we can get our tab and he acts like we are being jerks. Moral of the story...Pearl Sushi, I gave u 3 chances... thats enough. Get some fresh fish... I know your menu is cheap, but I'd rather pay more for good fish. Also, get some servers who are a little more professional and experienced. And do some drug tests while you are at it."""""""

<review>I walked in and I was immediately digusted by this place. Want a crap load of peanuts? No seriously, when you walk in there is a huge bushel of peanuts, and you can get as much as you want! Done with the shells? Just leave them on the table then brush them aside. The end result? A restaurant with peanut shells all over the place. Actually, to be quite honest, I'm being a little harsh here. I thought it was cool that they did this unlimited free peanuts thing, but it was like they were trying to compensate for something else.\n\nWell, when I got my food I figured out what they were trying to compensate for. The salad and 'breadsticks' were just plain bad. However, I didn't really expect much. I was actually hoping my wings would be good and that the salad was just a side. The wings are nothing special at all. I thought the 'El Hefe' wings were somewhat decent, but I don't think I could have more than a half-dozen of those. Hot wings? What hot wings? I thought I ordered some, but maybe the waiter got confused. I got some cold wings with red sauce on them, they tasted 'vinegary' and that's about all.\n\nTo be fair, the service was pretty good and the server was friendly. She was helping us make decisions since it was our first time, but the food was cold on multiple occasions. A previous reviewer mentioned gorgeous staff... Not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food, go to a strip club? Maybe if the food was hot it could be different, but I really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark.\n\nThere is really nothing special about this place. The wings are over priced for what you get, and there is better stuff available 5 minutes away from here. I love wings, and I've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in Phoenix, but I think my search continues for the time being.
</review>
<review>Just when you think it couldn't get any worse! I too went back after I got down the road and realized they missed half the car and there was still bird shit on the window. They were first argumentative and said I should have purchased an upgraded wash if I really wanted a better job than what I got. They said they would redo it giving me a premium wash for no additional cost. I didn't get to excited about the upgrade since this was a 2010 Mercedes and still looked like new on the inside. All I wanted  was a clean exterior. Imagine the horror of getting to the pick up area and finding that they put amorall or a like kind of  dressing all over the dash, speaker grills, vents and door hardware. When I went back to the entry area for now the third time they insisted that they gave me this special treatment as part of their premium wash. I insisted that they remove it and they sent another guy in with a scubbing pad and some unknown solution.  When finished I had a blotchy colored dash with shiny looking areas all over the hard to get to areas. When I talked to the guy that said he was the manager he said he would check with his supplier the following week and see if he could get something to clean up the mess. He said he would call back a week ago. Still no call and a $50,000 car that looks like crap thanks to these people. It's too bad they don't  have a minus five selection here. This is a good place to send anybody that you really dislike.

<review>Horrible management. Lady cashier didn't give me my change . When I  asked about it she said she couldn't remember was her reply. I asked for a Manager. The rudest lady ever she said no way was i gonna get my change, until closing. Manager refused said it's store policy.  I waited for a hour until finally they counted the register found my extra change rudely gave me my change and gave no apology. Rudest people ever i will go to a bigger chain store next time.
</review>
<review>This used to be a really good spot, but it seems to be sliding lately. Staff is so-so, the management I have met is just slightly smarter than livestock. There are two things I can praise. They do an excellent job at being both an upscale bar AND a upscale restaurant, not many places are able to pull that off. Second is the Dj in the larger room where the band preforms, he knows whats up! And yes this place is cougar central, gentlemen watch out.

<review>"""This store is not very good. The only positive is that they have everything out for you to test and play with, and not locked behind glass. So, if you're in the market for a Sony product, you can go here and get the hands-on experience.\n\nHowever, the staff is completely inept. They do try to be nice, but they know nothing about computers. My wife was in the market for a Vaio laptop and had some basic questions to start, a couple of which the manager was able to answer, and most of which I had to find out myself by inspecting the laptops. We targeted the F series because my wife likes to play video games and to be portable. Once the manager got wind that she plays video games, he just kept repeating that they were running Starcraft 2 on one of the F series in the store, as if that's all we needed to hear to fork over $1300.\n\nWe decided to head up to the Microsoft Store to do some comparison shopping. They are very nice up there. They had the previous iteration of the F series in stock for $1000, and the specs appeared to be the same except for having 4 GB RAM compared to 6 GB on the newer model down in the Sony store.\n\nWe went back to Sony to verify what made up the $300 difference on their model, and the manager could not explain the price difference. It appears the newer one had only been redesigned, and had the aforementioned higher RAM. That's not worth $300 though. The manager referred me to another associate he referred to as \the Vaio expert\"""" and drifted away. I guess he'd had enough of us and probably doesn't work on commission. I asked \""""the Vaio guy\"""" if the newer model had faster RAM or a faster RPM hard drive, and his eyes glazed over with ignorance. He said he would Google it for me, and I watched the painful process of someone Googling when they don't actually know what they're looking for. I finally thanked him for his time and asked some follow-up questions I thought he should know: Do they offer an educator discount? He doesn't know. He thinks maybe a student discount, but he doesn't know if and how much. Are any accessories included? He doesn't know. He doesn't think so. I fish for a free laptop case or free mouse or SOMETHING, practically coming right out and saying, \""""I'm giving you plenty of opportunities to sell me but you're not taking any of them, dipstick.\""""\n\nNo dice. I went upstairs and bought it from the Microsoft Store. 10% educator discount, nice. You stink, Sony Style."""""""

<review>I visited Upper Deck on a Saturday of Memorial day weekend during a UFC fight.  We were looking to watch the fight and there were tons of TVs and large tables upstairs so we got just what we were lookin for as far as the sports part goes.  As for the grill part, I'll cut them some slack for me having picked a busy night and weekend, but my drinks took a long time to get there and the second one was wrong.  I would have given a more favorable rating except that the food wasn't great either.  I ordered a philly cheesesteak with potato salad and some wings.  The wings were pretty good but the rest was kind of blah.
</review>
<review>Overpriced, mediocre food in an ice-cold environment.  \n\nI really wanted to like this place - old style, non-pretentious environment ('the un-scottsdale'). But alas, it was freezing cold inside (in November, when I went - wasn't even that hot outside, so why the A/C had to be on full blast is beyond me. \n\nBoth our dishes were just ok ... not worthy of the price. Has a clearly loyal, regular crowd, which is nice - definitely a 'well known' secret.  But I won't be back.
</review>
<review>"""I have to jump off the Over Easy bandwagon unfortunately. I have eaten there a few times now and it just occurred to me today that I never (and I mean never) have good service. I can make a good breakfast myself if need be and save some scratch.  I go out to eat for fresh hot food and great service. Today my friend and I received neither. \n\nUpon arrival we sat immediately since we arrived before 8. We were \greeted\"""" by a server In about 1 min and asked if we were ready to order.  I stated we were not but drinks would be great.  We got our coffee within a few mins (which tasted fine). After that no sign of our server for 10 mins or so.  The table next to us was also looking to order from our MIA waitress.  She finally came over and took our order in a fast and courteous manner. The food arrived in about 15 mins but there was a problem......my friend's biscuits n gravy were barely room temperature.  After attempting to flag down the waitress for a few mins she walked by holding up her finger to let me know to wait min.  I don't know if she was being rude but it came across that way. After telling her the problem there was no apology and she walked away with his plate returning about 10 mins later with a hot plate of food. The food itself was good, but not great in any way. Our coffee cups went empty for long stretches of time and our waffle dogs had no crunch to them whatsoever.  After all that they give me the wrong bill which was about 5 bucks short of what we spent. After running my card they came back and asked for my card again and took about 15 mins to redo the bill and charge us 5 buck more. After the poor quality service I would figure they just let it slide since they made the mistake anyway and it was 5 bucks and not 20. \n\nI feel that there are many places that match the quality of the food at Over Easy and have much better service.  I will no longer eat there."""""""
</review>
<review>"""Still in search of a good breakfast place in Scottsdale, and the Breakfast Joynt left a lot to be desired. First the service was slow but friendly, and because I pay the bill I appreciated the $1.95 for the large glass of chocolate milk for my son and good size cup of hot chocolate for my daughter. As far as my meal the corned beef beef hash was OK nothing special, the hash browns went from burnt on the edges to barely cooked in the middle, sausage gravy and biscuits were good but would of been a lot better had they been served hot. Everything else was just OK. Don't order the \Almost World Famous Apple Pancakes\"""" don't even call ahead (as they suggest) we ordered them knowing that they would take 30 minutes to prepare, so we all ate breakfast and sampled them after our meal. It's just a big bowl of cooked custard with apples. absolutely NO flavor. Don't waste the time or your money."""""""

<review>I will start by saying that I normally LOVE Pita Jungle, so it disappoints me to only give this Downtown location 2 stars.\n\nWith 2 kids (under 3) in tow, I was meeting my best friend for a quick lunch downtown. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and keep my kids happy. It took almost 15 minutes for a server to even acknowledge me - despite my telling the hostess after 10 minutes, and trying the flag down the server who kept going out of his way to ignore me. Finally I was able to flag down another waitress, and give her our full order, so that it would arrive by the time my friend got off work.\n\nThe lunch rush was over, so I didn't expect our food  to take longer than 15 minutes. We ordered a fruit salad (the Carribean), a Lavosh Chicken Schwarma Wrap, and a kids meal. THIRTY minutes had passed and our food was still not out. My friend literally had 10  minutes to eat before she had to be back in court.\n\nThe only thing they were quick about was taking my friend's credit card.\n\nThe 2 stars was because the food was delicious as usual, but this was the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant for lunch. So disappointed.\n\nI really hope they step up their game. Next time I will go back to the Desert Ridge or Arrowhead location. Much better service/experience.
</review>
<review>I was recommended this place by a local foodie who is very picky. He swears by the place so I trusted him.\n\nThe location is nice, and pretty cool inside. The menu is impressive and has a lot of cool ideas. The food that I ate however was not any good.\n\nI paid so much to get so little and what little I got was not impressive at all. I was actually embarrassed as I brought a few friends from out of town there and they also thought the food was gross. I felt like they would never trust my judgement again.
</review>
<review>I really hate giving places 1 star reviews, but in this case, it was very well deserved.  We came here around 10 or so and the place was pretty much full, and by full, I mean all 10 or so of their tables were occupied.  Fortunately, there were tables outside, so we grabbed one despite the clouds looming overhead.  \n\nWe sat there for a little while and enjoyed the cooler weather and perused the menus.  I was immediately turned off after noticing that almost everything on the menu contains onions.  Of course you can just ask for them to be removed, but for many people, they simply won't order something because of that.  We sat there for a while and the waitress finally came back to take our drink order, but specifically said we couldn't order our meal yet.  WTF, we're ready, and this is already taking long enough.  When she comes back out, entirely too much later, I ordered the starter which is two eggs, toast, and hashbrowns.  \n\nOnce our order was put in, we didn't see the waitress for another 30 minutes.  This is unacceptable for breakfast.  I was watching the window like a hawk and noticing the awfully slow rate at which food was going out to tables who were there well before we were.  The clouds decided to have some fun with us and began raining.  It got progressively worse until two of the outside tables went inside and stood, waiting for their food.  You'd think they would maybe expedite the food or something.  We stuck it out for about 5 more minutes and then gave up, realizing our food was never coming out.  We paid for the chocolate milk, and left.  The sad thing was, they didn't even do anything to rectify the situation.\n\nThis place is an absolute joke.  If you cannot handle the business you are receiving with the staff you have on hand, you need to hire more.  Not only that, but they need better servers.  The couldn't care less attitude of this place is pathetic.  I don't blame them one bit for the raining, and I certainly don't blame them one bit for being busy.  I do blame them for being careless and quite frankly, terrible at their jobs.\n\nI kid you not, we went next door to the Filiberto's and got breakfast in less time than it took for us to even get our drinks.  Avoid Red Bird Cafe at all costs!

<review>I've been hearing about Tee Pee for years; it's considered a Phoenix landmark, I think!  George W Bush has been there afterall!  But it wasn't until my husband purchased a groupon for this place, that I was forced to go check it out.  \n\nMy quick summary:\n*chips and salsa - meh, nothing special, kind of stale tasting to be honest\n*guacamole - nasty\n*Bud Light - A-OK\n*Chicken Tostada - decent\n*House Salad - decent but simple (it's just lettuce and tomato)\n*Service - friendly and attentive although it did take awhile to get ice water, and when we finally did, we were handed a pitcher and 3 glasses.  I realized it was 3 glasses for the 2 of us because 2 of them were stuck together - classic!\n\nBottom line: I don't eat Mexican very often, but when I do, I'll likely go elsewhere.

<review>At first the experience was good. The rep at this company was very friendly and seemed to listen to our needs. After talking to them specifically about the type of dog we have (a Pitbull) and that many management companies don't accept them, we were assured that was not an issue with the property we were looking at. Even their own website said on that property listing (and others) there were no breed restrictions. However after turning in our non refundable app fee, they stated that due to the breed of our dog we were not able to obtain the house...They refused to refund the app fee (due to it not being refundable) even though they were in the wrong here...they told us before we applied that the dog was no issue..Also not only did they refuse to refund the app fee they didn't even offer to use the files or app fee we paid towards another property application. The manager there tried to tell my roommate that he sits next to his rep and he knows he never said anything like this...ya we wouldn't just make this up also the manager leaves by 5 i think if i remember correctly. Most of the calls we had with the rep were after 6pm. Be very cautious in using this company. I personally don't recommend them due to my experience with them.

<review>"""I've been here once, and I will only go here once. I met my husband and some friends there after work sometime in February, when it was still cold enough at night to require jackets and outdoor heaters to sit outside. We were seated in a dark corner of the patio, where there were THREE portable heaters, none of which were turned on. We asked our ditzy, busty, DUMB waitress FOUR TIMES to turn them on, and she kept saying, \I'll have to ask someone to do it. I don't know how.\""""  I finally asked her WHO she had to ask, and she pointed to the dirty looking guys acting as bouncers at the gate, who apparently are the only ones in the joint authorized to turn on the heat lamps. Fine. I walked over to them and asked if we could get our heaters turned on, and the guy walked right over and did it for us. Took all of 30 seconds. \n\nOh, and it took about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, several of the orders were messed up. And the waitress didn't care. And it wasn't that good. \n\nCan you tell I didn't really care for this place (note my frequent use of all-caps)? And yet it will continue on, because college students will continue to buy their beer and flaccid fries as long as ASU is there.\n\nAh well. We can't all have as refined taste as I.\n\nOK, as long as I'm in pretentious snob mode, I'd like to point out that one of the reviews of this establishment excuses the small oyster portions because \""""we're in a dessert.\"""" Um...stripper jumping out of a cake? Or do you really not know how to spell DESERT?\n\nYowza. I'm usually nicer."""""""
</review>
<review>FIRST--this place does NOT serve authentic Chinese food. If you haven't had the opportunity to try authentic, then you might not know the difference. This is the WORST Chinese food that I have ever had...tasteless and greasy (be sure to bring your Tums or Rolaids).\n\nIf you want authentic, then go to the Gourmet House of Hong Kong on 16th St and McDowell (it's a real dive, but very authentic!) or have Dim Sum at the Great Wall at 35th Ave/Camelback (sadly, the Silver Dragon is gone...)\n\nYou'd be better off eating at Panda Express.
</review>
<review>I would give the service four stars, and the atmosphere five stars.\n\nNow for the rest:   We had a party of 5 and arrived for a reservation at 7:00.  We were promptly seated, the staff was very friendly and helpful.\n\nHad a good start -- the spicy queso was good, but $8.50 was definitely a little steep for a small bowl of melted cheese, and only 1/2 a plate of fried tortilla strips.  We liked our sangria, and our waiter (Josh?) did a great job of keeping an eye on the drinks when they were getting low.\n\nDinner?  YIKES.  I ordered tamales which were.....unrecognizable.  I would describe it more as a plop of cornmeal (no corn husks) with some adobo sauce and shrimp dumped over it.  Not appealing, and very heavy.  \n\nAnother guest found a piece of plastic in his chicken (when he chewed on it).  In their defense, the waiter, the manager, AND the chef came out to profusely apologize.  It was a really nice gesture AND they took $25 off the bill.  Well handled.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I'm not sure I'd go back.  The food wasn't that great, and definitely overpriced for what you get.  Too bad.
</review>
<review>The food was okay, but it is way overpriced for what it is. The server was not very friendly, and she wasn't attentive.\n\nIf that wasn't bad enough, I ended getting FOOD POISONING from this place! When I called to let them know about it the next day, the hostess brushed it off and said that they never have gotten any complaints about food poisoning before. She didn't offer me anything; she didn't apologize.\n\nI already would never have returned to Sushi Brokers after the meal, but after realizing that this place gave me food poisoning, and after they were so nonchalant about it, I don't ever want to see or think of this place again!

<review>"""Rather disappointed. Was looking forward to going here on a Saturday Night as we were meeting a group old friends and had never been. Heard good things about the joint and had watched the review on PBS some time ago. \n\nFirst off, the bartender needs to learn some social skills, as well as, a refresher on some of the basics. Sat down and took over 5 minutes to greet us - there were total of 5 people at the bar. Gave us a drink menu then took a full 10 minutes to come back. Really? Wasn't like he was doing anything important, just casually chatting with some customers while we wait dry and parched. Sorry to interrupt your conversation but Alcohol sales are waiting over here sir! He wasn't fully knowledgeable about the liquors the establishment offers either. How about a cocktail napkin for the sweaty beer - they were 6 inches from where he set the glass down. In fact no one had cocktail napkins; just plain lazy. He never checked back with us either or asked for food sales. I had to flag him down to order appetizers. Never came back either, we ended up just leaving and going to the table. I hate that \Scottsdale Bartender\"""" mentality of it seemingly being a favor to serve you. Don't flatter yourself lazy bar-keep. \n\nThe wait staff is mature and knowledgeable. Out gal was quirky and funny - we liked her personality. She dropped the ball a few times on beverage service though. Thirsty 12-top of people waiting for drinks decreases your sales and inevitably your tip as the check is smaller. Big hint: Six chicks at the table, you might want to suggest desserts as they WILL order them, but won't if not asked. \n\nFOOD:\n\nStarted with Hummus app and pot-stickers. Nothing to write home about and presentation was plain generic. Pot-stickers were on the cold side too. \n\nI ordered a Caesar salad sans the croutons with extra dressing and extra cheese. Came out w/o the extras and was quite dry. Had to ask for more dressing which was brought out. This might be picky but I like my Caesar tossed so it's even and not dressing poured over the top. The big kicker for me was the abundance of giant leafy romaine tops. A Caesar should be the hearts of romaine and chopped - not the other end of the leafy bush as it's too bitter. It was not enjoyed. \n\nI ordered prime rib since we're in a steak house right. Ordered it MEDIUM RARE. MR should be red with some blood. The server dropped my plate and ran before comment so I sat there looking at a piece of Medium Well shoe leather. With that said, the 12 dinners came out wildly staggered and auctioned off at the table - real bush league. How difficult are table/seat numbers. \""""Who has the Sole? Who has the Steak?\"""" is so unrefined. Some of the guys at the table were served before their wives and then were patiently waiting to eat until their partner's meal arrived - result cold food. Others were finished with their meal before others even got their entrees. The table service as a whole was disconnected and awkward.  \n\nAnyhow, I had to send back the prime rib as I don't eat shoe leather; especially for like $30 something bucks. It came back and it was MEDIUM not MEDIUM RARE. I'm not one for the double send back as you don't know what might be brought back the third time if you know what I mean. So I pained through it, and pained I did as this Prime Rib was super bland - really disappointing. In fact all of the food was rather bland and in need of seasoning. One other item was a side of this couscous thingy that sounded interesting. It wasn't - it was awful. Crunchy and tasted odd. Now with that said, it very well may be the correct way to prepare this, I don't know, but it tasted like eating raw rice to me. \n\nNo coffee or dessert were offered. I would have ordered a Grand Marnier or a Sambucca if asked as well. \n\nWhat a tasteless train-wreck. I can think of a ton of other places to drop $140.00 in this part of town."""""""

<review>"""BUYER BEWARE! I went to this florist instead of a big-internet \nflorist for a birthday gift last week.  I looked for someone who was close to where I wanted them delivered and looked at the website prior to investing time, looking at the possibilities of flower arrangements for our Mother. \n Sun City  Florists state they are family run and \Because all of our customers are important, our professional staff is dedicated to making your experience a pleasant one. That is why we always go the extra mile to make your floral gift perfect\"""".  Right.\nI felt they would honor  what is stated on the website to deliver a nice arrangement of flowers for a birthday gift.  I ordered a $43.00 arrangement and paid and a $14.00 delivery fee for a total of $57.00.\nWhen we got a call thanking us, mom made note of the arrangement, and she started describing it to me- She told us about the arrangement noting flower types in the arrangement I would NEVER have ordered!  \nWhen it didn't sound like the right kind of flowers (big, light-pink carnations which was most of the arrangement) had been sent, we asked her to send us a photograph. There were about  1/2 the amount of flowers that they actually used in the arrangement compared to the photograph online and it was so sloppy looking, I couldn't believe it.  \nI was horrified that was what they actually sent and couldn't believe they had the gall to charge us $43.00! This arrangement looked like something you could buy at a Safeway store for $9.99.  An ugly arrangement with big, light- pink carnations.\nWhen I called them to tell them how unhappy I was they told me that the time-frame for a guarantee was up.  I ordered these flowers on the 19th and they were delivered on the 20th of Oct.  That's less than a week ago and really beside the point. I told them I had photographs to show them how ridiculously off this arrangement was and they stated they had no email for me to send them the photos.  As a small high-end business owner in San Diego I would never treat our clients this Way!!!!!!  \nOf course the owner wasn't there and hasn't bothered to return a call. If this happened in my business and someone was as unhappy as we are, I would make sure to make it right somehow- I would have rather thrown my money out the window then have Sun City Forists send an ugly, sloppy, cheap looking arrangement to my mother.\nShame on them.  They made sure to tell me on the phone they have a good reputation -\nI don't know how if this is how they treat customers and overcharge for crap at the same time. NEVER AGAIN."""""""

<review>A very odd experience.  \n\nWe entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well, yes but she took us out the back door of the restaurant, to the back door of the bar.  Once there I started to get nervous.  A line of 4 or 5 people waiting to get in met by two security people checking Identification.  \n\nOnce you show the security people your ID, they then put a wrist band on you.  I am pushing 50, but perhaps without the wrist band, someone may mistake me for under 21.  \n\nFinally inside, it was a throw back to some 80's nightclub with old school music and flashing lights and more, at attention security staff.  \n\nThey feature a free happy hour buffet with assorted Mexican food, which was actually fresh and tasty.  Our server was nice and attentive.  \n\nThe entire time we were there, I was worried to why they needed a security team roaming about.

<review>If I could give Burger King no stars I would. I used to love BK but they are skimping so bad now on the quality of there food it tastes like complete crap. I used to stop here on the way home from work and have a double whopper and frys. I really looked forward to it but not anymore. There food went from juicy and good to dried out garbage. I kept going thinking maybe it was just a fluke but it wasnt. It never got back to being what it used to be. Its just disgusting. The flavor has changed, the texture has changed, everything else good has changed. I am done with BK for good. Jack in the Box is always good and you they have a great selection of food. I think I will stick to Jacks from now on.

<review>Our order:\nPork chili verde \nFrench onion burger\n(approx. $25)\n\nI'm pretty dissatisfied. My medium-rare burger came out very rare (cold in the middle). I cut it in half before trying it and sent it back, they put the same burger on the grill and brought it back out. I don't know if that altered the taste any or it could just be in my head but the burger did not seem worth the $12+ dollars. The design of the place is really cool but I'd have to say it was more older people than urban in ambience.
</review>
<review>I had never visited an In  and  Out Burger restaurant and wanted to know what all the hype was about.  So last night, my husband and I decided to try it.  My impression was it is a very clean restaurant with a whole lot of employees who seem to be incapable of performing their job easily or well.  There were so many people behind that counter, most of them just walking around or partnering with another employee.  It was almost overwhelming to see so many workers crammed into that kitchen.  \n\nThe burger itself was okay, nothing special IMO.  I thought the bun was nice.  I asked for the burger itself to be cooked well, no pink.  Well, it wasn't.  It arrived medium well.  The special requests I made were followed except for the cooking temperature.  No fast food burger should be served pink unless requested.  Blech.\n\nThe fries that I have heard folks rave about were just awful for me.  Mine were served room temperature, barely warm.  Greasy, flavorless, and soggy.  Yuk and double yuk.  \n\nMy granddaughter ordered a strawberry shake.  Something happened to the shake machine and they had a terrible time making that little cup of ice cream and milk for her.  When it was finally served, there was way too much strawberry sauce in the drink.  It was horrid.  \n\nI won't go back again because the food was not impressive and neither was the service, despite the many many people working.  The prices were very fair.
</review>
<review>We came here on a Friday night with high hopes with great recommendations from friends. Can we say very limited menu? Looking at the prices, I was expecting a more seasonal selection. Our server took forever to greet us. She barely even knew what the daily specials were! We heard the server at the next table list a couple of specials that our server had no idea about. Umm yeah had to pass on the 32 dollar strip steak special. Had the french dip (17 dollars), which was pretty good. The string like fries were tasty, just a bit salty. For the price and poor service, won't be going back.
</review>
<review>"""Not great compared to a good deli, not good when you factor in the price.\n\nIt was soon after moving here from Los Angeles that I found Chompies.... being a regular patron of West Coast heavyweights such as Langers, and even Canters, I was hungry for good deli food and thrilled... at first.  \n\nTheir food is \meh\"""" at BEST and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY overpriced for the quality.  If they charged 1/2 the price they do currently, this place would be 4-stars.. but don't come up in here trying to charge Langer's prices and serve up Schlotzsky's quality. \n\nNext."""""""
</review>
<review>The food is blah. I ate there for a long time just because it is the closest Asian restaurant, but really the food could be better.... OK, it could be a lot better. A long time ago, I used to love their frog legs, but now they are so bad I cant even tell you. The abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs. I was so disappointed!\n\nThey raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes  and  sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.\n\nAlso, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order.\n\nThe food is inconsistent.  It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse  and  worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken! My friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place.\n\nAlso, They wont give out copies of their to-go menu with the new prices on it. So you kinda just have to take their word for it on the new prices... It used to be a place we went often but it's getting to the point that I'm kinda just over this place.\n\nYah, the more I think about it, I'm way over this place.

Here's a transcript of an email I attempted to send back to them (it was from an automated account) after they, for the third time, sent me the guilded steps for \viewing success\"""":\n\nHi. Thanks for these steps. The thing is I turn all my devices off regularly - probably 2 or 3 times a day - so they're constantly resetting like what you're saying to do in these instructions. And since I have ethernet, only the first 2 steps apply to me, and like I said, they're done on a regular basis, so...although you guys are quick with an answer, I still don't believe it's an adequate one to explain why I, with a premium package from my ISP, 13 mbps download speed, and comparatively little trouble streaming video on most other sites, e.g. YouTube, Digg, Hulu, etc., still continue to have problems loading content on your site.\n\nSince May, I can only successfully watch an entire movie without major interruption approx. 25% of the time. Maybe I should be paying 25% of my monthly bill? Perhaps you guys think we pay relatively little for the great service - and, in essence it is great, or was, for my first few months as a customer. And now, to hear you guys are jacking up your rates, when I'm DEFINITELY not getting what I pay for, I think sucks the big one. I've also had several DVDs that have skipped and been unwatchable also, so here's an idea coming from someone in business development and marketing:\n\n - Skip raising your rates and focus on customer satisfaction first\n-  Hire more (or better) people for DVD inspection/quality control/tech support\n-  Use the billions you must be raking in and get more servers/DVDs to ensure the quality you purport to have\n\nThen you won't take a huge tumble when rate jacking and thumbing your nose at customers causes them to jump ship by the millions in the months and years to come.

<review>"""Long story short , these guys are crooks. Liars. Greedy. Their mothers would be (and probably are) ashamed. If you want , Skip to the last paragraph to spoil the story and find out what to expect when dealing with them.\n\nMy Experience\n\nI had brought my scooter in for a new intake , as mine had just fallen off while driving around town. I didn't think it was a big deal because I knew Performance Scooter was just down the road. \nI putted in and explained my situation to them.  I wanted to know my options. The guy working there told me my scooter was just a pile of crap , and I should buy one of his. And there was really only one option , a cheap knock off K and N filter that they will connect to a piece of rubber they chopped off some other intake that was laying around. For $80.00 installed. I thought this was a good deal , considering any mechanic knows if you change an intake on a motor you will have affected the air fuel mixture , and thus will need to jet the carburetor. I didn't want to spend the time jetting the carb my self , as it would be my first time for this carb/motor and I didn't have a good baseline to start. Also I had to be to work in about 1.5 hours. I accepted the deal.\n  The guy working there told me he had just crashed pretty hard on a scooter and had broken some ribs. So he needed me to install the intake , because he could hardly move. I bolted on the parts he had given me.\n\There! Its going to run much better , and way faster now!\""""  The man said.\n\""""What about all these disconnected , lose , vacuum lines that are just dangling now? What about the jetting? And the cotton air filter is dry , it needs to be oiled!\"""" I replied.\nHis response \""""It doesn't need oil , it doesn't need jetting. Its much better off now.\"""" I argued with him another few minutes , and decided I would leave , and try it out. \""""Maybe scooters are much more simple\"""" , I thought , and went on my way , as I was becoming late for work. \nInstantly I noticed the scooter was running poorly. I used to be able to reach 70mph , and now its topping out at 35 , and its taking forever to even get to 35. I got to work late. That evening after work the scooter would not start.\nI called a friend and trucked the scooter home. In the morning the scooter still would not start. I trucked the scooter back to Performance Scooter. They told me they would look at it and get back to me. \n5 days later they called and said \n\""""I don't know how much money you wanna put into this thing, but you can just buy a new one from me. Otherwise you are looking at $400.00 and I don't even know if that is going to fix it.\"""" \nI told him screw it. Leave it outside and ill pick it up when i get off work. I called my friend again , and trucked the scooter home. I could tell they had actually worked on it. The vacuum lines were all connected , at least. \nI gave up on my little scooter. I bought a new scooter (NOT from Performance Scooter!).\n6 months or so pass. My old scooter is sitting , collecting dust , and spider webs. I had a few days off , and figured I would start messing with the old scooter , kill some time and when its all fixed ill have an extra scoot for a buddy.

<review>Let's just say I felt a little mislead with the business description. We were looking for a hookah lounge that offered a full bar and a patio, when we got there we saw they had a nice patio with comfortable looking chairs however, as for the bar......they did in fact have one.... in the restaurant next door!!! We ended up sitting on the patio of the restaurant (which was very small and lacking any sort of ambience we hoped for) since that was the only place where we could both smoke hookah and enjoy drinks from the bar. The drinks were very over priced at $9 for a Vodka/Cran ( I mean I would expect this from a Scottsdale club). The one brightside to this experience was we found out the restaurant we were sitting at served excellent hummus... We definitely won't be going back for hookah anytime soon however it is possible we will come back to try more of the food.

<review>I used to have really fond memories of this place as a kid. I loved the decor and always thought that every restaurant should serve spumoni upon completion of a meal, but the romance has since ended now that I am an adult. \n\nIn the past year I have found myself here often as a central meeting place that could accommodate a large group. In both of those occasions we had the save server who lacked any ounce of charm in his body and felt way too comfortable with the fact that his gratuity was added into our bill due to size. He was brash and acted annoyed the entire time and despite our size we were pretty low maintenance. \n\nOther than service, the food is doing little to impress me. It has become one of those places where I am never truly satisfied with what I ordered. Because their menu is traditional fare I find myself comparing it to every other Italian place I have been and none of their dishes stand out as the best I have had or even close to it. The portions do not match the price in my opinion and neither does the quality. I just end up walking away from dinner feeling a bit cheated by the entire experience. I wish I could fall in love all over again with this landmark, but it is going to take a lot to win me over.
</review>
<review>This is a very cute place--it's clearly not a chain-restaurant type of place that seems to be so frequent here in Scottsdale.  My wife and I sat outside for dinner this past Saturday night, and with the heat lamp, it was perfectly comfortable.    We really liked the environment--the faux candles (which seriously looked really nice), the flowers, the fire, etc.  \n\nThe food, however, leaves much to be desired.  \n\nI had the mussels, which I found to be not very fresh. Sure, we're miles from the coast, but even in California, we get mussels in from Prince Edward Island, so I just think these were a bit old or worse, not even live.  The broth was tasty, but a bit ruined by the really fishy taste that comes from less than highly fresh seafood.   My wife had the foie gras--overall, it was quite good, but slightly overcooked.  \n\nFor the main course, i had the lamb. I had requested medium rare, and it came back well done--there wasn't a bit of pink in the center anywhere...this was a bit disappointing--a french restaurant that had the temperature way off.  So, i sent it back, and this time, just to be safe, i asked for it to be RARE.  And the second time, there were two pieces of lamb--one piece was cooked rare, but still cold in the middle (so i suspect it was from the fridge before they cooked it), and the other piece was well done again!   It was a bit bizarre and straight out of a Gordon Ramsey Kitchen Nightmares episode.  I mean, seriously, if you've blown it in the kitchen the first time, wouldn't you show a bit more care the 2nd round?!  Use a thermometer like the rest of us!  And to top it off, they didn't even take the lamb off the bill.  Granted, they gave us a free dessert, but in retrospect, a much classier move would have been to take it off the bill, ensure the manager personally apologized AND offer free dessert.  \n\nThis is one of the first times that Yelp has let me down--an average of 4.5 stars usually guarantees something great.  In this case, it wasn't even close.  \n\nDon't even get me started about the wine...and the server's recommendation.
</review>
<review>I came here a few days ago with the wife. We had gone to them when they were in Buckeye and it WAS awesome. Our experience this time was less than stellar.  The dough tasted like play-dough....salty as hell, undercooked and kinda slimy/sludgy in the middle.The toppings (wife had cinnamon and I had green chili chicken) and the mild salsa were the only reasons I could eat a few bites. I ended up scraping it off and throwing out the fry bread. The price was about avg but still not worth the taste. I dont think we will try it again. Sad day.
</review>
<review>I had heard good things about this place in passing and so purchased a Groupon to try it out. So the 5 wine tasting and an appetizer for two.  We arrive aroung 5:30 on a Thursday night and again the place is empty, so you'd think we'd have no trouble getting good service. Wrong!  Three people working and no eye contact. Our server didn't offer any comments on the wines we chose- like what it might pair with, where the grapes were sourced, any charecteristics it had... I'm not a wine snob but I have done many a wine tasting and you usually get some sort of interaction from the person pouring and some information on what your tasting. She did mention how much she liked the goat chesse and cinnamon stuffed dates but that ended our conversation except for one word answers to our questions.  She even left before we were through our tasting and didn't tell us or the next server...ugh.\n\nWe ended up purchasing an additional appetizer, (warm brie served with Triscuts, seriously?) so we planned on spending money...might have even bought a glass of wine after the tasting had the service or atmosphere been inviting. I will not be back for any reason.  If they can't serve 2 people at the bar properly how can they do big wine making parties right?
</review>
<review>I gave this place 2 tries and both times it was a complete FAIL! \n\n1ST time: \n\nI ordered the Gyro and it was awful! The meat tasted like it was just taken out of the freezer and nuked in the microwave. The Pita bread was stale and when I attempted to fold it and take a bite it broke and everything fell out (goody gum drops).  \n\nI understand that a Gyro is not a common dish that every restaurant can prepare with perfection, but don't put it on your menu if you can't make it. It's like an auto repair shop that also does manicures, just don't do it! \n\n2nd time: \n\nI decided to give this place another chance and the end result was I me being out 20 bucks and extremely disappointed yet again. I ordered a simple chicken sandwich and it tasted like cardboard. I was certain that they could not mess up a chicken sandwich and they did. The bread was stale (AGAIN), the chicken breast was small, over fried and nearly tasteless. The fries were nothing to brag about either.

<review>"""This place has screwed things up so many times it's time to write a review.

He proceeds to help two customers in the other lane.  I proceed to sit.  And wait.  And waste almost my ENTIRE lunch hour.  I buzz again.  Ask what the hold up is.  Told we need to print another receipt for you to sign.  Again, this is too challenging and I am eventually asked to send my card back through, so they can void the transaction and run it again.  I agree to do so, but I am really annoyed at this point and let them know they've now wasted my entire lunch hour.  Finally get the reciept, sign it - clip it in and send it through.  Then wait another few minutes and he finally sends the drugs through saying with a shit eating grin \""""thanks for your patience.\""""  \nReally, you're going to thow some sarcastic shade at me after I've just sat there baking in the heat because you can't do your job.  I still probably wouldn't have bothered to write the review but I just had a feeling - and I was right - fuckwit did not void the first transaction, or failed to do it correctly, and I was charged twice for my meds.  Fortunately my credit card company is great and its all being taken care of - but seriously - it is not rocket science.  The drive-thru lane is supposed to expedite the process but I sat out there for close to 30 minutes and pretty much everything was done wrong.

I got a menu from this place in some flier and it's been on my fridge taunting me for the past week or so.  I finally got the pizza craving, and it was conveniently on a Friday when Rosati's offers double coupons, turning a $5 off an order of $20 or more into $10 off.  Definitely not bad, because I think they're a little over-priced and without the coupon/double coupon incentive wouldn't go back.\nAnyway, I wasn't surprised that we weren't the only ones wanting pizza on a Friday and had no problem with the 1 hour delivery time quoted for my pizza and salad.  An hour and a half later, the guy shows up with the pizza and no salad.  He won't just say screw it to the salad and adjust the bill because then we're under the necessary $20 mark for the coupon, but he says he'll be right back and it won't take nearly as long as the pizza did.  We settled into the pizza, which turned out to be cold around the edges and lukewarm in the middle, and really soggy.  Not soggy like the thin crust was buckling under the weight of the toppings (though probably that too), but soggy like the crust was sitting under wet toppings for way too long and it just turned into mush.  Still, it was fairly tasty for cold and soggy and I could see the potential for a decent pizza.  After 45 minutes there's no salad so we call and ask if it could just be canceled.  She says he's already on the way, so no, but offers us coupons.  I'm guessing more coupons that just came with the pizza.  we explain the shiteous experience and she doesn't sound surprised but doesn't offer to right the situation in anyway either.  Finally the guy came with the salad a little over an hour after his first visit and just under 3 hours after we ordered.  We weren't hungry at that point, but I had the salad the next day for lunch, with leftover pizza crisped up in the oven.  Both were decent.\nI emailed Rosati's with what I wrote here because I'm honestly not used to this crappy of service.  If they contact me, I'll try them again and redo this review.  If you're reading this, I guess they haven't yet.\nBottom line:  Probably good pizza, but there's a catch-22 of being overpriced without coupons and overly busy when coupons are offered.  My advice would be to order in or carry out.

<review>Terrible service!!  \nIt took three months to get an appointment with Dr. Bennett.  When the appointment finally arrived, I saw a physicians assistant for about 5 minutes, and then a doctor for about 5 minutes.  I was told to make an appointment for 3 months in the future.  They took blood, urine and had X-rays done of my wrists.  That was two months ago....no diagnosis, no prognosis, no treatment, and the only word from this doctors office was a bill for $230 over and above the $550 insurance already paid them....plus the $30 co-pay.  All for some diagnostic tests (which I never got the results of) and 10 minutes of thier time.\nWhen I called to cancel that next appointment, I was kept on hold for about 13 minutes before I was able to speak to someone.\nI will not be going back to this office EVER.\nIf you really need a rheumatologist, go somewhere else.

<review>"""I would not even normally write a review for a place like this; you get what you expect normally when going to a chain like this.  I went their recently however and pretty much everything was bad.  The food was so heavy and greasy, the service was terrible, and the waitress was really rude.  \n\nOn their menu, they have a \Filet Focaccia Sandwich\"""" which is labeled with an asterisk indicating that it is cooked to order with the standard \""""Undercooked meat could kill you\"""" warning.  I tried to order it medium, and the lady looked at me like I was an idiot, and told me that \""""It comes how it comes, you don't get to choose\"""".  I don't know if the menu is just wrong or what (I ended up opting for a different dish), but her response was ridiculous.\n\nEven if you like outback, I would certainly not recommend this location..."""""""

<review>What kind of sports bar doesn't serve SLIDERS??? Nachos, quesadillas, and celery/carrots options but NO SLIDERS??? Guess that just goes hand-in-hand with the NO MALIBU RUM option!! At least the bartender asked me if their fake option was okay first. Hello... no!!!! \n\nWait service was crap after a spring training game as they did not have nearly enough staff to serve people. Had to wait 15 minutes in a booth before anyone acknowledged us. BUZZ KILL!! \n\nOn the plus side, patio is pretty cool and the pool tables when it's not a busy time!

<review>Busy right after school which is to be expected...Wasn't very clean which is disappointing, especially for an ice cream parlor. We stopped in to try the new soft serve ice cream with sprinkles that turn the ice cream a new color. Don't know if the boy behind the counter was stingy or what, but the kids got only a couple of sprinkles that didn't even cover the ice cream which was disappointing considering they charge for them. All in all wouldn't visit this location again. We prefer the one closer to home :)

<review>"""This will be a 2-part review: 1 for the \free consultation\"""" aspect, and another for the actual experience with staff/ professionals at Bethany Home Healthcare.  I'd give ONE STAR for misleading information on the website  and  verbally by staff.  I'd give THREE STARS for service.\n\""""FREE CONSULTATION\"""": Thanks to another reviewer who mentioned an issue with the \""""free consultation\"""", I made sure to ask this upon the initial phone conversation  and  was assured it was a \""""free consultation\"""".  A receptionist called to confirm the appointment, and again assured me it was \""""free\"""".  I had my husband call  and  he specifically asked if it was free for someone who was insured, \""""due to something he had heard\"""".  The receptionist stated, \""""yes, it is free regardless of an insured or uninsured individual\"""".  Upon arrival, we were asked to fill out detailed paperwork asking for insurance information.  When we questioned this, the receptionist was not rude, but stated that the consultation \""""would be free for us, but Bethany Healthcare would bill our insurance because we're in fact insured\"""".  Since we were insured, they had to bill someone.  If we weren't insured, they would not have anyone to bill.  \n\n\""""ACTUAL SERVICE\"""": We were here to inquire about midwife services for the birth of our 1st child.  We were not greeted when we arrived and the reception staff rarely looked up  and  out into the waiting room.  We arrived 20 minutes early (as requested to fill out paperwork)  and  still waited over 40 minutes after our scheduled appointment time.  We were taken to a small exam room to speak to a technician, and waited another 10-15 minutes for the Certified Nurse Midwife.  The CNM, Donna, was friendly  and  understanding: she explained their role, listened to our concerns/ desires, and answered as many questions as she could regarding our curiosity about giving birth at Phoenix Baptist with a Bethany midwife.  Unfortunately after waiting 1 hour for our initial consultation, Donna had to end our session after 35 minutes due to another appointment.          \n\nI'm confident that the 6 CNM's at BHH would provide quality midwife services, as they seem experienced and reviews show them to be caring  and  understanding of a woman's desires during pregnancy and childbirth.  But based on our experience, we did not choose to use the services of Bethany Home Healthcare.  \nMinor note: there was also a \""""no eating or drinking\"""" sign in the waiting room, which we found odd for a facility that requires pregnant patients to wait for over 1 hour."""""""

<review>"""Yes this place has a decent patio but having a breeze blow little tree leaves in to all your drinks every minute gets old.\n\n I ordered the Howie burger (medium well) with fries.  The fries were floppy and under cooked, the burger was over cooked and the caramelized onions had way way to much balsamic vinegar so they were super sweet.  Which all in all was a waste of $$ and calories. We also ordered deviled eggs as an appetizer which had sweet relish in them which did not work either.\n\nBottom line- This place banks on there lame \waterfront\"""" ( mud canal) atmosphere to serve crappy over priced food.\n\nOOHHHH and when leaving and having my car 75% pulled out of if its spot some valet punk does not wait and whips around me knowing I am leaving.

<review>I can't believe I'm reviewing a McDonald's - but it had to happen.  Not just because I'm a freaking fast food junkie so it was going to happen one of these days anyhow - but because of today's experience.\n\nI've been to this one, well, let's just say more than several times.  The food is always.... uneventful.  It's not one of those specifically great or specifically bad ones.  It's just..... fine?  The only really good thing I got there once was their big breakfast.  It was only McDonald's good, but man it tasted good that day.\n\nAnyhow, so I was grabbing a breakfast burrito (that stupid healthy yogurt was not going to calm the grumbling monster that was my tummy that morning).  For breakfast, I'll normally either get my item solo, or as the meal w/ OJ.  But I remembered seeing last week that in a blind taste test, the McDonald's coffee actually scored higher on a taste test than Starbucks.  So I figured I'd give it a shot.  \n\nACKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!  PLECCCHHHHH!!!  Ick!  Ug!  Gross!  Spit, spit, spit....   I wanted to wipe my tongue down w/ the wood tasting napkin to scrape it all off.  \n\nThey had thrown in some sugar and cream.  I'll normally do a cream and a sugar for one this sized.  I initially tried it black. I thought maybe it was better w/ the stuff added.  This was a SMALL cup, and I added both creamers and all 6 sugars they gave me and I could barely taste any sweetness.  It was like the black hole of coffee condiments.  What is totally sad - I ended up drinking about 1/2-3/4 the cup just trying it after adding each condiment.  I really wanted it to be better.  Kept waiting for that magic ingredient.  It didn't come.  \n\nNasty, nasty, nasty.  Mediocre fast food, fine.  But the extra 15 min drive to Starbucks suddenly looks much more reasonable.

<review>Went for restaurant week last night. Not very impressed. Both my wife and I had the same thing and our friends tried other items. We started with the spinach salad which of the three ordered only one was somewhat satisfied. Small portion and dressing was weak. The other person had lobster bisque that he felt was good.\n\nFor entree, two hanger steak orders that were again small in portions. Mine was almost sent back (now that I think about it I should have) because it was very tough and that after being served sliced. My wife said hers was tender. Other entrees were the drumsticks with mac  and  cheese (satisfying) and the mystery meat dish that was a piece of beef that was buried in mash potatoes, literally. Half order. Tasty but the meat was hard to find. \n\nDessert was the farina with apple dish (different, just OK), tres leche cake (very good) and apple cobbler, again good but small portion.\n\nService was good but very slow, dessert took forever and the getting the check also took too long. When they delivered the coffee we were told that they ran out of spoons. Same with dessert, no spoons. I have to say we were not impressed and not sure we will return anytime soon.
</review>
<review>It's like hooters, kind of.  Or at least I think that's what their going for.  \n\nFood - not bad\nDrinks - standard bar\nAtmosphere - ok for a sports bar downtown, lots of TVs\nService - yeah right.  You'll need to head to the bar at least once if you want to drink anything.\n\nWould I go again?  Yeah, but only if I was meeting someone there and didn't have a chance to persuade them to go elsewhere.  And because it's close to the light rail.

<review>"""Absolutely horrible! If I could give this place half a star, or a negative star even, I would! The service was slow. The sushi was terrible. \n\nThe Mr. and I came here during lunch, we had a total of 4 rolls (2 on their \happy hour lunch menu\"""" and 2 regular specialty rolls). No drinks, only water. We ended up spending more during lunch here than we would have spent at Blu Sushi or Ah-So during dinner. We sat at the sushi bar so I could ask for my signature specialty roll which normaly costs about $9 at Blu and this place charged $13.95! It wasn't anything too extravagant nor hard to make - I could make these at home myself! When we questioned our waitress about our bill she said \""""oh sushi chef wanted $14, but I say no, $13.95!\"""" WOW, a whopping 5 cents, thanks lady, I'll just take that extra 5 cents and buy me something pretty from the Old Navy across the street! Are you kidding me?!\n\nThe price on the bill could have been worth it if the sushi was top-notch, but this sushi was bland, NOT fresh, the pieces were either tiny or falling apart. We had our friend over the other night for home-made sushi and when we compared sushi restaurants she raved about this place....seriously. Oh boy, we felt horrible for her. She obviously had never tried REAL, DELICIOUS sushi before! I'm better off making my own sushi at home then coming to this place! NEVER AGAIN!"""""""

<review>I have tried Richardson's on a number of occasions, none of which were busy.  Mainly I've gone because it serves dinner until midnight, is close and has been recommended by friends.\n\nFirst off, know that the parking chews.  An old school angled strip mall lot that is on much too busy of a corner to approach from the 'wrong' direction.  Second, they never seem to know who is supposed to be seating people.  Is there a host?  Is the bartender staring at you and your guests blankly while taking a phone call supposed to do it?  The second time I snagged a menu and plopped myself down. On none of my three visits have I entered the door and received my drink in less than a 15 minute interval.\n\nOk, now for some positives!  The dark, candlelit decor is quite relaxing.  I also enjoy the copper topped bar and large pillows in the booths to bolster us shorter folk.\n\nMaybe this place is just not for everyone.  There are some tasty dishes I've come across but their sides are tired, especially the GCP which never sounded good to begin with.  No one I've brought with me has been able to spot any values on the menu, including myself so I suppose the large bill at the end isn't doing anything to help my view of this place.

<review>I dig hitting farmers markets once in a while to get some great locally grown produce and other stuff that's good for you but then also other crap which I probably don't really need to eat but I go to these things all starving and end up eating anyway, because I'm a growing boy. \r\n\r\nHowever, I hadn't been to a farmers market in Phoenix until last week, even though I live close to the Town  and  Country Shopping Center (with the Trader Joe's, Bookstar, Chili's, etc.). I only managed to go to this particular farmers market (Wednesdays 10 am -2 pm) because I came home to run a bunch of errands and realized this was going on. \r\n\r\nWhen I drove into the parking lot, I was expecting to see at least a few dozen stalls in the parking lot and a pretty huge crowd, as is the case with farmers markets usually, but all the sellers were stationed on tables in the covered walkway in front of the shops.  There were 10 tables at most, with only one guy selling a handful of produce (the tomatoes here weren't looking so hot). The other tables were selling anything from handicrafts to healing workshops to homemade jars of salsa and jalapeno jelly. Which is totally cool, but I thought the main anchoring businesses of a farmers market were the produce growers, of which there were barely any in sight. And there were only  a small handful of other people milling around. Not a lot of foot traffic.\r\n\r\nAll in all, pretty underwhelming. I'm not knocking the sellers at all who were there (all really nice) or the goods they were selling, but I was expecting way more out of it. Maybe I was there on an off-week, because I barely saw anything that resembled this farmers market in the video on the link.\r\n\r\nI'd say check out this farmers market if you happen to be in the area during midday on Wednesdays, but don't go out of your way to be there. You're not missing a whole lot.

<review>Soooo, I stopped in to Zoe's on a whim this afternoon. My ravished pregnant self was excited to see a grilled cheese with tomato sandwich on the the menu. One that also comes with chip and a side dish (I opted for the fruit salad.) for a reasonable $6.95. The limeade also looked yummy, so I got that, too. While I did have to drive about 20 minutes back to my office, I still believe that this meal would have stunk even if I sat down and ate it on the spot. The bread was burnt, the cheese was American - blech! (even though I see now, I get a choice of cheese instead of all the cheese listed, I wasn't asked.), and the fruit salad was all green apples. Excuse me, one piece of pineapple. The only thing that saves this place from one star is the limeade. And even that could have been less sweet. Skip this place. It isn't healthier for you, it's not local and it under delivered. :(

<review>"""When Trusty Pal Mikey mentioned that this place had won Best Fish in Chips in the Valley at some point in the recent past, it was time to jump into the car and head on downtown for sustenance. \n\nArriving at the restaurant was kind of anti-climatic as on a Monday night during football there didn't seem to be a lot going on (except for a pretty cool DirecTV trailer showing the game which was a nice touch)\n\nThere were several tables of mostly intoxicated patrons, to be expected of a bar/pub during a sporting event but the guy sitting ON the table next to ours stretched out in Cincinnati Bengals gear should probably have been asked to call it a night.\n\nIt took a while to get a server to clean some unidentified stickiness off of our table, bring menus and take a drink order and about then the table next to ours got LOUDER w/the addition of an off-duty server (confirmed by asking our server) wearing a Rose  and  Crown shirt and another woman identified as \the girlfriend of one of the owners.\""""\n\nLoud, rowdy, employees enthusiastically dropping F-bombs didn't make for the best dining atmosphere.  Fail there.\n\nThen the starters arrived...The Sausage roll was mostly cold, the puff pastry which should have been light and flakey was gooey and undercooked although the pickle relish condiment was delicious.\n\nThe Scotch egg was served cold (the server confirmed this was as intended) which seemed odd to me as I've always had them hot (the British version), the flavor was good but the texture of cold sausage just didn't work for me (this is a personal preference not a knock on their version).\n\nThe Fish  and  Chips Main arrived and I must say, the Chips were superb, well cooked and just the right size.  Then things went a bit pear shaped.  The fish, while piping hot was EXTREMELY greasy and devoid of seasoning.  Luckily the homemade tartar sauce was tasty (though the size of the pickles prevented dipping). \n\nI LOVE a good order of Fish and Chips but was sadly underwhelmed by the offering here and was forced to grab something on the way home to satisfy my hunger.\n\n(note:  The table next to us was joined by a patrons Dalmatian and even though we were on the patio, there are just some places that just aren't appropriate for the little furry people.  He was nice enough to lick my leg a few times during dinner though)  \n\nFor future fish  and  chips fixes I will save the 40mile round trip and get it closer to home, very sad that this wasn't as good as i'd hoped it would be."""""""

<review>"""Have been to Nick's many times for breakfast, but not because they have awesome food.  Nick's offered a \buy one get one free\"""" coupon on the back of Fry's grocery store receipts so me and my girlfriend took advantage of that quite a few times until they stopped the promotion.\n\nThe unfortunate thing about Nick's is the pictures of the food in the menu are great, what you get served looks nothing like it.  The food is average at best, me and my girlfriend joked that we wouldn't come back if it weren't for the BOGO deal they were offering.  They stopped offering it about 6 months ago and we haven't been back. \n\nThe restaurant looks nice, it's clean.  The hostess and wait staff are all very friendly.

<review>Arizona Mills has the worst bathrooms I have ever been in. They are always really, really smelly and warm.\n\nI like that there are outlet stores, so you can save a lot of money, but at the same time some of the stores they have are really ghetto and a lot of the outlets have ghetto items.\n\nThe mall is always really packed and there are a ton of kids running around. People walk on the wrong side of the mall, or walk in large groups that prevent people from getting by.\n\nAnd the worst part: there are at least ten different cell phone kiosks and you get badgered every time you walk by. They wont leave you alone. They also have two or three of those carts that sell lotion. I have had people chase me into stores trying to get me to buy natural sea potions. It's just annoying and always makes my shopping experience uncomfortable.

<review>Imagine that on very rare occasions, you treat yourself to a plain glazed donut...not a donut from the grocery store, a real donut - a donut that you get up early on a Saturday to enjoy since they are extra fresh in the morning.  Now imagine that you get home with this treat, only to pull it out of the bag and realize that they have given you blueberry donuts instead.  Now I'm not a donut specialist like the employees at DD are, I'm an average gal with no donut training but I knew immediately upon seeing this donut that it was blueberry.  How did I do this you ask?  The donut was blue and blue = blueberry, blue does not = plain.  Sadly, todays disappointment sums up this DD location.  I'd like a latte please, here's your regular coffee miss.  1 biscuit please, here's your bagel lady.  I'm tolerant when it comes to the occasional mistake but this location always manages to screw up at least one thing with every order.  The food is generally pretty good, you just may not get what you ordered.  Today was the last straw for me, I caught todays coffee mistake but failed to look in the donut bag.  I have no personal vendetta against blueberries but a blueberry donut is like a raisin bagel - wrong.

<review>Rarely will I write a negative review but my experience tonight at Fresh Mint makes it necessary. I have dined here three times prior, all during relatively quiet hours. Tonight, when dining with my family, the restaurant was slammed. I understand that they are a small, family-run joint, but something's gotta give!  My gripe is not with the food but with the service and the owner's poor attitude. During previous visits, he has been able to run the dining room on his own, but tonight he was completely in the weeds. \n\nTo start, they were out of their imperial rolls, which I really enjoy. The owner was apologetic but was also completely harried by his other tables and could barely finish a sentence without being called to another set of patrons. We had a last minute addition to our table when another family member called to say he'd be joining us. We placed orders for appetizers and soup until he was able to make it to the restaurant, but the owner seemed annoyed with our table anyway. \n\nThere was also a large party in the dining room from what seemed to be a radio show that advertises for this restaurant (one of the hosts interrupted our meal to give us a flyer about it) and those patrons were loud and after finishing their meals, hovered other tables to chit-chat. It was quite distracting. \n\nThe restaurant itself is tremendously loud and they play upbeat music from the 50's and 60's. This soundtrack would be fine during a lunch rush but not when people are trying to enjoy a quiet dinner with their families. \n\nAs for the food, it's adequate. A-OK, even. But the prices are outlandish and the service is unpleasant. We will not be returning as there are many fine, veg-friendly establishments in the city deserving of our business.

<review>Good pizza places that deliver are hard to come by, or maybe I've become a Pizza snob, I'll have to check my wallet for a membership card.  Well this was a recommendation from a friend and we were in the mood for pizza, so we ordered up a House Special.  We were told that it would be 45 minutes before we'd have it, pretty standard and generally this is an under-promise over deliver type thing.  This is where we started off on the wrong foot.  I called an hour later to get a status of the pizza, it was out for delivery.  An hour and 10 minutes after placing the order we had it in our hands.  And I have to say, even if they did deliver on time, I don't think I would be ordering from them anytime soon, it just wasn't all that great, everything was pretty bland.  Order here if you need a pizza and any pizza will do and you have the time to wait.
</review>
<review>Pretty blah, really.  \n\nIt's fast food but with sit down prices and barely fast food taste.\n\nThe taco platter Jesse mentioned, is three street tacos on a styrofoam plate which has other little compartments filled with a a few spoonfuls of rice, beans, avocado sauce, and chopped lettuce.  They sprinkle a handful of chips over the top.\n\nThe meat isn't char grilled, but steamed on a flat-top and is greasy/wet enough that the little tortillas break apart before you get halfway through the first one.  I ended up dumping the mix into a pile, tossing the tortillas, and eating it like cereal.  \n\nNot horrible, but also not worth the price.  The combos are $6.75 and drinks are extra ($2). so for $9 you get a pretty weak meal compared with other good/cheap Mexican places or decent sit down joints with service.

<review>So I put on a button up shirt, wear a jacket and am ready for what I am told is a 4 diamond experience.  This is my first time to Tuscany so was looking forward to great service, great food and a relaxing experience.  What we got when we arrived was an Italian bistro that was filled with families wearing shorts and t-shirts, rushed service and decent food.  Apparently, changes have taken place and the restaurant has decided to sacrifice its four diamond status to cater to the family clientele in shorts.  \n\nWhen we arrived the walk down the staircase to the restaurant was promising.  However, once we got to the host stand there was confusion and we were quickly handed off to a server who grabbed two menus, a kids menu (we don't have kids) and began to run away without asking us to follow her.  We got seated and I must say that our server was GREAT under the circumstances that she was given.  Unfortunately, she was rushed and had little support and this made our experience seemed rushed.  (If any of you have seen waiting, I pictured our server as being the waitress who goes outside and yells and screams.)  \n\nWe shared a couple of plates and though we were given extra plates to eat off of, we had to use those same plates for each course as they did not provide a clean plate for the different courses.  Also, our water glasses were not filled even though they said they were going to do so.  \n\nThe food was just good and when you have to drive 20 minutes or so, and you are expecting 4 diamond food and service, good is not good enough.  There are better Italian food restaurants closer to me (Pinos and Gaspers) that I would prefer to go to.  I cannot say any of the food was bad, but I will not go back to Tuscany.  It's too bad that they did change their menu as it sounds like it was great.

<review>Beware being ripped off at Au Petit Four!  If only i can give no star, i would.  We dined late on a Saturday night. We were the only table in the restaurant.  The desserts were good, but very expensive- (1) coffee $2.00, (2) Arrowhead water $2.00, (1) Lorina lemonade $3.50, (1) mango mousse cake, (2) Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9es, (1) chocolate chip cookie, (1) white cake, all total to $48.50.  It was an indication when there were no price tags for the desserts.  The owner didn't even give us an actual bill, but just came by to tell us the total.  We were all pretty tired and didn't give too much thought of the amounts. I am extremely disappointed, SHAME ON YOU AU PETIT FOUR!

<review>A small group of us went here to eat several weeks ago... they weren't so busy that there was a wait, but the table we wanted outside was still dirty. We were tired and starving so we sat down anyway after they promised to have it cleaned straight away.\n\n20 minutes later, nobody had offered to take our drink order, but we managed to get someone to take most of the disgusting plates off of our table. We had asked a few people to send someone out to take our order and the table next to us that had been seated after us had gotten menus and drinks. \n\nThey must've not understood that we were new customers even though the hostess knew, the waiter whos section it was new, and the bus boy and bartender both knew as well because we told them. I guess the filthy plates of half-eaten food and slime were tricking them. \n\nThe five of us sat there trying to talk over the sounds of our gurgling stomachs as we waited for about a half hour without menus, drinks or any indication we were going to get served... finally, an off-duty employee came out and asked us if we had been served. We said no and that we were leaving and he flipped out. He said he wasn't on the clock so he couldn't help us, but he would try to flag someone down immediately.\n\nIn the end, the place smelled very fishy (which you should know is a bad sign when eating at a fish restaurant - especially sushi) and we decided to just split and get food elsewhere. Between the fishy smell and the non service, there wasn't much keeping us there.\n\nThe place looked kinda nice and I'm sure we just had an isolated experience - but until I actually try again and get some food and service, this will have to be my review - one star.

<review>"""I have to agree with the a previous reviewer when he says that he had 'a real mixed experience'...I am giving it 2 stars, but part of me wants to say 1... \n\nWe ordered this as room service, they were having a really good deal on room rates, which included $25 dining credit and waived resort fee...(but enough about that, I'll talk about it in the hotel review later...)... \n\nAnywho, we ordered from the breakfast menu (YAY! Look at us, awake before 11am on a Sunday! hahahaha in your face, Sucka!) \n\nUm...yeah, so the boy ordered the chicken fried chicken breakfast w/ a bagel on the side and I ordered the McCormick Omelet w/ a side of toast (yes...you have to pay extra to get toast with your omelet, bizarre) and 2 small cups of juice...um...$44??? YIKES! Okay, so yes, it's room service, but do you really need to GOUGE people like that? \n\nNevertheless, we paid the piper...(only to find out that the $25 dining credit isn't valid for breakfast the next day...only for the night you check in...would've been nice for someone to SHARE that info...but again, that's reaching back into the hotel review... \n\nHere's the bad...when the $9 chicken fried chicken \breakfast\"""" was revealed, it turned out to be two chicken strips on a couple of biscuits with sausage gravy drizzled on it...and no...I don't mean some sort of fancified McDonald's extra crispy chicken breast select strips, I mean, the kind that you get when you order off of the kids meal at a restaurant. 1/2 a step above a chicken nugget. *sigh* He was heartbroken. I could see it in his eyes. I was also heartbroken, because I had planned to scam a biteful from his plate. *sniffle* \n\nHere's the good...the omelette was very tasty. But the BEST part of it was the Sonoran Breakfast Potatoes. Absolutely delicious, I believe they are hashbrowns with sour cream, jalapenos, and some other seasoning in them, but it definitely is the reason that the review is at 2 stars instead of 1. \n\n(Also, once we got past the whole chicken strip mental barrier, it wasn't bad...but seriously, that was not a $44 breakfast, we didn't even get any alcohol in the juice!)"""""""

<review>They started out okay, but within just a few months they had stopped coming and I never heard from them again! :( Very unprofessional and disappointing. Would not recommend these guys to anyone that is looking for good, consistent landscapers. If you want someone that will come for a while before leaving you in the lurch and do an okay job, these are the guys for you! If you like unpredictability and the adrenaline rush of not knowing if your landscapers will show up as scheduled to spiff up the yard the day before you are having a big pool party, this is the perfect place for you!

<review>The service and ambiance were great for a Chandler restaurant - it's hard to find such a nice spot out here. We sat outside, and the patio had a cozy, romantic feel. We were celebrating a birthday, so the menus had the birthday girl's name printed on them, and we appreciated the nice touch. The server was knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in our decision-making. \n\nThe only problem was the food! We got the mussels, scallops, and hamachi for starters, and the mussels were so fishy to me. I loved the scallops, and the hamachi was just average - not the wow factor I was hoping for with such a pricy dish. Then the entrees came, and I was really disappointed with my pan-seared turbot. The spaghetti squash was drowning in this uber-rich cream sauce, and the fish was greasy and overcooked. My family also complained about their orders - all of them said their food was really (really!) salty, and my dad even had trouble finishing his because his tongue was burning from the salt. He has a high tolerance for salt, so I was really surprised! For the prices we paid, I expected much more delicate, thoughtfully seasoned food.\n\nThen we ordered dessert - banana creme pie, black and white (flourless chocolate cake), and creme brulee to share. The brulee was good, but the pie and cake were nothing to write home about and definitely not worth the price.\n\nOverall, I'm glad I went to Cork to experience the atmosphere and get the special occasion vibe, but I probably wouldn't go back for the food unless the prices go down!

<review>The food gets two stars. The counter (to-go) service gets three stars. The sit down service gets 1.5 stars. I went with friends who have triplets. TRIPLETS. Waitstaff kept asking if we needed the chair at our table with all of their baby gear on it. Granted, it was a Sunday morning. But, for crying out loud people...TRIPLETS. Have some sense. Matzah ball soup was not like my mom's...but nothing ever will be that good. Jewish sliders are a heart attack on challah. Share an order.

<review>Grrr, you could have pulled the right bike that I specifically asked for. I don't think I could have been more specific besides emailing you a picture with pointy arrows to the name of the bike. What did your salesmen do? Pulled the bike close to the color I mentioned. Nothing more disappointing than thinking you are driving very verrrrrry far to get the bike of your dreams. It was like having The Grinch steal Christmas. I won't be back and thats to bad, I'm currently saving my pennies for a cycling bike. Anyone need the address to Bike Barn?

<review>I've been to this restaurant several times for lunch - it's close to the office. The burger is good and Nicoise salad is also a personal favorite. Well it was... In fact I was put off the restaurant as a whole due to a recent experience. The last time I ordered the Nicoise salad with Salmon the potatoes were stale! And by stale I mean noticably shriveled and inside/to taste 100% stale. Given they are a main component of the salad I mentioned it to the waiter when he asked how my meal was. He seemed surprised that I would say anything other than, 'yes it's good thanks' and my response literally caught him off balance... 'I'll mention it to the chef', he said. A few minutes later the waiter returned and thanked me. Erm for what? Telling you the potatoes were stale? There was no offer to replace or sub the  potatoes. In all honesty I didn't really care - I was on a lunch break and it was more important for me to eat within the time I had available... About 5 minutes passed and a lady sitting at the bar ordered the same Nicoise salad. I watched with interest as it was placed in front of her curious as to whether they had subbed the stale potatoes. A few minutes later on a return run to the kitchen I overheard the waiter remark to the chef, 'we've got to dump those potatoes, she's the third person we've had today picking them out and leaving them aside...' So they knew about the issue before I reported it and served me, then after I complained they served them to another customer. My check arrive - there was no mention of the potatoes or any adjustment to the check. I'm done going to Petite Mason - but I'm not done telling this story to everyone I meet!!!

<review>went to try this place based on one review on yelp  the waitress was rough around the edges in her waitress/hostess roll the place smelled like one of those old town restaurants that people probley smoked in for years combined with greese that may not get changed as much as it should. as the waitress cleared tables there was alot of crashing of dishes in the dirty dish bin. I must say i sliped out before ordering food may be good if lucky ........

<review>Tried this restaurant this past Friday for the first time.  Fodor's called it the best restaurant in Phoenix, etc etc.  Someone told me they had a coupon for  two entrees, two salads or soup and a bottle of wine for $44. Sounds fair, right?  We were served two pieces of bread (one for each of us) with oil infused oil.  The one I make at home is better.  Not enough herbs to really flavor it.  We asked for more bread and they didn't seem happy.  Two pieces of bread again.  Never saw that before, counting the heads at the table and then matching the bread pieces. Most restaurant give you a chunk of bread and that's that. The salads were small, fresh but nothing special (what do you want for a coupon???)  The entree choices for the coupon were either pastas or chicken dishes everything is excluded unless you want to pay more.(what do you want with a coupon???) No side dishes come with it. You have pay extra.  (What do you want with a coupon?) I ordered chicken a la berto. Which had fontanelle cheese, spinach, and pancetta.  It was just ok. nothing special.  I didn't bring my magnifying glass to find the pieces of pancetta. (what do you want with a coupon???)  My husband hated his.  I tasted it. Flavorless.  It was chicken something. The word Oggi was in it  and his attraction to the dish was that it had sun dried tomatoes.  I think they took one sun dried tomato, cut it in half and then took that half and cut that half into minuscule pieces and spread it around the plate. As I said before, I didn't have my magnifying glass with me to let him see what mini- sun dried tomatoes look like.. My poor hubby, no sun dried tomatoes for you! (What do you want with a coupon?)  We ordered a side dish, for which we paid extra, of rigatoni with marinara sauce. Rigatoni was cooked al dente perfectly and the sauce was good.  But not better than the one I make at home from scratch from fresh tomatoes.  Don't you guys expect restaurant food to be better than your own?  I do. And finally, the bottle of wine. Not the best and a little vinegary.  (what do you want with a coupon?) \nI guess everyone knows the conclusion to this review.  If Fodor's called La Fontanella the best restaurant in Phoenix, then Phoenix is a very small town with very few italian restaurants.  I, for one, will not be going back with or without a coupon.\n\nBy the way, I have eaten at Bel Fiore's, an unpretentious, no white table clothed restaurant on Cave Creek and the food is one thousand times better.  And I don't need a coupon to eat there.

<review>We were looking to join a gym recently, but when we showed up to talk to someone and get a tour, they wanted us to fill out these liability release forms and sign them. Why do we have to divulge all of our personal information including our date of birth and sign a liability release form just to get a tour? We walked out. That seemed like a red flag. A sneaky way to get us on some kind of spam mailing list or something. No Thanks! We went straight to LA Fitness and they were happy to give us a tour right when we walked in.

<review>I don't get it!  We went there tonite and having read so many reviews, we were excited and then we were disappointed.  Nothing  I would say was outstanding.  We started with a special that was calamari fritters and the Calamari should have been chopped because they were incredibly tough.  We then had another small plate with eggplant, bacon and can't remember what else...OK... but not something we would rave about.  Then we moved on to the warm duck salad.  It was bland, with the exception of the duck.  The duck breast did have a nice flavor, but that didn't compensate for the lack of flavor of the grilled lettuce leaves.  It had interesting ingredients, but didn't feel they melded together.  The white fish with the variety of mushrooms was the best thing we had.  The mushrooms were outstanding.  We did have the clams with bok choy or cabbage and bacon.  I thought it was good, but my husband ate just one clam and it was not as fresh as we anticipated, so I had the remaining  clams and thought they were o.k.  All in all, we have eaten at other Japanese restaurants,  and for us, this was not a stand out and the likelihood  that we would return for  a second chance seem improbable.  Sorry! \n By the way, the servers were very good at explaining everything and brought our dishes out timely, not rushing us, but not taking forever, either.   Service I would give a 5 star, but we would have expected 5 star in the food category!

The salad was \Ok\"""", but the King Crab was horrible, and the Lobster Tail was over cooked. Very disapointed in the food quality.

<review>"""My DH  and  I  went for our anniversary last night, 03/27/10. The staff were friendly when we arrived and told us \Happy Anniversary\"""", we received a card, as well. We went with their winter 3 course menu for $35. I got the lettuce wraps, tiger shrimp, and chocolate souffle. My husband got the rock shrimp tempura, salmon, and guava tart. Both of our appetizers were ok, nothing special. The entrees were about the same, nothing special, the shrimp were overcooked, and the salmon had too much sauce on it, you couldn't taste the salmon, the ingredients were good, but the way they prepared both entrees, were not very good. The highlight of the evening were the desserts, they were both good! \n\nWe've been to Roy's before, and we enjoyed our experience, so this was a complete disappointment.  Last year we went to Noca, and the food and experience was much better."""""""

<review>Phoenix has a dearth of good music venues.  When Crescent Ballroom opened up, I heard great things.  I finally had the opportunity to see a show there.\n\nMy first impression was great.  There is seating in the back if you need to rest, the place is intimate, the acoustics seemed good... In fact, it was great until people started showing up.\n\nThe problem with Crescent is the scene.  If you want to hang out and chat (loudly) with a bunch of hipsters, it's probably the place for you.  If, however, you are there to actually listen to a live band, good luck hearing the slow songs over all the chatter.\n\nThe parking situation is also pretty annoying.  You really do need exact change, and there's no other obvious place to park nearby with an actual parking attendant.\n\nIn all fairness, it's really a decent little venue.  The live music is just unfortunately secondary to the social scene.
</review>
<review>"""Okay, I wasn't too crazy about this place.  I read some reviews on here saying that it was a great place to take out-of-town guests so I went ahead and took a visitor there a few days ago.  The day we went up there happened to be very chilly, with quite the bracing wind.  So when we first sat down to lunch at the \Mammoth Steakhouse,\"""" we were expecting a nice, heated area to enjoy our good eats.  Well, there was to be no heat whatsoever.  All they had to keep the place warm was human body heat and tiny, tiny space heaters.  It also seemed like the place was understaffed, with one waiter to serve a large room of customers.  I ordered the Mammoth burger, which was tasty, but unfortunately it and the fries got cold a little too prematurely, on account of the FRIGID environs.\n\nWe then made our way over to a few shops here and there.  I was impressed with one or two, but the rest was very overdone and kitschy (I think that's how that's spelled).  One store had a bunch of clay magnets, pottery, and figurines you could buy from a lady who was making them only for fun and not money (all the money you gave her went to the \""""town\"""").  After we bought a few magnets, we got crazy at a store called \""""Cactus Flats.\""""  Now, if you're into cultivating plants, but are shitty at watering them enough, this is the place for you!  The lady there sells both cacti and succulents.  The succulents can be \""""sprinkled\"""" once a week and the cacti need only a tbsp of water a month!  And the plants sold there are really gorgeous.  Never did I realize how many species of cacti and succulents there were!  I went a little crazy and bought six plants.  However, most of them are affordable at only $4 each.  \n\nThen, we decided to buy a \""""train\"""" ticket.  \""""Train\"""" tickets cost 12 bucks for an adult and this thing only goes around the town once while some tour-guide (who probably despises his job) tells you random facts about the town, mining, and the lives of the surrounding Saguaro cacti.  Big freakin' whoop.  Twelve bucks down the drain.  \n\nNext was the \""""mine\"""" tour.  This consisted of an over-dramatized elevator ride down a \""""shaft\"""" and a walk-through of a FAKE mine.  You know it's fake as soon as you see that the rocks in there are made of PLASTIC.  There I was thinking I was going to take a trip down a real-live, historic mine.  It could have been redeemed if the tour guide was a decent-enough speaker.  If I didn't know any better, I would have been convinced our poor tour guide was drunk.  His pauses were long and way overdone and you could tell that he, too, probably despised his job.  I could have sworn I sensed a drunken slur here and there, but he didn't smell like alcohol, so I trusted he was okay.  Either way, he was a shitty orator.  \n\nOnce we got outta there, we went to a \""""Cantina\"""" in order to get a good hot chocolate.  That was also a bust.  I was expecting a good, genuine mug of hot chocolate.  Nope.  Alls we got for 3 bucks each were tiny styrofoam cups and shitty machine-generated hot chocolate (the kind that comes out right next to the French Vanilla cappucino flavor).  \n\nMy friend was a doll and said she loved it, but I knew that place could have been way better.  They advertise it as a ghost town, but all it is is just a bunch of reconstructed buildings put up to resemble the previous town that was located there.  The only redeeming things were: the beautiful backdrop of the Superstition mtns, the Cactus Flats, and the kind-hearted pottery lady."""""""

<review>I adore, love, crave,  and  dream about good Greek food. \nThat being said, I just don't enjoy My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. (And I really hate when people just call it My Big Fat..how appetizing is that??)\n\nMy biggest problem is with the pita. I mean, really, you're a Greek restaurant, you should at the VERY least have good pitas. They taste straight out of the store-bought bag. After that, there really is no redemption.\n\nThe menu is very chain standard, and is good for families with kids and big groups. It's definitely good for people with big appetites because their portion sizes are out of control.\n\nThere are better restaurants in the area for sure, even better restaurants right there in the AZ Center.

<review>I would love to give a sterling 5-star review for Carly's - I love the atmosphere, the dcor (hand-drawn cartoons on the tables were awesome), the artsy vibe and the location - but I just can't. \n\nThe first time I came, it was off an extended happy hour at the Roosevelt - which is conveniently within walking distance. A friend ordered the hummus and flatbread, which to my starved being were the most delicious I had ever tasted. I also drunkenly ordered an organic-vodka martini - the last thing I needed was a martini! - that tasted, as I recall, OK.\n\n it was after another happy hour visit to the Roosevelt that I returned to Carly's with visions of that luscious hummus and Plaid-like vibe dancing in my head, and making my mouth drool. Of a much more sober disposition, I actually studied the menu and was severely shocked. \n\nFirst, the prices. $7+ for a Stella? What the hell? And that dubious organic martini - it wasn't on the menu...did I imagine that? - Well, any martini was $10-12 ?! Is this Durant's? It definitely wasn't THAT good of a martini. \n\nI quickly found my hummus/pita app. and ordered a large portion, growing decidedly more disappointed/heartbroken with the entre options. Nothing, and I mean nothing, sounded even remotely appetizing. It was all very rich yet bland-sounding. Does that make sense? Like brie and turkey on Panini bread... Eh, ok. I was hoping it would be like Roosevelt, where you order the grilled cheese and tomato soup with reservation, and then are blown away. Sad to report - not so.\n\nHowever, I was a huge fan of the veggie chips that came with our hummus and flatbread (which, thank god, was as delicious as I kind-of-remembered). No problems with the service, but from the rest of the reviews, it sounds EXACTLY like Plaid, except downtown...and with a way less-tasty menu.\n\nSo, $50 later, we'd had a mediocre couple of entrees, an appetizer, no buzz and some leftovers that are still sitting in my fridge a week later. Do'h! \n\nthat really sucks, because I think they have the foundation for a restaurant I would adore and go out of my way to go to and want to support - extensive beer selection, great ambiance, perfect location, local ownership - Please Carly's, can I petition for some better quality/more adventurous food options? I'll even then pay for the overpriced beer without complaint.\n\n*Editor's Note : Seriously, does anyone else think the beer purchased at Tops is always about 7 degrees too warm? It's cool enough to drink, but warm enough to not be refreshing, and it drives me crazy. \n\nAnd, hang on, I'm not done: What the hell makes a martini organic anyway? Non-pesticide-infused, no-hormones-added-potatoes for the vodka?   ...Highly dubious, indeed.

<review>I am surprized to see the great reviews for this establishment.  I have never seen the price for a simple pizza add up so fast. I went inside to order a pie to go ( with Jalepenos). I watched as the cook sniffed the container of Jalepenos , made a face and then dissapeared in the back with the container . I am not sure to this day what that was all about but it certainly put me off pizza for a while.

<review>"""5/12/10\n\nCame in to try some happy hour eats (Fibber Magee's offers 50% off all apps and flatbreads between 4p and 7p).  To begin my dining experience, I found the darkness in the pub to be overwhelming (a word I'd rather use in this context is \oppressing,\"""" but I'm trying to lighten up!).  I wouldn't have minded so much (as I could've sat closer to the door left ajar, which allowed light to come in), but then the music blaring out of the speakers overhead was just too much!  To compound the situation, the song selections were either U2 (which I liked) or jarring Irish punk rock (which I don't), most of which were of the latter.  :(  Perhaps I should've walked away after making these observations, but I've had FM bookmarked for at least six years now, and I wanted to get it over with.\n\nAfter many inquiries about food preparation, the bread used (which company?  specific ingredients used?), etc., I decided I'd go w/ the crabcakes and the braised rib sliders.  The crabcakes (topped w/ roasted red peppers and garnished w/ wasabi and mustard mayo, the latter I opted out) also came w/ a side mixed greens salad and a citrus vinaigrette. While this dish wasn't the best-looking of all the dishes I had that afternoon- don't let the pic of the bread pudding fool you, it was the best-tasting, but this isn't saying much.  I didn't care for the watered-down flavor of the citrus vinaigrette, and frankly, the crabcakes had enough flavor, so the lack of dressing wasn't a big deal.  I don't know if I'd order them again, though...  What was a big let-down was the braised shortrib sliders' dish.  Now these sliders looked fantastic, but the shortrib pieces were so sinewy and/or fatty, that, as much as I tried, I couldn't chew through any!  I really wanted to like these, bec. of those gorgeous-looking fried onion strings that sat on top of each slider.  Thankfully, my server offered to swap them for something else, and it was w/ a little sadness that I said goodbye to those onion strings :'(\n\nLately, mussels haven't appealed to me, so my server's suggestion to try FM's wasn't giving me much hope.   Surprisingly, these mussels tasted OK, and the price is right (for happy hour), and if I weren't already not disappointed in the darkness of the pub; the loudness of the music's volume; and the sub-par quality of the shortribs, I may have enjoyed them more.  With the hope of finding something good to write about, I ordered the bread pudding.  (At this point, I should've just given up.)\n\nThe bread pudding dish, which you'd think, looking at the pics I took, would taste good,  was a disaster!  It was dark in the pub, yes, but the dish looked like they just placed slices of bread down, showered them w/ dried cranberries, and poured some white chocolate sauce.  Something was amiss- was it even baked?  How was it prepared?  There wasn't enough cream sauce to cover most of the bread.  I was told that the bread was indeed soaked in the cream, and then baked, but this bread pudding had to be the worst I've ever tried.  The pics looked great, but don't be fooled...  \n\nThe server was friendly, and most of the stars reflect her attempts to appease me, but I didn't enjoy my experience there, and would never recommend this place to anyone."""""""

<review>There were several things wrong with my recent visit to this restaurant.  I showed up wearing all black and was seated by a manager.  They use white linen and having worked in restaurants forever, I knew my napkin was going to leave white lint all over me.  I also knew that the manager knew, or should have.  I had to ask two people for a black napkin before one was delivered.  I ordered an Iced tea and the server brought me a mango Iced tea.  I asked her when she came back if they only had flavored tea and she said they did.  Why would you not tell me this when I ordered it you crazy beoch? Is what went through my head but I was celebrating my mother's birthday and didn't feel that would've been appropriate.  We ordered oysters and I ate two of them.  The first tasted like the ocean, not the nice clean blue waters of Hawaii type ocean, but the barnacle covered madness that smells like nasty ocean, you know what I mean.  The second one tasted better but I couldn't get the image of barnacles out of my head after that first one and I ate no more.  I then had the wedge salad which was fantastic and finished with Blacked Chicken Linguine in a cajun cream sauce.  It was also quite tasty.  Aside from the oysters the food was good, unfortunately the service calls for a two star rating.  Maybe this place is better during dinner.

<review>Having eaten at some amazing restaurants in the valley and around the world we were excited to try the 7 course tasting menu at posh... However, everything from\n Service to food to drinks to pricing was a huge disappointment. Spending over $100 pp without drinks we expected to be wowed. Sadly we left hungry and irritated. Of all the nicer restaurants we dined In around Phoenix I.e. Mastros, sassi, roka, nobuo, ocean prime, etc.. This was by far the worst. Each Of the 7 portions came as a tiny bite leaving us underwhelmed and hungry. Food took Forever to come as did drinks. The servers were many but irritable and not very effective.. Overall of the 7 courses  not One left us satiated and pleasantly surprised. After a $300 meal we went out to eat and I was so annoyed I wanted to call the  owner and complain. Overrated, overpriced and completely Not worth it!!! Ps we do appreciate smaller, mOre meaningful entrees but a single scallop and a small forfull of fish should be considered a course when there is no main course.. The shrimp course consisted of 2 tiny shrimp In some pur\u00e9e and he server had no clue where they came from Or if they were wild or farm raised. Embarrassing !!

<review>"""I was mildly okay with Julios because it was cheap and it never made extravagant claims to being very good.  It's greasy, overly-cheesed \Mexican\"""" food that's bad for you.  Sometimes that's what you want... the large, lousy portions for not much money with shredded bits of iceberg lettuce.  Make no mistake, it's not good, but sometimes we all have our guilty pleasures and sub-adequate Mexican food happens to be one of mine sometimes--usually when I'm hungover or something.\n\nLast time I went there, I popped open a little salsa container for the chips and, Jesus Christ, it was a solidified gelatinous cube.  It wasn't frozen, either.  It was gelatin.  It was this... ugh.  It was denser than Jell-O, too, you could slice it with a plastic knife and it would continue standing on its own.\n\nAnd that's when I realized that what I was eating wasn't just bad food that's fun to treat yourself too every couple of months or a few times a year, I was eating a pile of failure.  The novelty was gone.  It's all fun and games until you see that salsa.  It's like having fun drinking in a dirty dive bar, then you fall down on a pile of broken glass.

<review>Total... service... breakdown!  I waited the obligatory 30 minutes on a Friday night so that my 2 boys and I could duck in for dinner (the make-your-own pizza is a kids favorite). When our buzzer buzzed, I took it up and the gentleman at the front said it must have malfunctioned.  My BS meter went to 10 as we waited for another 10 minutes for a seat.  Once seated, the waitress took a ton of time to get our order, and then for some inexplicable reason didn't enter our order until the first kids meal came out to the table - spanning at least 45 minutes from sitting to serving.  Maybe it was a bad night, I could hear constant service and kitchen screw-ups from the party of 10 behind us.  Food quality was bad on top of this... burger bun was hard, pizza dough was crusty *before* they cooked it as my son was making his pizza... the only thing they didn't screw up was my beer.    \n\nAlthough the wait is comporable, I will pick Yard House at the other end of Desert Ridge next time.  I'll stick to Rock Bottom on the West side at Arrowhead, which has never let me down.

<review>I've bought tires from Discount Tire for years at different locations and have had a good experience, but this location was different. I went in to get some new tires with my fianc\u00e9. John the sales guy pushed a certain brand, specifically because they were running a rebate special. Tires are tires, especially on a Prius, so we went with them. \n\nLater that day, when filling out the rebate form online, I noticed that the model number that we purchased was not listed on the valid model numbers for the promotion. I called back to Discount Tire, told them the dilemma, who then stated the model number was irrelevant and the rebate would go through. \n\nI'll give you 1 second to contemplate where I'm heading with this. A couple weeks later we got an email saying our entry was denied due to non-valid model number. We called back to Discount Tire, where John denied any knowledge, spoke to the manager, who told me it was his last day and his hands were tied. I then called the regional office, left a message and NEVER got a call back. \n\nNext time I need tires, I'm going to C and R or Big O, or any other of the countless places on every street corner that sells them. Just not a way to run a business.

<review>"""I found out about this place via a Groupon offer. Walked into the relatively small dining area with my wife and the food appeared to look good.  Unfortunately after standing around in the dining area for several minutes being ignored by the four workers on duty, with not even a quick \Hi, we'll be with you in a few minutes\"""", we did an about face and left.  We walked over to an adjacent restaurant Pho Avina and had great service and very good Vietnamese food.\n\nSo my summary is that the food might be fine, but the service probably would be an issue.  Sometimes customer service is king and hopefully this restaurant will learn this."""""""

<review>"""OK I know I am going to get flack for this but here goes. Are you freaking kidding me, no tarter?!? \n\nOn the advise of Abu whose taste buds have now come into question, I tried Pete's yesterday. I trekked out in what felt like 500 degree heat to the ATM. Because Pete has not stepped into the 21st century yet! \n\nThe whole time I am thinking if they are still in business after no tarter and no debit it must be good, right? Wrong. I have been tricked, hoodwinked, bamboozled, led a stray, run a muck. Just flat out deceived! \n\nI ordered the deluxe seafood combo 2 pieces of fish, 7 shrimp, fries and a 32 oz drink. Which by the way did not have its price listed. I figured it couldn't be to much the regular combo has 1 less piece of fish and 3 less shrimp was only 5.95. Wrong again $9.45! Again thinking this fish must be outstanding! \n\nI get it home and it was still piping hot and smelled wonderful! Again with the trickery. I started with a french fry and it wasn't completely done in the middle yuck! I then moved onto what Pete describes as shrimp, really there was shrimp in there? I never tasted it and only saw some small specks of white and red inside the gross grease laden dough! UGH I had to spit it out. Even my dog left it and she has been known to eat her own poop! \n\nThe only reason Pete's did not rate a 1 star from me is the square fish. Yes I said square, it is a square patty just like McDonald's only it does taste better than Mickey D's. I didn't care for the red sauce on my fish. The 1st piece I ate plain and the second piece I added my own tarter sauce and it was delicious. On a sidebar some of the other fries were edible and pretty tasty. \n\nI have yet to find a joint that can top the catfish at Honey Bears but not for lack of trying. \n\nMoral of this story, only get the fish and chips, make sure your chips are cooked and have tarter on the ready!\n\nAlso Lain gave me this tid bit of info... \Pete the owner was murdered as he slept, they used a hammer and bashed his head in, just some trivia for you...\""""\n\nYeah they bashed his head in over that shrimp and no tarter sauce!"""""""

<review>I booked a rental through Costco Travel.....\n\nthe line was extremely long( like waiting for a ride at Six Flags).\n\nIf you prefer to use a debit card, they will slap $200 dollars more on hold in your account and run a credit check. I think that it's the most ridiculous thing ever. \n\nI hate the fact that I didn't get to choose my car at their garage. A slip was given to me on where my rental is parked, and I had to get to it on my own; without any personal interaction if i had any questions about the vehicle. I didn't like the Ford Fiesta they rented out to me. The breaks were making some sounds....AND!!! it was cherry red. I didn't like a cherry red car.\n\nOther companies gave you options and are more personal. Some even pull the car up for you, and help you put your luggage in the trunk.\n\nI like to be treated like a princess.\n\nTheir insurance is also pretty expensive. I was shell shocked and for the very first time, i drove a rental without any form of insurance. Thank goodness, the car was alright. My damage: $152 for a 6day rental. Not bad.

<review>I have been wanting to try this place out for a long time and have heard great reviews.  At 130p on a Friday there was a 20 minute wait.  BUT...there was a table in the bar so we opted for that instead.  We sat down and ordered and were very excited about the atmosphere.  We ordered the ravioli for an appetizer, OMG delicious!  Superb!  Amazing!!!  We then moved on to the Italian wedding soup- Yikes- something went wrong.  The orzo looked like rice and was in clumps on the bottom of the bowl.  It was so salty I could not even eat it.  I had to return it.  There didn't seem to be a problem with that and our waitress did take it off the bill.  Oh by the way, I had to ask 3 times for more butter for the lovely flat bread and sourdough they place on the table.  Also, my friend had to ask twice for hot water for her tea.  The service was slow, forgetful, and not so friendly.  So, let's get back to the food.   I had ordered a flatbread which was basically a totinos pizza. yuck!  I had 2 corners and my friend took it home with her to take to work for lunch.  I would rather spend 99 cents for a cheap frozen pizza than eat at this place again.  Maybe a little happy hour with the ravioli- but nothing more...

<review>"""A veteran of conveyer belt sushi restaurants, I was excited one had opened up here in Phoenix. However, I have to agree with the comment that they are \as fine as McDonald's\"""" because the sushi I had there wasn't very tasty. \n\nHowever, their greatest faux pas is not mediocre sushi; it's location. If they were up by ASU, there's no question they would be busier. But they are way out in a strip mall in SW Tempe, and I was one of only two customers at the dinner hour. I hope they get more of a lunch crowd.\n\nIf I were them, I'd 1) change location. They're open til 11pm, so they should be around a college or more populated area. 2) put sensor strips on the bottom of the plates so they can tell how many times the sushi has gone around. The same plates kept going by the whole time I was there, and who knows how long they had been on the belt. 3) The unagi I had was pretty good, but the tamago was tasteless. Figure out which items are tasty and which could be improved. Then improve them."""""""

<review>"""Won't be going back.  I am always looking for a good Mexican place-- on a specific search for the best guac in greater Phoenix--, and one of my coworkers thought we should give it a try.  The one good thing is the decor inside- it really is nice.\n\nNow on to the \no bueno\"""" portion of our program... In summary, the food was bland, the food was cold, the service wasn't that great, and the salsa and the guacamole were just plain WEIRD.  No need to overexplain bland and boring food (I had a chicken burrito, and I added cheese, rice, and sour cream), but I do want to point out that I ate GRISTLE in my chicken... which is what finally made me stop trying.  Other items to note:\n\n1.  The server would barely glance at us, and when she came to ask for our order, she hadn't even asked for a drink order first.  Also, we had to ask twice for more tortilla chips.  I will say, though, that our main dishes came out fast... but mine was ice cold.\n\n2.  The flavor of the salsa was okay, but the texture was-- as another Yelper has described-- exactly like ketchup.  Bizarre.\n\n3.  The guac.  Oh the guac.  Horrific.  The first question was the pale green color.  My friend and I spent at least 4 full minutes trying to figure out what one would mix with avocados to get that exact Lawrence Welk-era seafoam color.  There was no onion, no peppers, no lime, NO flavor.  After a few additional samplings (more out of morbid curiosity than anything), I came up with EGG.  Yes, like hard-boiled egg whites.  Color and texture.  Bweck.\n\nTo my food-loving compatriots out there:  don't do it.  Not worth your time or money."""""""

<review>Meal was comped went because it was - close to Westin Kierland. Ate at this place and sat outside due to having to wait 45 mins to sit inside. It was about 80 degrees outside and they have mist falling from the ceiling to keep you cool.\n\nFor an Italian place, it's alright. There's much better food. I had the steak skirts and came with a salad. I would not recommend this and should have gone for the pasta.\n\nAll in all it's pretty not good for the price, but it was free so, whatever.

<review>Do not go to this Pier 1 and try to open a credit card.  We went there the week of Christmas to get a new dining set, and though we had the money to buy it outright, we decided to take advantage of their interest free credit card option since it was so close to Christmas and that could help us with gift time. January rolls around, and we discover that they completely lied to us, and the account was not interest free for 12 months at all, despite the fact that you can STILL go on their website and that is that advertised deal.  No manager at the credit company would even believe us, and we've spent the last 5 months having them screw us over again and again charging these piddly late fees for what reason I have no clue, considering we paid it off in full once we found out they were a bunch of liars.  It seems no matter how often I pay off the 15 dollars or less, they come up with some reason why there is always another charge on there.  Just unbelievable.  I will not be shopping at ANY thieving Pier One anymore.

<review>Stopped in here for a Friday happy hour with co-workers. The beer was decently priced for happy hour. The appetizers were decently priced, which would be awesome if they were good.\n\nThe chicken strips were terrible. I have never eaten something so greasy and yet dry all at once. They are beer battered (like fish) which could be good, but the execution on this was terrible. The outside was really greasy which took away all of the crispy goodness that usually happens when things are battered and deep fried. The chicken itself was dry as a bone. We also got an order of fries that came out cold and were just below mediocre.\n\nThe place was really warm, which could be attributed to the summer heat, but we were sitting inside, so there is a fair assumption that air conditioning would be involved.\n\nI'll pass next time my coworkers are planning a trip here. I'd be better off eating at McDonald's.

<review>Awful. Simply awful. \n\nBeing a vegetarian (who DOES NOT eat eggs) my options were about as varied as fruit and oatmeal. So exciting *rolls eyes*\n\nWe had a reservation at Noon on Fathers Day for a party of 9. Everyone ordered almost immediately after scouring the menu online and coming prepared. Our food arrived within minutes of 1 pm. An hour... seriously?\n\nMy fruit has what look liked bits of paper towels in it. Might not of been, who knows. My toast was cold and barely toasted, at best.\n\nI live in Phoenix and my family lives close to this location. Hence, why we went there. I am used to restaurants offering atleast a few dish options. Not this one--not even a veggie burger.
</review>
<review>Terrible. \n\nThis spot was going to be the kind of spot I could get quick dinner on a hectic weeknight with my Family. Not So! The Calamari was extremely tough and did not taste fresh. The pizza was just bad. It did not have layers of texture or taste in any way. Just black bottomed and crisp. Not burnt, but a strong sour burnt taste. The center was underdone and very soggy. Just a bad meal. This was my first time eating in, second time actually eating the Pizza. Both pizza's were a TERRIBLE let down.

<review>"""I was very excited to see what the new La Fonda location was like and what the food quality and the menu was going to be like, after the La fonda move from the Scottsdale location.  I used to go to the old location for many, many years, and loved it.   The new Baseline building location has been completely remodled and redecorated inside and out.  It looks great.  Right away, however,  I noticed a menu problem.  I used to order a burrito, alacarte and a taco or two.  The new menu has only burrito combination plates.  You cannot order a burrito ala carte.  A green chili burro will cost you $8.95, and come with beans and rice.  No other option is available.  I was told by our waiter that \They are trying to get away from the ala carte thing.\""""  I was very disappointed.  When my \""""Build Your Own Combo\"""" Lunch Menu order (burros are not offered with this option) came out, I was disappointed.  The shreadded beef taco meat was dry, tough and flavorless.  I could not even bite through it.  A server did offer to replace it with something else, but, I was starting to just want to get out of there, and count my losses.  The ground beef taco had no flavor, and the cheese portion put on both tacos was skimpy, at best.  The cheese enchilada was thin and skimpy.  The plate was very hot, and the beans and rice were OK.  It just is not the La Fonda I used to crave, and I doubt I will be back.  I might give it another chance, down the road a bit, to see if they improve.  This might be another case of a place that used to be good when they were small, but lose it when they expand to a huge new building."""""""

<review>"""They say to never judge a book by it's cover and never judge a restaurant by their sign outside it's doors, but in this case, you pretty much can since the \Heart Attack Grill\"""" sign did not really stand out, therefore making it quite plain like it's calorific burgers. From the moment I stepped into this burger joint, I just couldn't feel the good vibe in the air. Three friends and I went here on our way to our grand road trip from Chicago to Los Angeles to Las Vegas and back. The consequences of not coming here were that (1) we could have eaten some steak at Big Texan Ranch at Amarillo, TX and/or (2) we could have visited the Grand Canyon. Let's just say at the end, we would have rather done the other options instead. Although we still saw the giant chasm on our way home, we still missed out on some potentially good steak in Amarillo. So as soon as we walked in the HAG, I just had this weird feeling like when you're watching a scary movie and someone is about to die. But in this case, I walked in and had this feeling that these burgers aren't going to be that great.\n\nOne thought came to mind when I first heard of this restaurant: \""""Hooters with Unhealthy Burgers?\"""" I decided to come here because this place was #39 on the Travel Channel's \""""Chow Down Countdown\"""" list; also because the waitresses are dressed as naughty nurses. From the segment, the place looked like a party. It was quite the opposite when my friends and I went. It seemed dead, although to HAG's defense, we came there on a Tuesday at 6:30, 2 hours before the restaurant closes. There were only two young nurses working as well as the head (older) nurse. The two young nurses were attractive but one of them was quite snobby. \n\nOK now to the burger. It was cooked real well and full of calories, lard, fat, and did I mention calories? I must say it was an \""""okay\"""" burger but not in the \""""Got to have again!\"""" category. With the unlimited fries that swam in lard, it's the same concept. I wasn't a big fan of getting my own condiments in the condiments bar. The same \""""CNN Heart Attack Grill portion\"""" clips was being played over and over on a loop throughout their big screens, rather than them showing sports. The aroma of a real hospital and the smell of lard also didn't help the cause. \n\nI had the Triple Bypass Burger and I was only able to eat it halfway. Overall, I can try to justify my 2-star rating because in my opinion, these burgers were not that great to me. My three other friends would definitely agree with me. Let me explain: Keep in mind that we were driving from Chicago to pass by Chandler non-stop. I don't know about my friends but I came through HAG's doors after being in a car for over 24 hours on a lightly filled stomach. Maybe it was the lard fries or the sugar Coke filling me up a little, but I didn't get the satisfaction from eating half of my burger. I actually got a better satisfaction from eating a Big Mac throughout the years. When it comes down to it, you eat here once and you'll probably not come back again, unless (1) you weigh over 350 lbs. and can eat for free, (2) You have paid the $500 annual membership fee to have 3 daily paid meals, or (3) you just want to check out the \""""nurses.\"""" \n\nI think my friends still have not forgiven me for taking them here. But to me, it's one of those, \""""Place wasn't so great, but I'm glad I still came here for I would have never known how it is.\"""" The Heart Attack Grill just didn't fill me up in the right way."""""""

<review>I was fortunate to be in town during Memorial Weekend so I could check out the Farmer's Market and the $5 breakfast. FYI, the Market is closed for the summer and will re-open in October. We got there a little after 9am, but there was only a handful of vendors.  That was disappointing, but maybe we got there too early.  Since I didn't want any jewelry or honey, I went to stand in line for breakfast.  You actually pay first at the cashier line, then take your receipt to the breakfast station, so if it's crowded, you'll be standing in 2 lines.  A little annoying, but the breakfast station line moves fast.  I had the veggie frittata w/goat cheese, which came with Texas toast and potatoes.  It was ok, nothing special.  Other choices included pancakes and steak.  Not too much to do in the morning.  No mechanical bull, no activities.  The sundown hay ride and cookout might be more fun, but I was pretty disappointed. Probably won't go back.

<review>"""Warning on Sprint:\n\nEven if you pay the monthly handset insurance, they have engineered their policies to basically force you to purchase an upgrade and re-up your contract if you run into ANY hardware problem after the first year or so of ownership.\n\nThe insurance only covers a direct replacement. If your handset is even slightly out of date they will tell you to wait (phoneless) 3-5 days for the replacement to get to you.\n\nOf course, you can always upgrade . . . for a fee.  . . \n\nBut if you have made the mistake in good conscience of taking the phone to a service center first and waiting an hour to see if your phone can be fixed, and then decide to upgrade while there, that's an $18 fee for trying to get it fixed in person rather than just putting in your ticket online and waiting 3-5 days. \n\nWhen you call to complain, you will be told that the charges are \system generated\"""" and thus can't be removed. I found that escalating to a manager (using keywords \""""cancel my account\"""") and telling him/her that you have a system that will generate letters to the attorney general and your credit card company and there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT tends to work. I got my $18 back and I strongly suggest everyone else do this as well. If you don't get what you want on the first call, call back. And again. And again.\n\nThese policies apply no matter which plan you are on, and no matter how long you have been with them, and no matter how much other business you represent as a corporate customer.\n\nSo why 2 stars? Because really all cell phone companies basically suck balls and have from day one. At least Sprint usually lets me connect."""""""

I came onto yelp, read the reviews, looked up the location in the map. When we headed to the tea room, we ran into a problem. A big problem. Aliens had abducted the business!! Just kidding, but the business was definitely not where the map said it was. Instead we drove around a little and found it on the SE corner of Dobson and Guadalupe!  So we drive up and park.... only to discover that it was CLOSED!!  I'm not sure if you were closed down or renovating, but there was no way for me to find out!   \n\nOh Abbey Gardens~ I was hoping for a lovely afternoon tea but was sorely disappointed.

<review>How dare they put rye seeds on an everything bagel? I'm not happy about dealing with that party foul at all or the rude, inefficient service. Plus, even though they are boiled here, these are not good bagels at all,  even if the rye seeds were not present. Other issue is the bagel bins are far away from customers eyes - what are hiding - put the bins up front like every true NY bagel shop. Hey, if your gonna call yourself a NY bagel place (yes I am from NY) then I want the whole experience. Charging $11 for a turkey sandwich is a bit much too and this is an unfriendly, cold location with no charm. There was a very hairy bird outside though looking for crumbs and on this day that bird got lucky. Onto the next place.

<review>"""Erich Kritemeyer, Is the worse customer service person in the business, he was horrible. Tripped over his own verb age did not know the contract. Could not explain why he did not have an answer but he sure wanted to sell me a phone. That was the answer just buy a new phone we will give you a deal. I already had an iphone and I was unable to get the device turned on and it is because of some red tape no one had any paper work on that would produce a decision. every one said it was illegal to have possession of the phone but when I produced a police report I bought the phone they shut up. I also went to a different store where they printed off a duplicate recite and they were not happy because for every answer they had I had a point they were wrong.I also had them lookk in the records and see I purchased the iphone. He then began quoting me the law I said thats not whats in the report unless you have law enforcement degree you should not quote the law. I reminded him he could not even quote the liability clause he was so sure to stand by but could not prove he was right. I asked if while I was in the store could I call the customer service line they said yeah. He cut me off from the call. I have no idea why. the manager had to come over an reconnect the call. I told Erich I felt like i was in a circle jerk and he said first of all that language is not allowed. I said what language. He said I do not like your language I am offended. I looked right at him and said is it Erich (wanting to make sure I pronounced his name correct) What are your referring to when you say language. Because I call customer service they tell me to come here I come here you tell me to call customer service to me that is a circle jerk. he said I was offending him I said this whole situation is offensive to me!  Your lack of customer service is offensive. I paid good money for a phone i cannot turn on because of a legality which is really just an ethical decision that no one wants to make because there is no clarification on the liability clause you have just surfaced. I realize that is a new thing for this company but it is well defined your employees both front and back office as they were termed to me would not and could not produce any paper work substantiating the fact I could not get a new number linked to my device. But they were all too happy to allow me to purchase a new phone. Is this how Verizon does business this seems like a close fine line to extortion to me.\nAre managers or store owners  like Erich the new faces of sell sell sell. Why was someone allowed to procure a line from my plan when they were not financially sound to do so. Isn't that how the housing market got in this fix. Now that the person ha had a change in heart and will no longer make payments on his line and hasn't for some time I am locked out of a device. i offered to take back over the line and resume liability of the line in question. I just wanted to use my phone. I was told over the phone by customer service on more than one occasion that it is a simple switch of the number he continues to pay on the number and a new number is put on my device. this old number is put on \blank device\"""".  Or in Mr. Motts case the number is not being paid on and you guys can deal with that. \nHe was a former Verizon wireless service manager and manipulated the system. I realize he is not employed there any more and I realize you may never employ him again but why must i suffer in the after math. is that the plan sell phones to people and not allow them to use them. There was no clause saying I resend my permission. I did it with in the allowed 60 days as I was quoted on the phone. This should of been a easy reversal. once I said that, Erich said it was 30 days once I said fine the original request to resend was now 7 days ago I have been doing this all week well with in the 30 days allowed and not all the notes have made it in the system. Erich then told me 14 days. Really!???! Had a thought quick enough and I said I did it 10 days after I sent it would he then have said 9 days.... please this is just one small example of how horrible Erich knew the Verizon policy and how disengaging he was on the store site. when he wasn't trying to argue the law with me he was hiding in back wouldn't come out and talk with me. Erich had Ayham the manager do most of the talking. Ayham wanted to help wanted to work it out and  also wanted to sell a phone as a LAST resort.\nAt one point Erich's hands were shaking should I have been worried that his lack of responsibility and convoluted explanation of policy which could not be physically produced would of turned violent. Or was was he just nervous because he was lying and I was on the verge of getting a clue about all the legal convolution being dispensed in my direction to try and get my to buy a new phone.\nBottom line is an easy credit check would of shown Mr. Mott was incapable of accepting a second line when he could not afford the first."""""""

<review>I came into town for a show and was excited to try a gluten free friendly restaurant. I could have not been more disappointed. Since I notice most reviews of this place are very positive and extremely long I'll try to be direct and to the point. \nService was incredibly slow. We waited a long time for food and to pay our bill. I noticed everyone waiting a long time for their food and when stuff came out it was in odd bursts. \nAtmosphere was some what pretentious and for the food I ate not at all warranted.\nFood was uninteresting and mediocre. I ordered the grass fed burger medium rare on a gluten free bun. The burger was preformed and nowhere near medium rare.  They way this place markets itself I was expecting something fresh and well prepared. Instead I got something I'm pretty sure had been frozen in the shape in which it was cooked and brought to me. I wouldn't be surprised if the whole meal was cooked in a microwave. The bun was gluten free bread which is okay someplace that doesn't use the word bun on their menu. My friend's pizza we also compared to frozen pizza cooked in a microwave.\n\nI love food and have eaten at amazing gluten free and other health conscious restaurants  in many cities so I think I can be a good judge. This place failed for me in every possible way except in cleanliness. But if you told me they were cooking frozen food in a microwave in the apartment next door and then bringing it over, I wouldn't be the least surprised.

We got there at 6:15 and settled in at a table with two chairs.  The waitress came over and said they wanted to keep that table for four people and asked us to move, which we said we liked the table and wanted to be near the music.  She was not happy, but we were and most places the customer is right (not here!).\n\nWe have always been amazed this place is still in business as the staff and owner always seem grumpy and unfriendly.\n\nIn a nutshell......the service was very slow and unfriendly, the entertainment finally started playing at 7:15 and were awful!  Both singers were off key and most songs boring.  After hunting down our waitress and asking to have our order taken, our food finally arrived (cold) an hour after it was ordered, it was so dark we couldn't see what we were eating and we couldn't eat fast enough to get out of there and get away from the whole scene.  \n\nOne of the waiters, was in such a frenzy, running back and forth that just watching him wore us out.  He was really wired.\n\nOur experience was more of the same and this time we will not go back.  Instead, dinner on our own lovely patio, with our choice of music and tranquility.  \n\nYou can keep your Vu!

<review>"""The only way to have a good time at Junkie is to get there early and snag a table, or be a hot 20 year old and butter up the bouncer... and then the bartender when you get inside.   If either of those doesn't work for you, then plan on waiting in a long line and getting terrible service at the bar.    Don't let my opening statement steer you away, there is potential for a good time here.  Of the handful of times I've subjected myself to the low scale, high priced, barely 20 something bar, I've had fun twice.   The key both of those times was getting a table!! The waitress counts on you for her tips, so she will be attentive and she has \pull\"""" with the bartender so you can get your drinks way quicker.   Every time I've had to go to the bar, I've been completely ignored. Now, I'm no supermodel, but I'm not too sore on the eyes either... not even my D cups worked!  At our last visit we actually ordered some appetizers, they were just okay, but exactly what I would expect from bar food.  I struggle with my rating because I would give Junkie a 3 for the two times I had a good experience, but 1.5 for the others.  I guess that tells me that my fellow yelpers have done us solid with a current rating of 2.5."""""""

<review>The service here is horrible! I've had better at McDonalds. For being a restaurant in The Phoenician, I expected better service. It was as quiet as a library. It was a 4 hr dinner that shouldve been 2. We asked for a sommelier to come to give us a wine suggestion... Finally we just picked it ourselves. The food was ok. There's so many better places in Scottsdale. If you are here from out of town (I am a local), I suggest leaving The Phoenician to get much better service and food elsewhere. I'm giving it two stars only because the bunnies were cute that were running around.

<review>Dude. Why are they such jerks? Total attitude from the time I walked in to paying the bill. I ordered a sandwich and the guy behind the counter gave me some meal deal with half a sandwich. Then when I asked why I only was given 1/2 sandwich the woman at the register said something to the man in a different language, he said something back to her, she rolled her eyes and put out her hand to accept my credit card. I was almost going to tell them where to stick their 1/2 sandwich but i had read good things on here about the food so I took it and left.\n\nFood was meh. Bread was cold and stale. Pastrami was nothing special. Don't bother.

<review>"""Just today I called to see if I could bring in my scrubs to see if they could get altered. I got a phone call experience I will never forget. I asked the lady (Chinese/Japanese race might I add) if I could bring in my pants to get altered today and she replied \what you think?\"""" I said I'm not sure that is why I asked. I thought maybe they were too busy today to bring in. I stated, \""""Ok, well how much will you charge to alter one pair of pants?\"""" She replied, \""""A million dollars, what the hell do you think, I don't know until I see.\"""" With her vulgar response, I said ok well I guess I will go elsewhere for my business and she stated, \""""You think I care?

<review>"""I'm still trying to wrap my brain around what happened yesterday. This is technically my second time going to this event... the first time, I was with my girlfriend at the time. Neither of us could handle being there for more than a few minutes, so we got our entry fee refunded and ate at a Mexican food place nearby (which was pretty disgusting if I remember correctly).\n\nThis year, I was determined to check it out. I went with a few friends, and we wisely decided to get drunk before going. \n\nThe Scottsdale Culinary Festival is a misnomer... it's neither culinary, nor a festival. At least it's actually in Scottsdale. It's more like a parade of drunk douchebags. My friend spent the day giddily taking pictures of d-bag shirts and dumb hairstyles. It's very different seeing them outside of the clubs. \n\nThe food here was a joke... mostly chain restaurants. There wasn't anything culinary about it aside from the fact it was food. This city has some amazing unique restaurants, and it seemed like the sampling at the event wasn't representational of the kinds of fantastic \culinary\"""" experiences one can have here.\n\nThere's nothing really festival about this either. It's definitely an event, but apart from security, port-a-pottys, \""""beer gardens,\"""" and wrist bands - it's just some boring food and drink. \n\nMy biggest problem with it is that you have to pay to get in, then you have to buy tickets so you can buy food and drink. They should just raise the price of admission, and have the food be free plus a drink ticket or two. I mean, this should be about restaurants showing off what they can do to get people interested in eating there. \n\nThe vendors at these booths all paid to be here. People pay to get in, and I'm sure the promoter makes a portion of the overall ticket sales. Whoever runs this thing is probably making bank off it. It's a huge sham when you think about it. Red Bull paid a ton to be there and have a premium spot - they weren't even giving their drinks away (which they often do at events like this).\n\nOverall, it was a big joke - but we managed to have fun. It was interesting people-watching, but beyond that there wasn't any reason to come. If I had to do this totally sober, I would've been miserable.\n\nEdit: After browsing the other reviews, it seems like I didn't completely understand the event. I wasn't aware proceeds went to charities, and I didn't see a lot of the restaurants other people listed. I guess at an event like this, everyone is going to have a different experience."""""""

<review>I wish I could give this place five stars, I really do. I've been to all vegan (this place is no, but is close) Chinese restaurants in NY, Philly and Boulder, and was hoping that this would be similar.\n\nIt took us three tries to even get to eat here, as they have odd hours to start with, and seemed to be closed sometimes when their sign said that they should be open.\n\nThe first time, we were the ONLY people in the whole place, and it still took us 45 minutes to get served, and another 20 from when we were done until we could get our check. The second visit, there were other people there, but there were more servers, and it took, no kidding, over an hour to even get our soup. AN HOUR.  Our tea pot and water glasses were empty long before that.\n\nThe food? It's ok.  It's not amazing, but as a vegetarian, it's nice to know that you can eat anything on a menu. The Mushroom Hot Pot was ok but a little bland. I liked the steamed dumplings, but the sauce was a bit odd.\n\nDon't forget the odd TVs all around the place playing interesting cult-like clips about Supreme Master Ching Hai and his biddings. Which is kinda cool to begin with, but when you're sitting there for an hour or two, it gets a bit old.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, but I can't. We won't be going back unless they get a big overhaul.

<review>"""I don't ask for much. When I order a sandwich, I ask for no onions or tomatoes, depending on what the item includes. 9 times out of 10, it arrives with the offending fruit/vegetable in its full glory. I politely remind the cashier of my order, get a polite apology and the food is remade, sometimes just by scraping off whatever I had originally requested not to get in the first place. Tomatoes leave \guts\"""" all over the sandwich when removed, but I hate to waste food or be rude so I suffer in silence. I'm tired of this dance; the food is ok if you get what you ordered, but I never do, so I think I'm done for a while."""""""

<review>"""The first time I went to this place, I got a veggie yakisoba.\nI was very impressed that their vegetables seem to be cooked from fresh, not frozen. I also really like that they have a smaller size option about half the size of your usual styrofoam box. It was greasier than I care for, but that is a common issue with fast food yakisoba noodles.\n\nThe second time I went I got a tofu veggie thing over rice. I was starving so I thought it was great, until I came across a piece of chicken in it. Regardless of being vegetarian, meat does need to be stored seperately to be sanitary, so this is worrisome. My boyfriend ate the rest of it and said he thought it was \ok\"""" but he would've rather had something else. \n\nI really wanted to like this place since its so convenient for me, but I won't be eating there again."""""""

<review>I've been here twice, which was obviously enough. The first time was in 2002, before I was old enough to drink legally. It became obvious to me then that state fairs are only fun for people over 21 or under 12.\n\nIn 2008, I came with some friends who bought a $6 hamburger at one of the tents, took one bite, and threw it in the trash. One of them remarked later that it was the only time in his life he'd spit food out in disgust. While this was happening, another friend and I asked a toothless Vietnam veteran manning another tent where we could find the nearest restroom. His reaction suggested that we were insane for asking such a ridiculous question; we surmised that perhaps, due to some bizarre war injury, he had not taken a piss since 1973. Bottom line, customer service is not high on the priority list at the state fair. Nor is edible food.

<review>"""I'll be honest. Einstein Bros Bagels in Tempe is my typical go-to breakfast spot. I can walk there, it's always full of friendly faces, and it usually produces pretty great, affordable bagels and coffee. What's not to like!? Last week I stopped by for a last minute bagel on my way to work and was extremely disappointed by the service I experienced. I ordered my usual egg white and cheddar sandwich on an \everything\"""" bagel to go. I paid, took a seat, and waited while my order was completed on a busy Friday morning. I watched the bagel-guru slice my bagel, stick it through the toaster, and promptly drop it on the ground. After some swearing under her breath I sat back and patiently continued to wait...I wasn't in a huge hurry. She put a new bagel in the toaster and I watched as after 10 seconds or so...it ignited in flames! I saw her whack it a few times to put the fire out, and saw her put in a new bagel. \n\nUnfortunately when I got to work and unwrapped my long-awaited breakfast, I discovered that the bagel-burner had assembled my sandwich on the victim of the toaster fire. The sandwich was charred, crispy, and tasted like I had taken a spoon to what was left of a campfire after a night of s'mores. \n\nOverall, Einstein's produces good food fairly quickly and for a good price...but lately I've had some not-so-positive experiences. I am a sucker for service, and you can bet I'll be letting another neighborhood bagel joint make my breakfast from here on out."""""""

<review>"""So much potential, yet so lacking -- especially when compared to the timeless awesomeness of brother AZ88.  Everyone else has summarized some of the low points (e.g., low energy).  I'll just recount a ridiculous interaction with a large man who I think is the manager.\n\nThis place seems to be very proud of its prosciutto.  Fair enough.  I ordered a couple of things with the prosciutto, like the prosciutto-wrapped shrimp.  After tasting it cooked and wrapped around the shrimp, I wanted to taste it on its own.  But we had already ordered drinks and plenty of food.  We were sitting at the bar when the manager came over to slice some prosciutto.  A few scraps fell on a plate; I asked him to try a tiny taste.\n\nSure, that's not a normal request at a restaurant, but it's not totally out of line, either, especially for something like cured meat.  He snapped back at me, \This is very expensive.  If you want it, order it and pay for it.\""""  I thought he was joking.  He wasn't.  I thought that reaction was uncalled for.  It's very expensive?  Give me a break; it's on the menu for $4.95.\n\nThe manager cemented my impression of him as a loser when he talked complained about another server to the bartender, within earshot of me and everyone else at the bar.  He called him lazy and \""""not all there\"""" because he couldn't understand some people's orders.\n\nThat's a discussion to take in the back, not at the bar in front of customers.  And please, get off your high horse about your $4.95 prosciutto."""""""

<review>"""Arrived midweek at 12:30pm.... The fact that the pplace was deserted should have been warning enough, but we had faith in the Yelp reviews and the sticker on the door from Yelp  and  advertising the best carne asada this side of the border. The carne asada burrito was mostly tasteless, and certainly NOT worth the $8 I was charged for it. Drink choices are limited to bottled Mexican sodas  and  lemonade or iced tea. Complimentary chips and salsas, on the surface, are a nice add, but the store bought corn chips were stale  and  the salsas not very good at all.\nI think that \this side of the border\"""" refers to the border between them  and  the closest Filibertos. Honestly, I have had much better carne asada burritos from Ralphs Rolling Snack Bar  and  Filibertos, for much less money. I would almost bet that the Coco's in the same plaza could serve up better carne asada.\nThe one redeeming factor was that my friend said his fish taco was very good... Otherwise, I would grant zero stars."""""""

<review>Would you like bad service, long wait times for your food and a big glob of grisly fat in your steak quesadilla? Then this is the place for you. But wait..you get more, a large amount of hummus with a very small amount of pita and when you ask for more pita you get charged for it.  The hummus and pita proportions are off by 100%.  Come on Eddie $2 for an extra pita when there is not enough on the plate to begin with..really??  The most disappointing part of our meal was the lack of concern by our waitress, my friend almost threw up after chewing on the large piece of fat and she didn't even ask us if we wanted anything else, if she could get us anything..she only charged us for the pita and forgot to take the quesadilla off our bill.  But she was very quick to grab the quesadilla off our table after seeing the piece of fat. Bad service. Bad food. Bad time.

<review>Oh Sprinkles. When I moved right around the corner from you, I was SO excited. I got you pretty often (considering the secret code to get a free daily cupcake and being that close, how could I pass it up?!) but the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to stay away. I have since tried other local cupcake bakeries, a few not so good and a few were amazing. I had my last Sprinkles Cupcake I will ever eat today, Sprinkles continually has hard, dry cupcakes and I am over spending $3+ for 1 cupcake. Not worth the hype, and I feel as if the girls who work here don't know how to smile (a little customer service goes a long way ladies  and  gents!). Sad really, I used to adore this place so much. I am giving it 2 stars only because they do offer the daily secret word to get a freebie.

<review>This place is located next door to a nail salon.  The smell is overwhelming.  The acetone and other strong chemicals used at that salon carry over into the restuarant.  I am sorry for them.  We were there 8/15/11 for happy hour.  Food was average.  Service was average.  All just average.  I think others give this place high stars because they have no other sushi options in this area.  They don't know what they are missing.  There is nothing special about Yen.  And the chemical smell from their neighbor was so strong that we will never go there again.  I don't know who was there first, but if Yen wants to stay, I hope the nail place relocates.

I took a verrrry big hit for the Mesa/PHX yelpers in going here. I'm surprised I didn't get food poisoning. The place is disgustingly filthy. The tables were sticky and from a distance they all looked clean until you sat down. I wanted to cry. I really did. It's such a huge contrast to the other fast food restaurant I went to.\n\nBooths were unstable as was the clientele. I felt really overdressed in my grubby jeans and grubby shirt.\n\nThe cashier and the servers were friendly and nice...I think they realized I was the only customer that wasn't high on something. I was truly disturbed by some of their patrons - they were walking adverts for \DON'T DO DRUGS\"""".\n\nI think this KFC/A and W really killed any and all future KFC cravings. I said that this place wasn't good for kids - mostly because I'm worried they'll catch next year's strain of the flu - yup, if you want to get your immune system up, come here. \n\nOk, going to go shower now that I remember what this place was like. *shudders*"""""""

This most recent time, beverages took forever, the server didn't know how to properly open a bottle of wine (thank goodness this one server whom I've seen bust his butt a couple times before helped us out) and I got a spotted glass that I ended up polishing myself.   She was nice enough and never ever rude or short-tempered but blonde hair and a short shirt doesn't get a great tip from me.  Prompt service does. We waited quite a long time for our check then to have the check processed and then even longer for a to-go box.  It's ok for me and my hubby but I don't take any out-of-town visitors there.  There are too many other options in that area that appreciate their guests and always are looking for ways to Wow them... in a good way.  These guys \Wow\"""" me every time... but in a bad way.

<review>Out of my desperation for needing a seafood fix in Tempe one night, the boyfriend and I went to King's. It was a brand I was familiar with so I thought it would be good...the result? Very over-priced, over-cooked, bland seafood. Fish and chips were not nearly as good as George and Dragon, the shrimp was rubbery, and the clam chowder tasted like it was from a can. The only good thing about the meal was the complimentary sourdough bread and the servers were very nice and friendly. Not impressed.

I could do that! I got the Kitchen Sink salad (had greens, carrots, chickpeas, black beans, jicama, broccoli, mango, and candied walnuts that weren't candied.) that sounded good, but was okay. The roasted butternut squash appetizer quite honestly was the most boring thing I've ever eaten. \n\nI sampled my fianc\u00e9's food and it mostly tasted like allspice and not much else (he got the quinoa salad, wild rice, and southwestern soup).

<review>"""***AVOID THIS SANDWICH SHOP***\n\nFirst of all the main reason to not support this Capriottis is the poor management/ownership. If you care about being treated right as a customer, being valued for your business and overall being treated respectfully by a business... DO NOT GO HERE.\n\nHere's my story...\nCapriotti's food in general as a chain sub shop can be very good. In fact I have ate there several times in the past, mostly from another location. But it is more expensive as some of the other posters have remarked. (So you'd like to get what you pay for correct? Certainly you can... BUT NOT HERE)\n\nThis location created a texting system for deals etc.. (I believe to drum up business when it's slow). They say in it \UPSIDE ANY SANDWICH to a 20: FOR THE PRICE OF A SMALL\"""".

He absolutely understood the confusion but WOULD NOT HONOR THE TEXT??? I asked him whether he'd rather lose return customers and have bad business in the future over his mistakes rather than rectify them on this one time basis. He had no interest in making things right. As I've read from other posters from a while back this ownership has no clue and hopefully we will all stand and let him know that businesses like this shouldn't be rewarded."""""""

<review>Big let-down. The concept of the really cold beer is great, but it ends there. Service is horrible and it comes with horrible attitude. Food was okay. We got a really bad table with a glare from the sun and you couldn't see. Server said that she was really sorry she couldn't do anything about that. As I looked at the 4 - 5 empty tables around us we got up and left. It would have been so easy to offer us a new table and the bad one probably would have been fine in 20 minutes or less as the sun shifted. \n\nNo food on the patio?  Really, in AZ?  And apparently it's serve yourself at the standing tables. The 7 somewhat attractive girls standing around couldn't be bothered to take an order. A restaurant like that shouldn't have any area other than the bar (where you have a bartender) that doesn't have service. \n\nTwin Peaks has it all wrong.  It needs to be about the customer and great service, not just the novelty of the views....

<review>"""As someone who has had working experience in the airline industry on the scheduling and pricing end, I feel I can't gripe about the usual boohoos everyone else has about the airline industry. To clear up a few things to express my point: \n\n-Long lines: this is a part of going to the airport. Get over it or deal with the several-times-longer method of surface transit\n-Delays: this is another part of the airport experience. So what if it's sunny and gorgeous outside. Your flight began in Atlanta, where there are thunderstorms and tornadoes. \n-Cranky people: air travel may not be as easy as you think. In the year 2009, the questions people still ask surprise me. *Fun Fact: Did you know an E-ticket is exactly that? An ELECTRONIC ticket. Yeah, you can book travel and go to the airport with nothing but your government-issued ID and you'll get a boarding pass. You REALLY don't need anything else. Little kinks in the grand system and little things happening in people's lives can make them a bit cranky\n-Uncomfortable seats: airplanes are metal tubes run by people who want to cram as many people in as possible in order to make a profit. This is a capitalist society and that's just part of it. Lower-quality seats are cheaper to purchase than plush velvet.\n\nThat and more make up the curse of air travel. Now, I will focus specifically on Southwest. They are a \closet hub-and-spoke\"""" airline, as in they consider themselves point-to-point. I will admit that they do offer a fair selection of some point-to-point routes. However like all airlines they have hubs and focus cities, Phoenix being one of their hubs. This means that it is likely that if you live here, or visit here frequently, you will use it for a domestic flight. They are decent for Vegas or Southern California cities, but aren't a great option for many large cities east of Arizona, especially those with two or more commercial airports, as they typically service the most inconvenient ones for vacations, such as BWI, Dallas Love, Chicago Midway or MacArthur Islip on Long Island. \n\nTheir flight attendants remind me of preschool teachers and it seems they get end-of-the-year bonuses for acting like clowns. They're nice and friendly, but a bit overly perky and bubbly. The unassigned seating is a fiasco and this airline more than any other American carrier seems to be the de facto family carrier. I haven't been on any other carrier that attracts as many children, and I've been on a long list from American to Continental, from Cathay Pacific to Thai, from Asiana to AirFrance. Southwest  does offer competitive rates, but you will get what you pay for, including a flying day care and mystery seat. The whole A,B,C boarding process is ridiculous, as you really have no say in where you sit. For a weekend trip to Vegas or Southern California, from Phoenix, your options are US Airways, Southwest or United Express (LAX only) and in my opinion, unless Southwest offered an unbeatable deal, I would pay a little more to take either of the other two.\n\nI could prattle on about specific experiences, though those could happen on any airline. In short, the structure and policies of Southwest are its weakest points. I will say that it isn't the worst airline I've ever been on (Aeroflot is the absolute worst and most likely will always be the absolute worst) but I would definitely look at other options, even choosing a layover on a different carrier though Southwest might offer a non-stop option. As I said before, I would fly it again, but only if the difference in fare between it and its competition was significantly lower."""""""

<review>I read the previous review on here and I wanted to go here and prove him wrong. Unfortunately, I couldn't. I really wanted to like this place but it just wasn't happening. Now I do think that the previous reviewers rating of one star was a bit extreme, because it's not that bad, but it's not good either. Something about the place is just off. The food court setting isn't bad really, it's just the way things were done. First off, they asked if I wanted iced tea or something else when I had already asked for tea, just the regular tea that every dim sum place across the country gives you usually without even asking. The tea itself was a bit off too. As for the carts it was just the same three carts for the duration of our thirty minute stay. I got the baked char siu bun and the siu mai. Everything looked pretty unappetizing except for the pastries and these noodles the ladies at the table behind us had. The bun I had was alright, but the pork filling was totally sub-par. The siu mai was not very good either. Also, the chile oil on the table had an off consistency too. Like I said before I really wanted to like this place but I just can't. I will try it again in a few weeks because I'm hoping that they figure out what they're doing wrong and fix it because this place has great potential.

<review>"""Nice decor, mediocre food.  Shrimp tacos should not be served in a deep fried corn tortilla with two small shrimp each.  Rip off comes to mind.  Excessive raw garlic in the black beans made them inedible, and I LOVE garlic.  The ceviche was just weird--6\ strips of fish that were very difficult to maneuver. I tried cutting it to a manageable size in the serving bowl and wound up spilling it all over the table.  And it was ridiculously expensive.  By the way, Restaurant 101 tells you appetizers are to be served before the entrees.  All courses came out together.  Unless they change their menu and techniques, we can expect this experiment to be short lived."""""""

<review>"""I'm torn on Sacks.  I love the concept, but each time I pick up a sandwich here, it never lives up to this idea that I have in my mind.  Something is always off.  The most common complaint stems from the greasy, buttery sensation present in most of the breads.  They frequently remind me of a grilled cheese sandwich gone bad, with a few toppings to mix it up.  The chicken soup is bland and in general, I find it a mediocre lunch spot.\n\nThe \art\"""" theme on the menu is adorable and perhaps that's why I expect it to be a bit better.  While I know some people grump about it, I'm a huge fan of the artisan breads and in my head, Sacks should be on top of this.  The few baguettes they serve are awesome.  The sandwich names are cute, but reality doesn't quite measure up.\n\nOccasionally, I'll have luck off of the specials menu.  They seem to have a better, fresher selection and it's by far the best option.  I'm still not completely satisfied with this and tend to only go when tagging along with a friend or co-worker.\n\nSacks is usually crowded around lunchtime, but they take phone orders.  If orders meet a minimum, they're also able to deliver.  The service has always been quick despite the massive flood of people they get, and I have no complaints about the human interaction.\n\nThe most fabulous thing about Sacks?  The delicious and perfect chocolate chip cookie that's included with your meal."""""""

<review>"""I wish they had a \0\"""" star option too!\n\nThe service and food was awful. Just a bunch of kids running the place.  The place closes at 10pm but when we went in there at 8pm all the workers were too busy cleaning to go home early to help us.  The food was burnt  on one side and raw on the other. The manager was too busy flirting with the other help. We couldn't get drinks because all the glasses where dirty, we were told by our waitress. We asked for the manager before we left at 8:45 and was told he already went home for the evening. What kind of manager leaves a bunch of teenager to run the place? \n\nNEVER GOING BACK!!!!"""""""

<review>Here's the quick and dirty (keep in mind that I give some leeway when reviewing airport food versus normal food):\n\nPros:\n-quick service\n-great place if you want to catch a game\n-really impressed with free wifi at PHX\n-For folks who need to charge their computer during their downtime, there are outlets on some of the corner tables\n\nCons:\n-burger was mediocre and you'd expect them to have burgers nailed at least (choice was b/w medium well and well which should have been a sign). this may be the best PHX has to offer, but I doubt it.\n\nWould recommend trying somewhere else.

<review>This place has been my favorite on on every Tuesday, and I have never had any problems at all until last Tuesday!\n\nThere were 3 of us went to the restaurant together, and we were told that we had to wait at least 45mins for the next table available. Ok fine, we guess we just needed to hang around until we were called.\n\nHowever, 30mins came by and we came in and check - There were several booths and tables were available. The hostess refused to sit us because the kitchen was busy and there were not a lot of servers. She asked us to wait another one hour!\n\nOne hour? I mean really?  It was freaking 9pm and we were starving! All of us were pissed, left the place and went to Kona Grill which had so much better options....\n\nThey need to do something about it - I mean Tuesday is Wings Night and they expected it not to be busy? Heck no!

<review>"""I am NEVER returning to this market again!  It's a shame, because I live in the neighborhood and would prefer to shop here.\n\nThe plastic bags at the self-check were all stuck together and the register scale kept locking up, requiring a checker's code to release it.  My husband was trying to straighten the bags all out, but no luck.  The jerk that helped me had the audacity to say to me, \You have to be smarter than the equipment.\""""  I couldn't believe it.  I so badly wanted to punch the little F*)($#% in the throat!!  My husband couldn't believe that I didn't walk out and leave the crappy groceries there.  \n\nI have found that the fresh fruit and veg isn't that fresh.  I have only been buying bread/milk for some time.  Until today.  We spotted a watermelon that looked great and bought it.  I washed it and cut into it when we got home. It was rotten on the inside.  I know it happens every now and then, and normally, we would just throw it away and not buy produce here at all any more.\n\nIn light of our experience, my husband took the damn rotten thing back to the store and got my money back.  The rude little jerk was nowhere to be found.  (He needs a tune up for sure.)  A nice young man helped my husband.  My husband got the impression that he knew who he was complaining about and had heard it a few times.  \n\nNEVER SHOPPING AT \""""ROTTEN n RUDE\"""" again !!"""""""

<review>Three of us went to Fresh Mint today for lunch.  We did not like it.  We started with an order of Summer Rolls.  Yuck, they were a piece of tofu and shredded cabbage rolled in rice paper, served with a thick, unappealing peanut sauce studded with raw peanuts. Presentation was nice, but it did not taste like anything except cabbage wrapped in rice paper.  My companions each ordered Pad Thai and I had the Five Spice Pho.  The Pad Thai arrived first. I looked at it and was very happy I did not order it.  It looked like a plate of gummy sauce-covered glop.  Tasted as bad as it looked. My Five Spice Pho looked delicious, but did not have any flavor.  Adding the hot sauce that is served on the side, only added heat, but no flavor.  The broth tasted like water.  We did like the Mint Lemonade, but at $3.95 a glass, it was pretty pricey.  Our lunch bill came to $44.  Very expensive for what we were served.\n\nNeedless to say, I am crossing Fresh Mint off my list.  No reason to go back.  I gave it 2 stars out of respect for the Yelpers that think it is so great, but actually, I would rather give it one.  Vegetarian does not have to be bland and tasteless.

<review>This place has great decor and some smokin servers from time to time, but the food and prices have been a disappointment on every occasion.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I have given this place a chance over the past 4 or more years. On some occasions we were there for a birthday, and on other occasions just to grab a quick bite.\n\nThe dishes which contain chicken breast have always been overcooked and very dry. As for the Sushi rolls, they are far from the best, and certainly nothing special. On occasion they have a rendition of ceviche or a squid salad which both sound promising. Once again on each occasion, the presentation was there, but the portions were very small, certainly didn't taste like anything that was satisfying, and the price tag was insulting for what we had.\n\nThe only reason that I go to this place at all now, is to grab a quick drink if I'm walking around the area.\n\nThis is one of those places that creates the stereotypical Scottsdale image, just as RA does just up the street. It's a place to say that you ate at if you want to be a stereotypical, brain dead, Scottsdale doucher. The fact that you consider it to be the best means one of the following:\n\n1.) You were extremely fortunate and your food was prepared and presented to perfection.\n\n2.) You have no idea what good sushi consists of, and are probably a huge fan of California, Las Vegas, or Godzilla rolls.\n\nor\n\n3.) You are a young blonde bombshell with no brain who thinks that it's cool to eat Sushi because you are a sheep and think that everything that you see on 'Keeping up with the Kardashian's' is what real life is all about. (or because you watch some other BS show on MTV and are influenced by the complete ass hats with no brains).\n\nEither way, this place is typically a terrible place to go and eat if you want to enjoy good Sushi, Sashimi, etc.\n\nThey do have a nicely decorated interior and sit at a nice location in old town.\n\nIf you're dating a younger girl with her head in the clouds she will love this place! =)\n\nSorry for the rant and ill painted picture, you can see that I'm over the Scottsdale illusion and have no tolerance for it...\n\nIf you are in the area, I would hit Kyoto or Pearl before this place, but a quick drive to Missouri and 7th ave will get you the best Sushi experience with a decent price tag.\n\nCheers and much luv! =)\n\nFYI...I'm certainly not hating on blonde females, I love them to death as long as they don't fit into that superficial stereotype.

<review>Aunt Chilada's at the Pointe is more about atmosphere than food.  It has a good happy hour, but the food is pretty pedestrian.  I was forced to edit and downgrade my rating because of my most recent visit.  Though the service was quite good, the food was horrific. \n\nWas there again recently with some folks from work. It was chosen since it was close to the hotel our corporate visitors were staying. I decided to forgo the usual safe burro and try the chile relleno and the spinach enchilada. O...M...G...what a mistake.  The spinach enchilada consisted of a limp tortilla filled with frozen spinach and covered in a sauce that if it wasn't from a can was seasoned with tin...ha...ha. The relleno was stuffed with queso, breaded, deepfried, covered with the same tin flavored sauce, which in turn was then covered again with rubbery white cheese. Oh boy!  What a treat!  After this meal I have made a vow to never to stray from a burro here again. \n\nSo, if you plan on getting together with a big group for Happy Hour, Aunt Chilada's is an OK choice.  If you are looking for truly top flight Mexican food, there are other places that may be more appropriate.

<review>So I usually try not to eat sushi in cities so far from the coast. But we came here for my bachelorette party because one of my friends has celiacs and can't eat gluten anything. So Japanese tends to be safest for her.\n\nThe sushi wasn't bad.. I didn't get sick so thats a plus! I did venture into some raw fish and it was okay. Not fresh like what you get in SF.. but okay. But really.. for the price, I'd never go back.. its super expensive for what you get. And my teeny bottle of sake was double what it would have been at a restaurant in SF (and triple just buying it at a store).\n\nThe staff was nice, everything looked pretty. But two stars because I have experienced better.. a lot and I will probably never go back.

<review>"""Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.\n\nI already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.\n\nI walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. \n\nI didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. \n\nSoon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.\n\nWe all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. \n\nI told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.\n\nSince it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.\n\nThings quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.\n\nIn the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, \You can have whatever you want.\""""\n\nI was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. \n\nSlightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)"""""""

<review>This was the worse spa experience I have ever had!!  When I checked in I gave the front desk my spa gift certificate that was given to me as a gift.  I told the guy at the front desk that the gift certificate was a couple of years old.  The guy told me he would take care of it and off I went to my facial.  The facial was nice.  The locker room was unremarkable.  Once my treatment was done I went to check out and the woman at the front desk told me that they would not accept my gift certificate, that it had expired.  In this day and age I was shocked!!!  I felt as though I had never had a treatment at all!!!  The staff did not care and did not try to make me happy!! \n\nI am a full-time resident and I always go to The Phoenician but I thought that I would give The Sanctuary a try. \n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone!!

<review>Have you seen American Psycho? Set in the 1980s, every character is obsessed with what restaurants are hot, and which are totally over. Everything about AZ 88 made me think of that film, and how they'd be firmly in the latter category. \n\nTo be fair, I was only here as an evening drinking destination and not for dinner, but I was shocked at how 80s the place felt (even the name is 88!) and also how empty it was. Typically I'm a big fan of specialty handcrafted cocktails, and their entire list was pretty underwhelming. It certainly didn't seem current. \n\nPatrick Bateman would be horrified to be here. I'd just be incredibly apathetic to return.

<review>I visited a couple times about 25 years ago, when my future wife was infatuated with one of the bartenders. TeePee seemed reasonably satisfying back then and I cant decide if tastes have changed that much or the food has objectively fallen off a cliff. \n\nIt may be a little of both. \n\nTable service was friendly but inattentive, if that makes sense.  Decor is Flintstones meets Happy Days on the Oregon Trail. Or something.  Which would be fun....if the food was edible.  Prices run a buck or two higher than many Mexican chains; again, reasonable only if the food was better. Or even as good, as BajaFresh, Taco Bell or Chipotle. \n\nIn this industry, there's a thin line between venerable charm and past- its-prime trap, and if you insist on lousy ingredients and dont bother to ask customers how they want their heuvos cooked, then even if your front hostess is a doll, you're on the wrong side of that line.

<review>"""Everything was okay here accept the terrible customer service.  I had to rent a tux for my boyfriend for my mothers wedding.  When I called to get a price they told me that I needed to place my order at least two weeks ahead in order to ensure that it arrived on time, so we went down that day and ordered.  \nTwo weeks had passed and I called to make sure that it had arrived which they replied that it had not.  I was not too worried at this point because we still had a week before the wedding.\nI continued calling thought the week before the day that were scheduled to leave had come and we still had no tux.  When I called that day she said that the deliveries had not come yet and that they would call them to see if they had and call me back.  Well they never called me back so we drove down there. \nAs we arrived they looked nervous to see us but took us to the back room to try on the tux that we ordered because apparently it had come (but why did she not call me back?)\nMy boyfriend barely squeezed into this tux.  It was tight around the neck and when he knelt down it felt and looked like it was going to split.  \nWhen we voiced our concerns to the woman working there (she is the owner), she got this snotty attitude and acted like we were absolutely ridiculous for wanting a tux that fit comfortably.  When my boyfriend showed her how tight it was when he knelt down she replied,  \Well I don't know why you would be doing that at a wedding so....\"""".\nMy boyfriend told her, \""""Well what if I'm dancing and want to move around a little?\""""\nAnd she responded, in the snottiest way possible\""""I don't know anybody who dances like that.\""""\nI suspect that they took one of the tuxedos off the mannequins and tried to pass it off as the one we ordered.  Especially when they had to send us to another store to pick up a vest that they did not have in the color we wanted.  \nWe ended up using it for the wedding because we did not have another option at this point.\nI would have given this place a better rating if it wasn't for the woman who \""""helped\"""" us.  She was rude, snotty, and she simply did not care.  I have never been treated so poorly anywhere in my life."""""""

<review>Ordered the seafood curry and it looked delicious but tasted very bland, we had to add sugar and fish sauce to make it edible. The pleasant waitress reccomended the spicy chicken as a special whch turned out to be the same sauce and style of Pandas Orange chicken and at $18.00 for orange chicken? Perhaps we came in at a bad day or did not order the right dishes? This place may be over rated. Service was spectacular! Food not!

<review>Oh, brother! The grocery prices here are OBSCENE! Very sad that there is so very little competition in the entire Valley of the Sun for quality food.  I mean, the old co-op way down in Tempe has been gone many years now. And Wild Oats was summarily gobbled up by this multi-national corporate behemoth.  \n\nIn addition to grocery prices, the quality of their deli foods have gone downhill ... that food is now just sort of low frequency, if you know what I mean.  If not, oh well.  \n\nSure, this place is fun. But, really?  I mean REALLY? When you do see comparable items the cost is a full 33 percent more than Trader Joes.  Gag.
</review>
<review>The first thing I noticed was its nice patio area.  The second thing was its stand-in-line order process.  I completely agree with Gabi M, as having to wait until you reach the cashier to ask questions regarding the menu is quite annoying for us, and for the patrons waiting behind us.\n\nMy wife was going to order the Rancher Salad, as it came with  grilled steak and caramelized onions.  Interesting note: the menu doesn't mention that the steak comes pre-grilled, served cold.  Good thing we asked.  Cold meat didn't sound that appetizing, so she deferred to the Liberty Bowl + Pasta.\n\nI was going to order the Salmon Plate but become enamored with the wood fired pizza oven, and went with a Margherita pie.  Good thing!  The salmon comes cured and served cold (the online menu didnt mention that, but the store menu did).  I also ordered a cup of caprese pasta salad.\n\nWhile we waited near a boisterous table, we noticed how loud it can get inside, as it echos.\n\nMy cavatappi pasta in my caprese pasta salad was fairly dry, although it did come with grape tomatoes and tiny balls of fresh Mozzarella cheese which were good.  I wouldn't order it again though.\n\nThe cavatappi pasta also made an appearance in my wife's Liberty Bowl entree.  I would have opted for a penne or spaghetti or linguine, but am sure its much easier on the kitchen to have to prepare one pasta type.  I liked the sauce, but found the meatball to be almost chalky, but definitely crumbly, with a taste reminiscent of Chef Boyardee meat nads.  My wife didn't want to eat them.  I smooshed one on my plate and photographed it for your viewing pleasure.\n\nThe saving grace was their wood fired pizza.  The crust was fantastic.  Thin but not cracker crisp.  It was crisp on the outside, but soft inside, with a great taste.  I highly recommend this menu item.  They used a fresh crushed tomato sauce, which was spot-on.  I commend them for this, as they could have opted for the easy way out, using the Liberty Bowl maranara sauce.\n\nTheir dessert case did not contain many appealing offerings.  Most of them just looked dry.  For example, refer to my photos of the brownies and cinnamon rolls.  I agree with my wife.  If you are going to display something in a case for all to see, make sure its fresh and remains visually appealing.  If you're unable to accomplish this, why have a dessert case?  Where's the allure?\n\nSorry Liberty Market.  Our first trip was very disappointing, which means it will probably be our last.

<review>Every time I've been here, there is a problem. Today, I dropped my car off for an oil change and wash and asked them to call me when it was done. Two hours later (one hour at most was promised) I figured it should be done so I went to pick it up. I got there and payed with no event. It was when I drove down the street that I noticed the car hadn't even been washed! I returned and they said I needed to sign off on a waiver due to a loose piece of plastic under my bumper--no biggie but how was I supposed to know?!  In general, they don't embue trust to me and don't really seem to know what they're doing. \n\nThe manager explained that I needed to sign the waiver PRIOR to them washing my car. So here I sit waiting while they wash my car, yet still haven't signed said waiver?????  Told you, lots of excuses and false promises. I don't even trust they completed the services they signed off on.

<review>"""AAA 4 stars???\n\nI have stayed here numerous times over the years, and it's very consistent.  So why 2 stars?  Ah, because it's been consistently below average.\n\nFirst off, the hotel is open-air and the rooms open to nature, as opposed to an interior corridor.  During the winter, it's not too bad, but when I go during the summer, it sucks - especially right after checking in and having to trek across the sprawling property (nicely manicured, though it may be) in 120 degree weather.  \n\nI also hate the wifi service.  I tend to scoff when a hotel says they have \high speed\"""" Internet because it's usually akin to dial up.  Granted, it's speedier than the 14.4kbs (yes, I'm dating myself), but it doesn't feel a whole lot better.  I'm exaggerating, but if you've ever watched Yelp load over a slow connection, you know my frustration.\n\nAnother issue I have had is the pool.  Well, not the pool in and of itself.  It's the bands that play until midnight or later.  Priceline must hate me, because I'm always stuck with a room by the pool, and always on a night they have a band.  Wouldn't be so bad, except for the fact I'm always there for business and usually have to wake up at 5am the next day.  \n\nNow, I will give this place credit for being a nice plate to rest your head (when the music dies down) and, if you use Priceline, you can end up with a great rate.  However, there are other hotels in the same class and price range that up the ante.  4 stars?  Meh, I've experienced better."""""""

<review>Montelucia Resort in Scottsdale, AZ recommended ExecuCar to take my family and I from Phoenix Airport to the resort. I booked a week in advance as I was flying my mother and sisters in from PA and I was flying in from CA. The morning of travel I received a call from ExecuCar as I was on my way to the airport that they would not be able to fit our bags (which I indicated the total when I made the reservations) and my options were to cancel or pay double and they would accommodate us. I cancelled and booked a midsize car which cost me over $400 for the days wer were at the resort. I was stuck as I was already in route to the airport and booked 8 min before boarding my flight. I can not believe they waited to contact me about this on my way to the airport when i booked days before. I called the resort and said they need to stop recommending this service. When I get to the airport they were there to pick me up because the resort was ready to pay the double fee for me, however at this point I had already pre-paid $400+ for the rental car. This service (ExecuCar) is horrible and did not even ask the size of our bags. We were able to get all of us and our bags into a mid size car. I am a Director of Sales and was excited to use them in the future and was treated so badly and put in a terrible situation by them and under a lot of stress on a holiday weekend.\n\nUse any other service than ExecuCar. Don't put yourself in a difficult situation of booking and them not coming thru for you.

<review>So we went again, we love the patio. This time for drinks and appetizers.  The service was horrible. The drinks good. The hummus a little weird in flavor. Not really Persian and creamy. Lumpy and brownish with too little bread. The pizza was horrible, tiny no flavor, digiorno is better. The lettuce cups were so so, the restaurant seems committed to using something sweet and stcky in everything. I don't know the name of the spice but it smells like potpourri and tastes like room freshner

<review>I used to love this place and would eat there often dealing with hour long waits.  My family loves the rocking chairs and checkers games to play while waiting.  Over the years I had noticed the quality of food was spotting with sometimes good, sometimes bad but we continued to go.  The last time we waited over an hour, the kids were tired and hungry and we were thrilled when we finally got a table.  Being they were so bust service was slow.  We waited forever for drinks and to place our order.  About 40 minutes later our food came.  My daughter was sitting next to me and my son was sitting next to my husband.  My husband has ordered a breakfast meals with everything.  He took a large piece of ham off his plate and gave it to my son.  My son took one bite and said it didn't taste good and he wasn't hungry.  Thinking he was just being difficult, I said he had to eat it.  I watched him gag through another bite and realized something was wrong.  My husband then looked at it and smelled it and the ham was BAD.  I mean really BAD like off color and smelled rotten.  I was in shock.  That could make someone really sick.  We told the waiter who was not surprised at all.  Just offered to take it back and take it off the bill and replace it??   I was shocked and really worried about my son getting sick.  The manager was not concerned and acted like I was overreacting.  \nMy family has never gone back but I was talking with my neighbor the other day and he said the same thing happen to him.  I am not sure how this could happen.  How does bad food get out of the kitchen?  How could no one notice?  I will never go back!

<review>This is my worst experience at a Sonic. The location is hard to reach, the service is real slow and even though it is all set up for a drive-thru, there is no drive-thru window. I felt like I could have gone to Applebees, ordered, ate and left before I got my meal from this Sonic location. If you ever have to endure a meal at this location you may be as shocked as I was at how impossible it seems to be to access - it's almost like they don't want customers.

<review>A group of us went there for the cafe and let the kids looks at the books.  I am just going to review the cafe.  We were all reviewing the menu, I have not been there in a LONG time.  She was very annoyed that we did not know what we wanted.  CHILL!  I ordered a medium green tea latte.  She was very rude and loud, DO YOU HAVE A BORDER'S CARD?  She prepared my drink.  It was so hot, I had to wait 5 full mins before drinking it.  When I picked the cup also thought it was very light.  The cup was only 3/4 filled? WTF?  The drink was good but the service and quantity in the cup was a totally disappointment.

<review>==Honey, Why Do You Hate That Sonic So Much?==\n\nA tragifarce in one act by Jetta\n\n(Drive-Thru at a Sonic. JETTA, a quirky yet attractive woman in her early twenties, sits patiently in her car as the staff inside hustle and bustle to fill her order. She fiddles with the radio. She checks her polish. She turns the car off. A greasy-faced SONIC EMPLOYEE sticks his head out.)\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nHere's your strawberry slush, ma'am.\n\nJETTA\nThank you. Hold on, don't go yet.\n\n(JETTA pops the lid to the slush. The cup is filled ENTIRELY WITH FLAVORLESS ICE.)\n\nJETTA\nThis doesn't look like strawberry. I think you gave me the wrong flavor.\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nNo, actually, by this time of the day the slush machines freeze over, and they all come out like that. \n\nJETTA\nWhy didn't you tell me that twenty minutes ago when I ordered it?\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nDidn't think you would mind.\n\nJETTA\nMind what, being charged a dollar and some change for a cup of blended ice? You knowingly brought this to me and thought it would be acceptable.\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nI wasn't expecting you to check it.\n\nJETTA\nI want another flavor. \n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nOkay.\n\nJETTA\nWait. You're just going to give me another cup of ice.\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nThe machine's frozen. I told you.\n\nJETTA\nJust get me an ocean water. Same size. \n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nSure thing. \n\n(SONIC EMPLOYEE and JETTA exchange cups. She pops open the lid.)\n\nJETTA\nThis is coke. Ocean Waters have sprite.\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nSprite machine's out.\n\nJETTA\nSo you just thought you'd substitute coke and hope I wouldn't notice? \n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE \nCan I get you something else?\n\nJETTA\nYes. Just get me a coke with some vanilla, cherry, and chocolate flavoring. Please. Thank you.\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE \nWill you pull up in one of the spaces and wait in the dining area? You're holding up traffic.\n\n(JETTA parks her car and walks over to the dining area. She fiddles with an item in her purse, visibly trying with little success to restrain her anger. SONIC EMPLOYEE steps out with soda, a smirk on his face.)\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nA coke with vanilla, coke, and chocolate flavoring for the la-\n\n(SONIC EMPLOYEE, now face to face with JETTA, stops in his tracks. JETTA stands a full foot over him, a sneering face atop mannishly broad shoulders. SONIC EMPLOYEE drops the soda to the floor. JETTA looks down. It was water.)\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nSorry. Wrong order. I'll be right back.\n\n(SONIC EMPLOYEE sheepishly returns with another soda. JETTA opens it in front of them, looking inside. She nods, signaling her minimal satisfaction.)\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nHere's your money.\n\n(The SONIC EMPLOYEE hands JETTA a dollar bill and some change. Laughter and stares from the kitchen. The SONIC EMPLOYEE averts his eyes, staring at the spilled cup on the ground below.)\n\nSONIC EMPLOYEE\nHave a good day, ma'am. Thank you for your patience.\n\n(JETTA sashays off to her car, sipping happily at her flavored soda. SONIC EMPLOYEE, sulking, returns to the kitchen to ruin someone else's night.)

<review>"""I purchased a Travelzoo Local Deal for this spa and it included a facial and use of spa facilities. This spa and resort has a stellar reputation and I was very much looking forward to it and had high expectations. I get facials approximately every 2 months and have never encountered the damage inflicted upon my skin as I did yesterday.\nA normal facial typically includes 'extractions' and I always agree to this procedure. I agreed to have the employee perform a few extractions thinking that at a 5 star resort/spa it would be fine. It was far from fine. Typically you are not supposed to 'force' an extraction and most times if it is difficult, they stop. She did major damage to my skin. I left the room with large red welts on my face. I assume she realized what she had done because she kept repeating to me that \those will eventually fade\"""" and kept telling me it's normal. I have never in my life had a facial where I looked worse than when I walk in. I have very clear skin, no acne, no scars and I walked out looking like I was stung by bees. The swelling and redness did eventually go down , but I had to cancel plans that night because of my appearance (yes, vanity kicked in). However upon waking up this morning I have scabs or what appears to look like areas where I\""""ve been 'picking' at my skin. These were the extraction sites. They are not swollen any longer, but are still red and may possibly leave scars. Because they are open areas of my skin, I am hesitant to put makeup on them as I want them to heal properly. I now have to walk around with these scabs on my face. I'm quite upset about this obviously.\nI can't fathom how this place thinks this woman is qualified to give facials, especially where they normally charge $175 for this service. I paid $119 and have damage to my face. While the spa itself was very nice, I was horrified at the appearance of my face and did not enjoy the facilities . On top of that I was forced to pay $45 for gratuity BEFORE I had my treatment. In no way did this woman deserve a tip.. she has damaged my skin!\nWhile the resort and facilities are great, I'd never allow them to touch my face again."""""""

<review>"""Have lived a few blocks from this place for 6 years and have never gone. Saw a Groupon last week and decided to buy it. Thought I'd give it a try. Arrived around 11:30am today with my boyfriend to have lunch. We were the only ones in there. (Maybe about 20 mins later 2 more ppl showed up). Waiter was attentive and immediately brought us menus and took our drink order. I ordered the Shrimp Po'Boy and my b/f ordered the Gyro. As we were waiting on our food I glanced/looked around the restaurant. Taking it all in. Poorly decorated. Could use a deep cleaning. The condiment bottles greasy/sticky with fingerprints. Most of the ketchup bottles on the tables were empty. Also had me wondering if they keep the squeeze ketchup bottles refrigerated at night since they were all dirty and empty. Our food came. Our plates looked appetizing. French fries were soggy and cold. Not crispy whatsoever. The shrimp on my Po'Boy were big. The cornmeal coating on the shrimp was tasty. The hoagie bun was dried out completely. It fell apart or you could say crumbled apart. I ended up just eating the shrimp and leaving the bread  and  fries. Very disappointed. My b/f said his gyro was \just okay\"""". It had pieces of chicken, turkey bacon,  and  beef in it. Not your traditional gyro. His fries, too, were soggy and cold. Thank God we had a Groupon because if we had to pay $25.00 for 2 sandwiches  and  2 iced teas that we did not enjoy at all, I would have been totally irritated. Would have given a 1 star but the waiter was nice. So giving an extra star and making it a 2."""""""

<review>Stopped by today. They were having a cheerleading fundraiser for a local high school. We waited 40 minutes for our food. My lemonade was not refilled the entire time. Food is set down. Right away I can tell my wife's avacado on her salad had been sitting out for quite some time. It is browned. Everything on my plate, a regular slam, is cold. I left, no charge. Upset enough to drive to ihop 6 miles away. 2 out of 10, would not eat here again. To be fair I believe it was the waitress' fault and not the kitchen.
</review>
<review>Great pizza but service was well below average. With only two other tables active in the restaurant, you would think that the service would have been much better. Seemed like we were inconveniencing the staff by being there. We arrived at about 2:30 and waited to be seated for about 5 minutes before being taken to our table. We sat there for another 10 minutes before our order was taken. We received our drinks soon after and wouldn't se a refill until after our food was completely gone and the bus boy had taken all of our dishes away. At that point, the server asked if we wanted desert and mumbled something about padding his tip before dropping the bill off. \n\nThis was my first experience at this restaurant and I have to say that it didn't live up to the expectations. For the money, $30 for a pizza three drinks and tip, I could have had much better service and equally as good pizza at NYPD or Bell Italia. You will not find me visiting this restaurant in the near future.

<review>I tried XO Nails because it was so close to my house, but the disgustingly dirty floors should have been my first indication that it wouldn't be the best manicure I'd ever recieve.\n\nI asked for the gel nails and they barely cleaned up my cuticles and used the same tools they used on a client before me. They were extremely sloppy with the polish and didn't clean up the excess gel surrounding my nails. This is a pet peeve, especially with gels because of how it dries. Three days later, the polish is already peeling off...unlike other salons I've been to where my gels stay on for 2-3 weeks.\n\nNeedless to say, I'm never going back.

<review>"""The previous statement was made by my wife and we don't feel the same way after the change in property management... Now that greystar is no long managing the property things have gone down fast. This property has definitely gone from an \A\"""" rating, to a \""""B\"""" rating. None of the security doors work in our building (we live in the high building of the property) and the gate for the parking garage hasn't worked for weeks. Our washing machine has been leaking for about a month now. The staff has stopped answering the office phones. Everyone we talk to that has lived here through the management change is moving out, including us. The funniest part is the staff is so incompetent that they set our lease buy out price at $0, so we can leave for free. So after our 60 days we're gone... It was nice for the previous two years, but everything has to come to an end."""""""

<review>"""Absolutely disappointed.  When your primary product is pizza and your menu is fairly limited you need to work hard to set yourself apart the crowd.  Unfortunately for me, Grimaldis fell flat on its face from an experience standpoint.  While my previous experiences have been average my latest encounter left me regretting my choice.  This evening I ordered a pizza to-go which you would think would be a simple uneventful task.  Not so.  My son and I stood waiting for 5 minutes before someone even offered to help us without any other customers waiting ahead of us.  Then we watched as the manager proceeded to pull each of the two girls who were handling take out orders away from their job to discuss some errors that had apparently occurred during their shift.  Mind you, this is in the midst of a Sunday night take out rush.  After the second girl got her \talking to\"""" I watched as she tried to compose herself (unsuccessfully) and then proceeded to remove her apron and walk out the door.  That left one poor girl to tend the phones and handle the to-go traffic since the Manager conveniently decided to disappear to the back of the house after her \""""talks\"""" with the to-go staff.  The remaining girl jumped between calls while to-go orders piled up below her counter.  I had a sneaking suspicion that one of those pizzas was mine, since I had now been waiting over 25 minutes, but I had no chance to ask about it because nobody was around to ask and the one counter girl was jumping from call to call.  After waiting another 15-20 minutes the girl started checking the pizzas and, just as I had assumed, brought me mine from the pile.  When I told her that I knew that this pizza had already been sitting there for 20 minutes she apologized and offered the lame excuse that it was very busy tonight.   \nI have at least 5-10 other pizza places I pass on my way to this place and Grimaldis just gave me an excuse to either try the others again or give them a first try before I return to this place."""""""

<review>My comments have nothing to do with this dealership's new-car service; instead, I'm going to vent a little about what happened when I visited both the Parts and Service departments at Superstition Springs Chrysler Jeep this morning. I went to the parts counter first, looking for a simple plastic trim fastener used for reattaching the door panel on my Jeep. You can buy a 50-piece bag of these plastic fasteners on Amazon for $9.95, but I wanted to finish the job I'd started now and didn't want to wait on Amazon. The parts guy looks it up on his computer, and with a straight face tells me that just one of these fasteners is $7.50! No way, I thought, so on my way out I stopped by the service counter to ask for the cost of a coolant flush. The service guy looks it up and comes back with $149.00  -- $50 more than either of the other nearby Jeep dealerships. So here's my take on Superstition Springs Chrysler Jeep: if you need parts or non-warranty service, stay away from this place. Just my 2 cents, of course, but it looks to me like these guys will hose you big-time on parts and service.

<review>"""I could no longer resist this goofy, red and white striped, old-fashioned sandwich shop. When the craving for a good sandwich kicked in, I decided to give it a shot.\n\nAs soon as you enter, you are assaulted visually with orange-red (well, I think that's what they are, underneath) walls, jam-packed with old signs, toys, and bumper stickers. Mind you, this is in a very small space. The tables are the old school laminate booths, decorated with some very 80's photos of teens. Lots of big hair!\n\nTrying to be somewhat calorie conscious, we ordered two \mini\"""" 5\"""" subs and some drinks. Each also came with a rather sweet potato salad or something similar. \n\nMy chicken sub was pretty dry and boring, and served on an equally dry and flavorless white roll. The only flavor it had was the occasional pocket of black pepper.\n\nAll in all, the food got a big *meh*. The decor was cool, but not worth eating the food. Oh, and if you decide to go, bring cash, rather than deal with their bizarre ATM system."""""""

<review>I don't know what to say.  2 fish burritos and a coke for 13 bucks.  the burritos were big.  if there are two of you just get one and split.  The fish was deep fried which sucked.  I don't know if you can ask for grilled.  They don't ask.  I don't eat beef so that kind of limits me.  the beef could be awesome and chicken great.  Better than taco bell, but i would have to go back and try it again for a solid grade.  but if you are hungry and you will eat anything they seem to have a lot of specials.

<review>"""Go find a dictionary. Look up the word \Meh\"""". Right next to it you will see a picture of Five Guys Burgers and Fries. \n\nI went to Five Guys with an open mind, having heard some good things about it from various friends and family. I walk in and am immediately bombarded with about 50 (maybe even more) signs with positive Five Guys reviews from various publications. \""""BEST BURGER IN PHILIDELPHIA!\"""", \""""HAMBURGER HEAVEN\"""", :\""""FIVE GUYS KNOWS FRIES\"""". Not only do I disagree with all of these reviews but I felt as if I was having these positive reviews shoved down my throat and if, god forbid, I felt differently than the reviews then I was some sort of freak. \n\nOn to the food. I ordered a \""""Little Bacon Cheeseburger\"""". It was 4.99. Apparently I am paying $1 for each one of the \""""Guys\"""" in \""""Five Guys\"""". I hope the appreciate it. For myself and the two others with me the meal total was $29.00. Yes, $29.00. I could have gone to Red Robin and probably paid less.\n\nWho cares about the expensive prices though, right? I mean, they give you free peanuts when you walk in. That makes everything better. There is nothing I want more with my burger than a box full of peanuts. \n\n/sarcasm\n\nBut yea, the burger didn't impress me. It was so sloppy. With every bite I lost about 1/4 of the toppings to the table. It wasn't a terrible burger, but it was by no means HAMBURGER HEAVEN. The fries were huge. We got the regular, not cajun, and they were as regular as can be. I liked that they were crispy, however they tasted a bit bland and had to be drowned in ketchup to salvage any taste. \n\nFive Guys does have hot dogs. I tried half of one to get an idea of how they were. It was pretty good. I liked it, although would not make a trip back just for a hot dog. The hot dog came in at 3.99, which compared to the burger is a steal. \n\nAbout the Five Guys vs In'n'Out argument. I didn't find it possible to compare to In'n'Out since one uses special sauce and the other uses conventional condiments like ketchup and mustard. If Five Guys used Thousand Island like In'n'Out, maybe we could compare, but they don't. When it comes to fries, though, In'n'Out has the edge in my opinion. \n\nSo basically I walked out of Five Guys with a much lighter wallet and a huge \""""meh\"""". If I ever want to take my future family out to try Five Guys, I better start a trust fund for them now so we can afford it."""""""

<review>"""Looking for a romantic dining experience with below average food?  Here it is.\n\nWe were excited to try this place because we'd heard about the patio seating overlooking a lake, romantic lighting, and even an outdoor fire pit.  \n\nBut as we were being seated, we noticed the restaurant was almost empty.  Not a good sign.  It took a while for a server to approach our table.  When we asked to see the prix fixe menu, he seemed annoyed.   We decided against ordering from the prix fixe menu anyway, because it was solely Irish food designed to commemorate St. Patrick's Day, even though we were there a week or so after the holiday.  It took another long while to actually place our food order.   I also asked for an ice tea refill, which never came.  This is not the kind of service you'd expect for a \fine dining\"""" experience.\n\nAs for the food, after our salad course, we were presented with a complimentary amuse bouche which was a little bit of olive oil, cheese, and a cherry tomato, served stylishly in a shot glass (see pic).  This seemed like a promising way to start our meal.  My husband had the filet and he said it was good.  I had the pork chop and it was awful.  Most of it was grizzled fat, and when I could find a pocket of lean meat, it was dry and flavorless.  I'm usually not one to complain, but the meat was so tough, I had difficulty cutting it, even with a big steak knife.  I should have returned it, but I didn't want to make a scene in such a beautiful environment.  I regret that decision.\n\nYes, the patio setting is lovely, but given the poor service and sub-standard food, we won't be returning"""""""

<review>This review is for the office at 5110 E. Warner Rd, Phoenix.\n\nI was told to arrive 30 minutes early for a 12pm appointment. I arrived at 11:37 for my son's 12pm appointment. I filled out the paperwork and began the wait. At 12:30, I approach the desk and politely ask if they can give me some sort of time estimate because I have to be at work at 2pm. The girl at the front desk then tells that the Dr is running 45 minutes behind schedule. She then tells me to hang on while she checks who is ahead of me, she proceeds to come back and tell me that there is still one person ahead of me. Again I ask for some sort of approximation of the wait and she tells me that the Dr will probably be able to see us between 1:15- 1:30. 90 minutes past my appointment time? Oh, yeah, that's totally acceptable, right? I think not. If I had come more than 5 minutes late for my appointment, I wouldn't be seen. It's cool though, you know, it's not like my time is worth anywhere near as much as Dr Chung's!

<review>Ew. Took the fam over here for dinner one evening. The sign said seat yourself. Okay there were plenty of tables open. But NOT ONE was clean.  A group of workers, including who we found out was the manager later, was sitting at the bar chattin it up. I had to pardon myself to be rude enough to interrupt their convo about justin bieber to please wipe down a table for us. Poor guy stands up slowly and wipes it down until its... uhhh... smeared with the ketchup from the prior visitor. thanks. so im already swallowing my complaints because my kids love those flippen hats. Thats when I see Mr. Cook with his gloves on by the rest of the group of workers eating his friends fries, then goes over to cook some poor customers food with those same gloves. Done. Kids, get your hats, we're outta here. We told the manager, same ketchup smearer kid, about how disappointing our experience was and what we saw. No thanks.
</review>
<review>This was incredibly disappointing.  I drive by this place almost every day on my way home from physical therapy, so when it was featured on Doozy of a Deal, I jumped at the chance to buy a coupon. \n\nMy husband and I came here after hiking in the McDowell Mountain preserve. I had the Mediterranean omelet with a pancake and he had the malted waffle with a side of home fries. My omelet was good, but the cooks foiled my attempt to make it healthy by cooking it in oil. I literally picked up the omelet and put it on a napkin, and the napkin soaked up its oil. Gross. My pancake was very dense and kind of dry. Not light and fluffy like pancakes should be. \n\nMy husband's waffle was pretty pathetic. Also dense and flavorless. Here's the scary part: the server dropped off the syrup and it was all frothy...we tasted it and we think it was fermenting. If they use real maple syrup and don't refrigerate it, then it will ferment. We had our server bring us another bottle and that one was better. \n\nOverall we will not be returning. We would both rather go to iHop than Over Easy.
</review>
<review>"""First, I'll start by saying that the food, once I was served, was good. Nowhere near worth the price. Certainly not worth the wait.\n\nThe only reason I came by here was that they have a sign proclaiming that they are mostly gluten-free. I walked in, the place is empty, and I waited quite a while before anyone bothered to come out and seat me, without a menu. Eventually the waitress brought me out pita bread with onions. I asked her if the pita bread was gluten-free and she told me of course it wasn't.\n\nNow, I figured this, however, if your restaurant is proud to be gluten free, and hangs a sign outside to encourage customers seeking gluten-free foods then a) you should ask first before you bring out (not counting desserts) the main item of food that ISN'T gluten-free out to your customer and b) don't be rude to your customer. Look, you just basically waved something delicious that I miss in front of me and in effect said \too bad you can't have this.\""""\n\nGetting past that, I was finally given a menu, and PLENTY of time to decide what I wanted. I ordered the Chicken Filet Sultani, which is chicken kabob with a ground meat koobideh kabob.\n\nThe koobideh was good, the chicken was kind of tough. Not dry, but maybe overdone. \n\nI then also had to wait for the waitress to come around for me to pay the bill. I just dropped cash and left.\n\nIf you are craving Persian food and you are in North Scottsdale, do not go to Pars. Get back onto Frank Lloyd Wright and drive west until you get to Scottsdale Road, then go north a little way and enjoy The Persian Room."""""""
</review>
<review>This place reminded me of something you would find along a truck stop driving cross country.  When I walked in, I expected a sports bar of course, but it wasn't a clean, cool, or well dressed scene.  \n\nThe food is okay, what do you expect from a sports bar?  Its pretty hard to mess up hamburgers and french fries.  \n\nI would expect it to be just a little bit nicer and cooler to attract a crowd that doesn't resemble a trailer park.  The one on via-de-ventura is a lot better and cleaner.

<review>Went here for lunch with 6 work buddies, it was not that busy. The service was very slow, one they took our order the lady didn't come back to check on us or fill our drinks until the food came. After that no refills again. Very Crappy service. I ordered a beef burrito, it had hardly any meat and was stuffed with mostly lettuce. For this place being around for 20+ years, you would think they would have good food. This was not the case. \n\nDon't waste your money or time..

<review>I decided to branch out and try a new Korean place.  I wanted to see how good/bad my usual place (Cho Dang) was.  I wasn't surprised to find out that Cho Dang is in a league of its own when it comes to Korean BBQ in CHandler.  Takamatsu was as underwhelming as it gets.\n\nThe decor is like a cafeteria.  Patrons are very loud.  It seems that everyone goes there for the all you can eat sushi.  The person who sat us thought we were there for it and our server did a triple take when we didn't have anything filled out on the sushi form.  Call me a sushi snob all you want, but I don't go to a Korean place to get my fix, and if I did, I wouldn't go to an all you can eat place.  I'm not trying to maximize calories, I am trying to maximize flavor.\n\nWe ordered two dishes we routinely get at Cho Dang, Bulgogi and another dish. we had some miso soup that was included which was good.  That is literally impossible to screw up because it comes from either a powder or a cube.  No points for not screwing that up.  \n\nOut came the sides and the dishes.  This is when it got very disappointing.  The sides were inedible.  Most were very bland while others were just bad.  I don't think any side was edible.  The bulgogi was decent, but still not as good as I'm used to.  The other dish was poorly executed and just tasted bad.  \n\nOverall, the place was really bad.  They deserve 1 star but if I could I would be generous and give them a 1.5 stars because we ate the bulgogi and didn't leave completely unsatisfied.  I'll never go back considering there is Korean food that is in a different league just down the street on Ray and Arizona.  \n\nThis place looked like a chinese buffet, and the food execution was on the same level.  I didn't see a single Korean there eating which is a bad sign.  I saw a ton of wannabe sushi eaters, a few SE-Asians and several old people. \n\nI gave it a shot once and won't be back.  Worst Korean food I've ever eaten without question.  Yelp reviewers are really starting to get a bad rap with me.  If this is the best Korean BBQ you have had, what places could possibly be worse?
</review>
<review>Horrible, horrible, horrible, service. Our waitress didn't do anything. Another waitress took down and brought our drinks, took our order and a different waiter brought us our food. If it had been busy , I wouldn't be so harsh. It was DEAD. Our actually waitress stood at the bar (right in front of us) and talked to the bartender. When we complained about our meal to her, she responded basically telling us it's not her job to prepare the food. At the end of our meal she was more than happy to bring us our check and not even ask if we needed anything else. I've been recommending to all my friends to go up the street to RnR - what a disappointment.

<review>I wanted to like Bison Witches.  \n\nUnfortunately, the best thing Bison Witches has going for it is its clever name. \n\nLet's start with the high points.  The sandwiches are large--the half sandwich is easily what you'd make for yourself at home and would call a sandwich.  The menu has a pretty large selection of sandwiches, and there are some other options, like soup and some appetizers.  There's a fair bit of outdoor seating to enjoy the gorgeous spring weather.  And, if you like beer, they've got a pretty good selection, even sporting a Hoegaarden on tap (a personal favorite).  They have some pretty decent happy hour specials... as such, if you're looking to waste away an afternoon hanging out with your friends, chatting over a few beers, and enjoying the day, you could do worse (especially being near Mill Ave.)\n\nThe place is really more bar than sandwich shop--the inside is a rectangular space lined with booths, with a a square bar in the middle surrounded by free-standing tables.  A couple of TVs strewn around the bar is a nod to a sports-bar environment, though I wouldn't ever visit with the real intention of watching a game.  As for the booth we sat in, it was broken, and I spent a fair bit of my time moving the seat back in place and wondering if it would tip it over.   \n\nAs renowned as the sandwiches are, I was disappointed to find them to be all bread.  The bread is fairly enjoyable, actually, as it's fresh and the slices are sizable and toasted.  But when they pair it with the rest of the sandwich, it's really not much to write home about.  I didn't feel any desire to try another sandwich after sampling the beef  and  brie on wheat--a little too sweet, too much bread.  My friend was none-to-impressed with her club, an easy sandwich that should please all comers.  The service was mediocre at best, perhaps bordering on curt a couple times, but I did appreciate their leaving us to be and drink for some time after we finished eating.\n  \nYou could do worse with your time and money, but you could certainly do better.  I wouldn't make plans to go to Bison Witches again, but I might go there again if pressed.  Certainly I'd be happy to sit there and throw back a couple Hoegaardens with friends and not worry about all the stuff I should really be doing...

<review>I've tried Golden Egg Roll twice. Once for delivery and once in the restaurant. BLECH! Both times. Actually ICK the first time, MEH slash ICK the second time. The delivery is quick and efficient. I ordered the House Fried Rice and a veggie egg fu young. I was grossed out by the shrimp in the fried rice. I could SMELL my shrimp before it even entered my mouth. Sounds normal right? No it was FUNKY shrimp that was slightly slimy. Blech. My Fu Young was unremarkable after you got past the saltiness of the dish. \nMonths later, I was asked by a coworker to have lunch. I let her pick the place... I will never make that mistake again. She picked Golden Egg Roll. The restaurant itself is nice and clean from what I saw. I chose the orange chicken. Again with the salt! I was baffled and I asked the other ladies I was with if they were having the same issue. Yes, they were! Well that summed it up for me. \nI probably won't visit Golden Egg Roll again. What a bummer, they have all this swag from a service (they probably paid for) naming them one of the top Chinese restaurants in the area. I'm uninterested in giving this joint another shot, unfortunately. There are too many other places to try.

<review>Let's just say...they make this place look really good in pictures on their website.  My husband  and  I stayed there last week while we were in town for spring training.  We were very disappointed when we drove up.  The hotel looked really, really old.  The website says recently remodeled but I think they forgot to update our room.  The carpet had stains on it and the fixtures in the room looked 20 years old.  The bathroom walls really need a good paint job.  \n\nThe people at the front desk were very nice.  When we first got there our room wasn't ready and they asked us to come back at 4.  We came back at 4:30 and the room still wasn't available.  They offered to hold our bags so we could get out to the baseball game.
</review>
<review>I went to this place mid week late afternoon( No other customers beside myself and my friend) We were not at all impressed by the service ie: the bartender(we sat at the Bar)He was young, attractive, with absolutley NO personality. We were unsure of what to order so we took our gamble on  the Jerk Burger, with a side salad. I must say the food was fair, the salad was yummy and refreshing. The glitch... right as we were served another employee decided it was time to freshen the air, and to disinfect the furniture. I would have to say ...The food was fair ..But they have a LONG way to go for customer service. Which by the way I have been in Rest/bar biz for 24 years. Sad but True

<review>I've been here probably three times over the course of several years. Each time I've gotten something different and it's been hit or miss in terms of how I've liked it. The last time was a week or so ago. Ordered a chicken dish which I don't see on the online menu. It was three stuffed chicken breasts and was a bit over $20 with no sides. Then we ordered pasta with marinara for an additional $9 or so and garlic bread for another $8ish. For the amount of food you get, the prices are a bit high. The chicken was really good, the pasta and garlic bread were very so-so. Not much different than I would expect at an Olive Garden or the like. Service was excellent and our waitress was very nice and helpful.

<review>I have two words for this bank: get TOE! (For those phonetically challenge, that is ghetto.) I don't bank here, but I have a credit card with them and needed to get the 411 on an issue I was having, so I thought I'd make a quick stop inside. The place seemed a little disheveled as I pulled in.  The parking lot was minuscule and the only open spaces had been hijacked by some really bad parking jobs. \n\nI walked inside and was greeted by the saddest looking bank interior I have ever seen. I think they were remodeling, but damn, it didn't even look like a bank. Even the people waiting in the long line looked depressed.  But, what do you expect when you have to entrust your money to such a lackadaisical place! I couldn't take the decrepitude, so I left. \n\nI know you shouldn't judge a book by its cover and maybe not even the inside pages either because the actual book could be really good, but I really hope they hurry up and do something with the place, or I'm gonna need to take some Xanax or Cymbalta before I venture inside again.

<review>"""How hilarious that two stars is \Meh\"""" because that famous phrase of Larry David's was how I was going to begin this review.\n\nThe giant pretzel? So so, probably microwaved. The menu is fairly pedestrian- why is it so hard to find German food other than wursts, schnitzels, saurbraten, and the occasional rouladen? Oh yeah, the smoked pork chops too- the kassler whatever. There's so much more to German food.\n\nFirst course was a soup not congruous with a German eatery. I don't remember exactly what it was, some cream soup that should have been called cream of milk.\n\nMy companion had a stew or goulash that was on offer that night. He liked it, but then again he's from St. Louis and thinks that Steak N Shake burgers are the shizzle.\n\nI had a sampler platter, don't remember what side dishes came with it, I believe they were generous and fairly tasty- not sublime, but tasty, albeit mostly forgettable. (If you read my other reviews you will note that I tend to remember everything I ordered and the subtle nuances thereof)\n\nI'd take a pass on Haus Murphy's, and that's sad, because they have a cute little biergarten and I like to support independent restaurateurs- a dying breed. \n\nSigh."""""""

Instead, you guessed it, overwhelming heat. It didn't say \""""Fra Diavolo\"""" so I think my expectations were in line. I really dislike restaurants that don't pay attention to the nuance of flavor.

<review>How disappointing my last visit here, and it was entirely attributed to the staff. These two girls (new since my last visit there) work there who have no concept of waiting on people, let alone running a business. They seemed more interested in chatting with their friends hanging out there then servicing customers. I sat there for ten minutes and neither of them bothered to even acknowledge me. What a shame that the good food and drink and nice ambience of the place has been ruined by an incompetent staff. It was like the place has been taken over by high schoolers. Too many other wine bars are out there that provide consistent customer service for me to bother returning to this place ever again.
</review>
<review>We had been hearing rave reviews about this pizza and yelp has the reviews to back up what we were hearing.  The staff is super friendly.  One of the best things about this pizza place is that when there is a line to be seated you can pre order your pie so when you sit down you wait for food is very short.  It is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out.\n\nOn to the food.  Started with the 1/2 and 1/2 dinner salad.  The Italian dressing was just ok for me, but there was nothing wrong with it.  The 1/2 of spinach was non existent.  The pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed.  My biggest complaint about the pie was the sweet sauce.  So sweet in fact that I had to add salt to try to cut the sweetness.  Defiantly not my favorite pie.
</review>
<review>Delux serves an OK  burger. For the price you pay, I've had much better. Just go to In N Out for your burger fix. It's better and cheaper. I'm not sure where people say this burger is phenomenal. Anything usually tastes good with a lot of butter/oil and bacon, which are one of two main ingredients of the Delux Burger after the beef. \n\nBut, other than that, the food here is marginal. The Chinese Chicken Salad was horrible (chicken wasn't cooked), fish sandwich was bland, and the grilled chicken sandwich was less tasty than McDonald's McGrilled Chicken.  \n\nThey have a decent selection of beers; however, the waitresses were slow with drinks and water. I would go to Four Peaks any day as the food is better and the drinks are cheaper. For burgers, save your money and go to In N Out. Although, Chelsea's Kitchen has a pretty decent burger (pricey as Delux though)\n\nI think people in Phoenix haven't had good food before, don't know what good food it, or clueless. Still not sure why people rave about these burgers.
</review>
<review>"""USED TO be known by locals for great wings and bartenders with some personality, but they ditched them for room temperature (not served hot to us at least), breaded food service (tasted that way) wings. Fresh made potato chips were not crisp, victims of undercooking, heat lamps, or steam evidently. To the chefs credit they are trying to leverage local by buying at the public market, but poor preparation and presentation, can't be overcome by \Local\"""" sourcing.\n\nThe other issue is that many nights the bartender is forced to run for food, leaving the bar unattended for long periods of time - a turn off to customers wanting service and for those just arriving, a signal to change their mind and leave.\n\nAlso, they should think about hiring some staff that can be found there every night like clock work - get some with personalities (anyone can make a drink, not anyone can host a hotel lobby bar). Many traveler don't just want to drink and watch some crappy basketball game, they would like some conversation which creates the chance to interact with other travelers - kinda like facebook, but with real live people."""""""

<review>This place is a JOKE!!!  If I were Michael Mina, I would pack my bags and go home quietly.  Then again, he's the one laughing all the way to the bank while serving up french fries and corn dogs.  Sacre bleu!!!\n\nThis place is great for assisting the Snottsdale crowd and other unsophisticated palates at overextending their revolving credit a bit further but if you want good food then go elsewhere.  More expensive doesn't always mean better quality.  Sometimes it means you're just getting screwed without the benefit of Astroglide.\n\nArtificially elegant setting with a provincial crowd and maybe fine for a HALF bottle of champagne but I say forget it altogether.  Zinc Bistro is more fun for people watching while sipping your bottle of Krug and chompin' on yer mac n cheese hoss.  Want a good meal?  Go to Houston's.

<review>I was looking forward for a good BBQ joint to set up shop in Tempe again since Big City BBQ got big time, moved out of their modest spot at Baseline and Rural and moved to Mesa.  Unfortunately, I just didn't feel the love for this place.\n\nI went for lunch and got the lunch special which was a pulled pork sandwich with a small portion of baked beans and a drink (can of soda) for $10.  There are no other drink options besides a few sodas.  That is a quite steep for an average BBQ sandwich.  The meat was juicy, but not super flavorful.  The BBQ sauce they have is decent and helped flavor it up a bit.  \n\nThe sandwich was large and I left full but with so much great food in Tempe and a few other good BBQ joints around town I probably won't stumble into this place again.  \n\n2 stars is appropriate... meh.

<review>I'm not going to do the whole....I'm from New York so I know pizza schtick here. (I have eaten many subpar slices of pizza and bagels in NYC so really don't trust what you New Yorkers have to say.)  Anyway, I found the crust to be soggy and limp and the edges to be very doughy. Decent flavor but if you don't have a good crust holding it all together, what's the point?\n\nThe garlic knots had a weird aftertaste, almost like they brushed clam juice over them.
</review>
<review>This place was absolutely disgusting. I read the reviews thinking it might be worth checking out.  The chicken in my chimichanga was very fatty and had very little flavor. My wife's enchiladas were also disgusting they had some weird cheese that looked and tasted like shredded string cheese. The salsa wasn't too bad but the chips were hard and cold. \n\nThere was only one waitress for the entire restaurant which was very disappointing because we had to wait for a good amount of time to order our food and to get our check.\n\nOverall, I will never ever go back or recommended it to anyone. We only ate several bites of our food and had to go somewhere else because the food was too disgusting to eat.
</review>
<review>"""I find LGO to be a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde type of place, so I will give a review with equal parts duality. In the end though, I'm going to go against the overwhelming positive grain and give it two stars for reasons below. \n\nThe Food\n\nMr. Hyde Says - This place seems to be two different types of restaurants. There's the breakfast/brunch servings and then there's the alternate menu, which consists of salads and their eponymous pizzas. For what it's worth, I've been here many times, more than I cared to, but my girlfriend used to live within walking distance, so it was too convenient to counter with any convincing argument against going. Of the many visits for breakfast, I've just felt underwhelmed by the food. The egg dishes, crepes, etc always leave me feeling unsatisfied and find they lack a bit of punch in the flavor department. For what it's worth, they're going for a French flare to the cuisine, but it still always seems to under deliver. \n\nDr. Jekyll Says - On the contrary, the non-breakfast foods are quite good. The salads and the pizzas are really good, freshly made and what you would expect from an \artisanal\"""" pizza place. Additionally, they have a solid beer and wine list. \n\nThe Brick And Mortar\n\nMr. Hyde Says - This place, specifically during the breakfast hours, is a disaster and would make any Retail Operations manager cringe at the lack of flow before them. You line up at one station to order food and pay. You line up at another station to order coffee and pay. There's no table service. You have to order your food, all the while, scout for the random table opening, while also keeping a watchful eye out for your food to make sure you claim it before it goes cold. And, to top it off, this entire place also operates as what most people think is a really cute market, full of curios that other people call junk. Mr. Hyde believes that this market only adds to the utter chaos and lack of flow for the restaurant. It would be different if it was off to the side, but smack in the middle of everything yields chaos. \n\nDr. Jekyll Says - Avoid breakfast and go for dinner, where you can have great salads, pizzas and actually be seated at a table by a hostess and served by a waiter. What a revelation. The dinner area is actually in a different room and you can avoid the really cute market.\n\nThe Getting There\n\nMr. Hyde Says - The parking, or rather lack there of, is a huge negative. There is minimal parking on premises, minimal parking across the street, with most of the neighboring businesses posting signs, threatening to tow you. \n\nDr. Jekyll Says - Let's call this place what it is - a nice neighborhood restaurant that can prove \""""convenient\"""" if you live nearby and can walk, avoiding the hassle and frustration that awaits you when you have to drive there. \n\nSummary\nIn the end, it's really four stars for the pizza, two for the breakfast foods, but they get dinged an extra star for the headache that is parking. \n\nMany Phoenicians love this place. I (we) think you can do better elsewhere. \n\nAuthor's Note: My girlfriend has now moved from this neighborhood, so any argument in her favor for a visit based on proximity is now moot. Mr. Hyde has cracked a menacing smile."""""""
</review>
<review>First: This is the tallest restaurant I've ever been to.\n\nSecond: They give pretty generous servings of beer in ironically tall glasses. Their wines are pretty good too.\n\nThird: Mr. Biersch's brewery and eatery, when it comes down to it, is really just a fancy version of BJ's minus the flatscreens projecting the latest sports event. The food isn't that great. Most American food restaurants fit within the nexus of the TGIFriday's scale: a fancy version of TGIFriday's being the best, Normal TGIFriday's being just TGIFriday's, and Poor Man's TGIFriday's being something like Denny's. This spot falls into the fancier version of TGIFriday's. You get the picture. I ordered a veggie pizza which literally was a thin-crust pizza that someone dumped a bowl of spinach on top after it came out of the oven. It's how a jock understands vegetarian eating.\n\nFourth: The staff is really friendly, but ultimately really busy because they're understaffed. It's probably related to our nation's clusterfuck to the poor house, but I think it's a restaurant's job to make sure that the customers are seen to.\n\nFifth: Their food is overpriced for what it is.\n\nSixth: This place isn't that bad, it just has no soul. It is what it is. You go for a burger, you go to drink, or you go to watch a game. Maybe a combination of all three.\n\nSeventh: If you're a diehard about this place, at some point in your dining life your idea of class was probably something along the lines of drinking champagne in Hooters.

<review>Our trip to Eddie's House was messed up because the cook couldn't cook the large pork chop well done.  My wife sent it back.  They cooked it more and it still came out pink in the middle.  What a shame, because it looked really good.  But my wife won't eat any pink meat.  She did really like the side that came with it, which is good because she never did get to eat the pork chop. The manager took the cost of the dish off our bill.\n\nMy scallops were very good, but the half order was only two large scollaps.  The salad was good, but unusual.  Sorry I can't recall the name of it.\n\nThe chocolate cake was very good too.\n\nOur waiter was very nice, and always on top of whatever we needed.\n\nWe over heard two other groups of customers complaining their burgers weren't cooked to order.  I think they should give the cook a meat thermometer for Christmas.  No, better yet, get it for him today for the sake of tonights customers.\n\nThe decor was nice.  I did feel the tables were too close together.  We had a hard time getting between the other tables to get to ours.  And we were so close to the next table that their conversation dominated our space.\n\nWith all the great restaurants in town I'm not sure if we will go back to Eddie's.  Too bad, because we were a fan of Eddie's previous restaurants.

<review>I stopped into Meineke yesterday because my battery was obviously about to die. Now, I should start by saying I used to live right by this Meineke and in the past they have always done a great job at a fair price. Yesterday however, they told me that my battery was bad, and I needed to take it back to wherever it had been installed as it was still under warranty. I had had it installed THERE, a few years earlier, but for some reason they had no record of it. I was told that without proof of this, it would be over $230 for a new battery installation. I don't know a lot about cars but I DO know that is insanely high for a new battery for my 2002 Toyota. I took it over to Fletcher Tires and they got me a new battery in 15 minutes for $90 and they were absolutely as nice as could be. I was hesitant to write this review as I have had good service in the past. However the attitude the one gentleman had and the huge price difference really rubbed me the wrong way, so consider yourselves warned!
</review>
<review>For all of the hype that this place gets, I was extremely disappointed in the food, the service, and the price. The food was probably the least disappointing of the three, as it felt a bit more authentic than your typical Mexican food chain. I will admit that I didn't try any of their well-known hatch chilies. For the price, this food didn't make par.\n\nThe service was awful. We were visited at most twice by our waiter, once for our order and once for the check.
</review>
<review>Old school fine Italian, with mob classics playing on a loop. Dated decor adds to the offbeat ambience. We tried seafood, veal, and two chicken dishes. The veal was lack luster, very thin mushy slices. The chicken dishes were tasty, one was Chicken Marsala the other a Chicken dish with artichokes. Sides were included in the price. The salad was great. Desserts were pretty good, the favorite was the cannelloni. The house red wine was good and generously poured. We wanted to like this family restaurant, but we won't be back.
</review>
<review>"""Service and ambiance were typical for a friendly, mainstream Mexican / American restaurant.  No complaints there.  Our server was quick with refills and made sure we were taken care of.  The restaurant itself was festively decorated and clean.\n\nThe food, however, was below par when compared to similar competition, being On the Border, Serrano's or Macayo's.  And we felt that pretty much across the menu they were also $1-$2 more per item.  But the big kicker....There just wasn't any flavor!  The food came quickly, as it usually seems to do in this style of dining establishment.  My wife and I ordered the \Holiday Special\"""" burrito, made with beef and two kinds of chili sauce.  I made it through two bites and was so unimpressed I just stopped eating.  I also added an a la carte beef taco to my burrito...at a cost of $4.99.  There was no flavor coming from that shredded beef that would've given me a hint I was eating southwestern food.\n\nI don't expect much from a $5 kids meal, so I'll give that those were okay, Kraft mac and cheese for one and a burger and fries for the other.\n\nI'm not going to write Arriba's off our future nights out.  Maybe we just got a bad batch of coming out from the kitchen that night.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing and should have asked for a recommendation.  In any case we'll give them another shot."""""""

<review>Ordered a bouquet for my mom for Vday and it was pitiful.  Called the shop and actually spoke to the owner.  She wouldnt do anything to help, said it's not about how much the bouquet is but what each individual flower costs (thats why there barely were any), lied about being BBB accredited and yelled at me to just file a complaint with them and hung up on me.  I did file with the BBB and if youre smart you'll check the BBB website.  She is not accredited with them and has an F rating. She also never responds to complaints even through the BBB much less if your just an individual contacting her.  My mother also said that she had the exact same issue with this florist.  Never using them again and going OUT OF MY WAY to warn everyone I can not to use them either.

<review>There was only one item that I would come here for once in a blue moon and that was their 99\u00a2 double stack. I am not a frequent fast food connoisseur and don't eat it on the regular but the double stack was one of the only exceptions I would make every so often. Well they have taken it off their value menu and raised it to $1.79 and officially made it easy for me to never step foot in a Wendys again. It's just not that good to pay any more for.  They also reduced the nuggets to 4 pieces instead of 5.  And they increased the price of their small chili to $1.49.  I will miss your value meals and dollar double stack and your beautiful red pigtails Wendy. RIP Dave Thomas.

<review>My family insists on going to this Chipotle because they like the food.  I go next door to AJ's and buy my food because I would never eat in a place this FILTHY!  Every time I go, same thing.  I complained to management and they don't seem to care.  Doesn't matter what time we go - busy or not, tables are never cleaned, floor has food all over it.  And the bathroom?  Ugh - I won't even go there.  The health dept really needs to pay this place a visit!

<review>This night at Red Lobster was the worst. We came here on a Saturday night. We had to wait but, not a problem at all. You expect that on a busy night. The place is under construction and that is not good to keep it open while that is going on. It actually smelled like chemicals and building materials. The worst part about this night was our waiter Bob. He had no interest in doing a good job that night or in making any money apparently. We had the worst possible service that you could imagine. Old and cold coffee, wrong drinks and ,he even put the wrong number on our order. So that when someone else brought out our food they could not find us.  The cheese biscuts are not what they used to be, All fake ingredients in my book. Not happy at all with our experiance here, I absolutly will say we will never be back.
</review>
<review>I like the products offered at Sports Chalet and have shopped here since they opened this location a couple of years ago. The service on the other hand leaves much to be desired. I know there is a recession and retailers are still operating at times with short staffs, but maybe if you had some workers, you would sell a product or two. I stopped by Sports Chalet today at lunch and made 8 to 9 laps around the store looking for a couple of products. No workers approached me to ask if I needed help or wanted to see anything - in fact no workers in site except for the two ladies at the front counter. A couple of loops through the shoe department and I found what could have been what I was looking for, but on further inspection, it wasn't. Finally someone approached and asked if I was finding everything or had questions. I was looking for the pouch that can hold the Nike Plus chip on a shoelace for non-Nike shoes. What I had in my hand was a mini wallet that would hold your key and maybe an ID. I asked the worker if that was the product I was looking for - clearly not knowing what he was selling he said yes, that's what I needed. I never did find the other things I was looking for or the correct product. I put it down and found what I needed at RoadRunner.\n\nSports Chalet isn't bad if you know what you are looking for and can find it yourself - but don't expect help from the sales staff. Any knowledgeable help anyway.
</review>
<review>"""I'm guessing this place isn't that old and could get better with time. The equipment, furniture and menus all looked pretty new; and the staff, while very friendly, seemed a little slow in their processes. It seemed they just didn't have enough experience yet to handle the rush (and after rush) that they said they had just gone through prior to my arrival. \n\nWhen I realized how slow the kitchen was running I changed my order to \to go\"""" and got ready to leave. I'm not sure what my experience would have been had I stayed, but what I took with me was very disappointing (and I only traveled about two blocks by car before I opened the bag). \n\nI had ordered the combo of a Chicago dog, soda and natural fries. I noticed as my dog was being assembled that they sprayed the top of the bun with a little water mist to allow the poppy seeds to stick and I had a sinking feeling right there. The baskets of crinkle-cut fries that were coming out of the kitchen looked good, so I thought at least I had that to look forward to.\n\nHowever, as I suspected, a bun that is sprayed with water and then immediately wrapped in foil is not a happy camper and neither was I. In their menu they mention how the \""""natural casing\"""" (otherwise known as intestine) will snap when bitten into (implying quality, I guess), but mine was chewy. And my natural-cut fries were less than half the portion I saw everyone else getting, undercooked and soggy (from what I could see, they didn't use the classic technique to make fresh-cut fries crispy). Unfortunately, the best part of my meal was the Dr. Pepper.\n\nAnd to top it off, my meal cost $9, including a small tip. WAY too much for what I got.\n\nSo, friendly (and apologetic) people, not-so-good food. I might try it again, but I would give them six months or more to get their act together."""""""

<review>Dropped in here to pick up a few items during the Christmas shopping period. It was tough because they had a new guy working and he didn't know how to use the computer real well so checkout took forever. I normally wouldn't hold that against an establishment, but it was how the supervisor handled it that I'm giving them 2 Stars. Instead of helping the guy through the entire process, he would only help a little and then leave him alone, which made the process agonizingly slow. \n\nI could understand if he was doing this to assist other customers, but he wasn't. He was flirting with the other 2 girls who worked there...talking about whether they liked the new Samsung Galaxy or the iPhone 5...ridiculous. \n\nI felt really bad for the new guy. I hope it gets better for him. I bought what I needed and then bolted out of there. It took 20 min to get through my checkout....no exaggeration. \n\nReturn Factor - 30%
</review>
<review>We had a quick lunch as part of a business meeting and hoped to find a new choice for downtown.  The service was attentive as the restaurant was nearly empty (at 11:45 am), but our server knew next to nothing about the menu items.  He also seemed incapable of making eye contact, which was just odd.  The lentil soup was very good, though the portion was also very small.  I coupled that with a flat bread that was somewhat bland.  My guest had a chopped salad that she had to send back once.  When it came out again, it was fine, but nothing about it stood out.  All in all, it seems like your standard hotel restaurant--eat there if you're stuck in the building, but get out if you're not.

<review>"""I want to start out by saying that I read all of the really good reviews here. I think I may have just gotten an unhelpful person, but I'd like everyone to know what happened. I moved close enough to work that I'm able to bike it full time again, so I went to Rage (based on recommendations) to get a nice road bike. I liked the fact that they had a pretty good assortment of bikes outside as well as inside, and I had a chance to look around before I was greeted and asked if I needed help. I told the guy that I was sort of new to biking in the Valley, would be going down x road, and that I had (here's where it goes VERY south) 500$ to spend. At that point, he shook his head and told me that I should go to Tempe where they have a school program where they build bikes from recycled parts and that that would be in my price range. \nREALLY. \nHow condescending of you. There were bikes that were in the price range (I saw before he greeted me), he didn't even give any explanation such as, \Oh, a decent bike is $$$, let me show you why.\"""" Just acted like I am not good enough to be there, or apparently get a new bike and should buy a recycled one. (this program is actually really cool, on a side note)\nSo, I went to Kore, where they not only answered my questions, gave outstanding sercive, and *built* me a bike- and I've returned there for more supplies and services. \nI am very happy I didn't give this business my money with service like that."""""""

<review>I have eaten at other Pei Wei locations and have been satisfied.  However last nights purchase of four entrees was very disappointing.  The Dan Dan steak entree was so overcooked I think they mixed up our order with the nursing home order, you couldn't eve bite the noodles, they just mushed in your mouth.  The teriyaki chicken was also overcooked, totally dried out and without any sauce on the meat or veggies.  To top off the insult, only 2 fortune cookies came with our order of 4 entrees, is the economy so bad we are sharing fortune cookies now?

<review>I really loved my stay at The Clarendon Hotel this July and the Gallo Blanco cafe was convenient for breakfast but I ordered to take back to my room for myself and two guest. I had some sort of breakfast burrito which was pretty good but my guest ordered chorizo eggs and refried beans, which was all thrown into a brown take out box... It looked so unappealing. I mean to have to scrape refried beans from the bottom of a box... not cool! It really lacked presentation. However their yogurt with fruit was great as was the fruit con creama. I had higher expectations and perhaps maybe it was because of me ordering it to take to the room but they need to figure out a better way to serve beans. would I give them another chance... only to dine in =D

<review>"""At first look, this may seem like a hotel that you may compare with the Standard Hotels in Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles judging by their photos.  They even promote the fact that they won a four star review from Howard Seftel (who is a restaurant critic) for \Best of Phoenix\"""". Since I was going on this trip for work I didn't mind checking it out.  I mean why not sacrifice the points to stay at something on the up and up?  WRONG IDEA.\n\nFirst let me say that I should have researched this further but I was going off their site and some user reviews.  When I arrived to the hotel, it wasn't very noticeable.  It wasn't noticeable because it was on a quick one way street or hidden behind other structures, but rather more for the fact that it was in the middle of a neighborhood surrounded by apartment complexes.  The exterior of the business didn't look very impressive.  It looked like a poor girl who was trying too hard to be noticed by wearing trendy clothes that don't look right on her.  This motel make-over covered its old self as well as the best concealer on an acne ridden 13 year old.\n\nThere was music playing through out the hotel, and I did take notice of their strong consistency of marketing to a select demographic (ie. young, urban, chic 20-early 30s).  When I stepped into my room I was glad to see that the pictures spoke the truth on what to expect.  Everything in the room was new --- from furniture to carpet.  They had a wonderful bed, one of the most comfortable that I've slept on during my business travels.  The only thing that I have to complain about the room is:\n\n1. The air conditioner didn't work or I didn't know how to work it\n2. They have no pens in the hotel room, yet they have notepads\n3. The WiFi didn't work that great because the signal was too weak and they didn't have a hard wire LAN line\n\nAs for  the restaurant that was located within the hotel, I didn't give it any chance.  There were only 2 people dining in there (even after I went out for an hour drive, the same people were there!) and it seemed so dead.  If I wanted to eat alone I would have eaten fast food or ordered a pizza.  I checked out their \""""24 hour fitness\"""" area and noticed that most of the cardio equipment was out of order (why even advertise it then?!?!?!).  There was nothing to do within walking distance of the hotel, unless you wanted to stand by a corner and wait to score a dime sack or get a soda at the gas station.\n\nOverall, I can see the message that this hotel is trying to send but I think that they are in the wrong location.  They have a long way to go but I see a really, really long road ahead of them.\n\nFor their location (because location is everything), I must give them 2 stars.\n\nWill NOT see you there.\n\nSam"""""""

<review>I have friends that rave obout this place so I decided to try it. I think I made a mistake on ordering a salad from the VSC. Dont get me wrong, it was very fresh and tasted good. It was just a whole lotta lettuce and not so much toppings. I ordered the Cobb and there was maybe the equilivant of 2 pieces of meat, not sure if the bacon bits were fresh or packaged, about 1/4 of an avacado, and a tablespoon of blue cheese crumbles. The homemade crouton were good and the salad dressing was excellant. \n\nNow for a salad that cost over $7.00, that is just no right. Less lettuce and more protien would have been perfect. \n\nBut they were very friendly and the salad tasted good. Next time I will go with a sammich.
</review>
<review>This place is ok. Being from the south, I know what real soul food tastes like, and this is the commerical version of that. I have the opportunity to sample the chicken wings, mac and cheese, collards and yams. It was just ok. The mac and cheese was bland, the yams were decent. The fried chicken is hit or miss. Once my chicken was finger looking good; but then it tasted reheated.  The place is always packed with a diverse customer base; which is great. I would go back to eat; but its certaintly not a place that I drool over like I do Grandma's Sunday dinner.

<review>This was my first time at the Melting Pot for dinner, I have gone before for dessert and drinks at another location. We weren't able to get a reservation until 8:30 which was ok, but then we weren't seated until close to 9:00. They were offering a special, $30 for 3 courses. The first course, the cheese was really good. Then came our entree course. Our burner was going out which wasn't an issue during the cheese. But our meats and vegetables were taking close to 10 minutes to cook, when it should take 2-3. Our waitress was aware that it was taking longer and suggested that we move, but if anyone has been there, you know it's not that simple. The dessert was next and honestly it's the only reason I would go back. Based on my first full meal experience, I will not be returning to a Melting Pot.

<review>After being stood up by my studio photographer for the LAST time (a very angry yelp review is brewing in my head as I type this) I was getting dehydrated and gouchy as I haven't had a bite to eat all day. \n\nWe decided to go to La Olmeca for lunch. This place used to be one my auntie's favorites, so I chose to give it a go... We entered a booth filled resturant that seemed frozen in the 80s or worse - the early 90s. Wood paneled walls, grimy pastel booths and chipped wooden tables can be looked over when the food is good... but the food just wasn't.\n\nI had had the taco salad and was very disappointed. It was just meh. Taco Bell does a better jobat this lunch time favorite than these guys do. My mom got the cheese omlet special. She wasn't complaining, but I would be if I saw the brown underbelly of her overcooked omlet. Her potatos were straight from a bag. BUT the salsa was good. \n\nOverall... skip this place. Even if you're in the area... a couple blocks south and you'll be at Poncho's... trust me you'll be waaay better off! I don't think I'll ever go back.
</review>
<review>Overall totally average...Pizza and salad while using quality ingredients is boring and dare I say skimpy!  I mean I was seated at the counter once at lunch because the hostess said all the tables were reserved(at lunch?) well barely a quarter of the tables were occupied by the time I left..but I digress..so I am at the counter and this guy who is not wearing gloves and has extremely hairy arms and knuckles is kneading the dough and literally counting out the toppings he is placing on the pizza..Really gross..put on some gloves already. The people who make the salads wear gloves and they barely touch the food!  It is also very loud...in a I can't hear the other person kind of way.  So many better places but if you are curious try it and send in your review..I'll be @ Nello's or having Rosati's deliver
</review>
<review>If I could I'd give this ZERO stars.  I see the reviews are all for nails, but DO NOT go here for your hair.  Worst 3 1/2 hrs. of my life!  Appointment was at 10:30 and should have been out by noon; missed a 12:30 birthday luncheon but that was only the half of it.   Had to go through about four different processes to try to correct the horrible mess she made of my hair color.  Ended up putting my hand up, telling her just to stop, and walked out with wet hair, which was neon yellow and looked like Big Bird.  Besides being totally damaged.  If they offered, as she did, would YOU go back to a place like this and let them try to fix it?  I think not.  Had to live with that embarrassment for weeks before I could go to someone who knew what they were doing and get normal hair again.  Also, the place is filthy and has only one sink, so you sit and wait to be rinsed out until that chair opens up.  So you're sitting there with chemicals burning your head and overprocessing.  It's normal for gossip in a salon but these women talk loudly about very personal and inappropriate matters (including about other employees who aren't present), AND fight with their husbands on the phone in front of clients.  It was a total three ring circus!    \n\nThey claim they've been in business in that center for over 25 years and I can't imagine how.   The new guy I'm going to mentioned he knew the owner and I had to just bust out laughing and told him the story.  \n\nSave yourself a lot of money and GRIEF; trust me, this place is anything but devine!

<review>It's been a very long time since I visited Claim Jumper, so we were excited to head over on Saturday.  We left disappointed though, the food was par at best and the service was slightly below par.  We had an eclectic dinner for my mom's birthday, I had the Margareta pizza which was alright, but I've certainly had better.  My mom had the macadamia nut mahi mahi and it was alright, the grilled veggies were so soaked in better or oil that they were almost uneatable.  I'm of the belief that if you have quality produce you don't need to soak them in butter after grilling and before serving.  My husband had the whiskey apple glazed chicken which was actually the best of our dinners but not over the top delicious just alright.  Skinny ritas are not to be missed, hands down the best part of our meal, skip the lemon drop though.  Also just a note for the bartender, I had the first cosmo I'd had in a while (just sounded yummy) and it was full of tiny pieces of lime, like lime pulp it was terrible.  At $9 I shouldn't have to strain my own cocktail.  We also order a piece of the huge chocolate cake for dessert (to take home) after a few hours we split it up, it's all sugar and no chocolate it seems.  We honestly threw most of it away.\n\nPersonally our money would have been spent better elsewhere and that's where it will be spent next time.

<review>"""We keep giving this place a chance, but we always seem to head home disappointed. \n\nThe space is amazing, so we really want to love this spot!!  I feel like I could sit in the garden all day.  Then the food and \service\"""" come and we get slapped back to reality.  \n\nMy girlfriend is done attempting to get eggs that don't come out cold.  I mean, really, we may sit on the far end of the garden (our favorite spot) but it's not like we're down the street!  Cold watery eggs, even with the yummy fillings, are never a treat.  \n\nI've tried a little of everything, but I am a sandwich guy.  I used to argue in favor of the turkey, but on my last two visits it was lacking turkey and extra bacony.  I tried to go for the french toast instead, but it was just soggy and cold.  \n\nAll I end up asking is who's running the show?  I often feel bad for the service staff, because they generally look unhappy and frantic.  They frowns definitely transfer to the people around them.  This place should seriously look at having a normal service, because most of the time it just looks disorganized.  I've watched servers walk the garden 3 times to find the table they are looking for.  3 times!!  No wonder Sarah's eggs are always cold!\n\nWe gave it several shots because we kept hoping it was just growing pains.  Sadly, I cannot justify giving them more of my money to leave unhappy."""""""

<review>"""I used to like blue wasabi.\n\nAdmittedly, I liked other sushi places better.  Blue wasabi was more of a drinking place with decent sushi, and I don't mean decent like not indecent--I mean decent like eh, it was decent.\n\nthis place has the acoustics of a mess hall.  annoying. but what really annoyed me was this:\n\none time I was there with wife and in-laws, and because I have a ridiculously sensitive palate (at least when it comes to salt) I noticed right away that there was some foul shit happening with the soy sauce.  By foul shit, I mean that they were serving the low sodium version.  *pauses for ensuing outrage*\n\nNow they serve their soy sauce in little innocuous looking devices that don't come with the courtesy of a green or red lid.  What this means is that innocent people were unwittingly eating low sodium soy sauce.  Which is punishable by law, or divine retribution when \kingdom\"""" finally \""""comes.\""""  anyway....\n\nSo I ask for the manager, and say: \""""is this low sodium soy sauce?\"""" And he says: \""""Yes.\""""  And I say: \""""Can I please have some *real* soy sauce?\"""" And he says: \""""we don't serve anything but low sodium soy sauce.\""""\n\nOne fucking star, and be glad you got even that.

<review>When I first heard of this restaurant I was soooo excited especially due to the fact that that the owners father is a owner of a nello's pizza. So I thought this would be the younger modern fusion of pizza. I loved the location and decor of this restaurant it was very inviting and I loved the fact that they carried LUX coffee since that is some good coffee. The pizza is another story I really didn't feel they matched flavors well duck with citrus and and too many herb mixings on all the pizzas we got. we also found hair in one of the pizza's which I got really grossed out after that and I didn't want to continue eating anymore. Overall great decor/ambiance, music and coffee is great but I will not be back after the whole pizza incident.

<review>WOW WHAT A MESS!!! Got there after running 6 miles and really wanted some carbs and a BEER!! Our whole group was told the kitchen was closed? damn another bar with no kitchen? No the cook just had to help the bartender because obviously he hates his job and was one of the grouchiest men I've met will some one please get this guy the female attention he is lacking? I placed an order and he said oh yea I guess the kitchen is open so I'm the only knowing one to order two beers at one time since it takes him a hour to walk to where? to get the beer oh well the cook fried all the meaness out of my fish and chips and I ended up feeding the entire table off my plate and watching some lame game of sending a goldfish down a flume? Does this place ever get cleaned? I think not, ok i guess we're on a deserted island but this bartender was NOT the skipper.. skip this place.

<review>I have been to The Loving Hut 3 times now, and everytime I wonder why it is that i'm going back.  The food is far too overpriced for what it is. Today I called to ask what the lunch special was, and was informed that it was sushi, wonton harmony, and blissful friend rice.  Great, thats what a lunch special usualy includes...small orders of a few different items.  Nope, when i called back to order this special, i was told I was to choose one of the 3, not that i get all 3.  So I ordered the Blissful Fried Rice. When I went in to pick it up, it was ready and thats always a plus to not have to wait on an order that was called in 20 minutes prior.  I then ordered a Mumbai Spirit, or hot chai, and my total came to $10, and I left $1 tip.  When the cashier made my drink she poured a pre-made chai mix into a steaming pot, steamed it for a solid 4 seconds and poured it into what looked like it should be a childs cup, or water cup at any other place.  When she handed me the drink it felt like there was nothing in the cup but foam, and the paper it was made out of.  I opened it up to find that my childs size cup was only filled half way, and i asked her if I could have her fill the cup as I paid $3 for this drink. She told me thats how much you get if you eat in, therefor thats how much i get it if i take it to go.\n\nSo to round out my LAST experience at The Loving Hut, I paid $6 for a small container of rice with some bits of carrots, peas, tofu, and cilantro. I would say this order cost them a solid $0.75 to make, and my pre-made 3 1/2 sips of chai that was steamed to a foamy perfection, was maybe $0.40 because of the waste of paper cup.\n\n I REALLY wanted to be able to love this place and eat here often, as there are next to no vegetarian or vegan places around, but for the price I will happily go somewhere else like Mellow Mushroom, who have a few tofu, tempeh, and veggie items, and be able to pay the same prices for food that is delicous.
</review>
<review>I've since returned to this restaurant, and gotten a bad surprise. I ordered a dish on the new menu (a lot more options than before) that came with a short description in English and had a photo next to it. What arrived looked nothing like the photo or the description. I ordered the shrimp and crab noodle dish, which in the photo looked like it had hand-made noodles that resembled Korean potato dumplings. I got a pork and shrimp noodle soup with clear, thick noodles and had a lot of pork slices, chunks of pork blood and just two shrimp. When I pointed this out to the server, she said that they didn't have what was described on the menu and what I got was their substitute. But she neglected to tell me this when I ordered, even though it seemed she knew about the planned substitution because she wasn't even surprised when I brought up the differences. \n\nAt that point, I was so hungry that I just kept the dish, but if I had known what I would get, I would have ordered something else entirely. The restaurant gave me a 10% discount off my bill, which hardly made me feel better. What if I had dietary or religious reasons that prevented me from eating pork? \n\nThis is a real shame, because before this meal I liked the place and their food/service, and preferred eating there over all the other restaurants in the Mekong complex (which has a LOT of food options). I won't be returning here, and I suggest that anyone who goes here makes sure that what you order is actually what you will receive, because the server isn't going to tell you about any bait-and-switches.

<review>"""I live very close to this location of Julioberto's and I have eaten at this location several times. The food has always been fast and good. However my experience last night changed my opinion of the restaurant. I am solely basing my review on this experience. \n\nLast night I went through the drive-thru and when I came to the window, I noticed individual styrofoam cups sitting on top of the soda fountain. A few seconds later I saw an employee drinking out of a styrofoam cup. He took a few sips, and then poured out the rest of his cup into the soda fountain drain below the dispensers. That freaked me out a bit, but not as much as what happened next. \n\nHe then rinsed out his cup using the water dispenser on the fountain. He sloshed it around and then poured out the contents. The contents splashed all over the dispenser and into the ice maker that was just below the drain. He then placed his drinking cup on top of the dispenser with the rest of the styrofoam cups. Water was still dripping off the side of the cup and on to the fountain.  A second later another employee started filling my cup with ice from the same ice maker.  \n\nWhen I expressed disgust at what I had just observed, I was told, \It is okay.\""""  I am not sure that she understood what I was trying to tell her, because she was confused as to why I no longer wanted a soda. The lack of hygiene appalled me. I won't be back."""""""
</review>
<review>I had lunch here one afternoon when it was surprisingly not crowded. I am giving four stars for an always cozy atmosphere and a nice patio.\n\nI had the enchiladas which had a nice kick, especially the pork. But the quality if the food in relation to the price is what gets me. Everything is good but not great enough to warrant the prices. And the service is almost always lacking.\n\nThis particular time, we seemed to be the victim of our server going on break and their being a breakdown in communication or coordination. In any case, we had to  wait a while before our drinks were refilled and my salad was forgotten. Our server was nice and apologetic so no worries. Not always the case as some servers make it clear that they are way above looking after the likes of us.\n\nSo overall, not a bad place, the prices, quality and atttiude serve as enough of a deterrent to patronize again in the future.

<review>"""My travel girl and I spent last week in the Scottsdale area.  We met up with a couple of VA friends in AZ, and wound up at this place when we couldn't find our original restaurant choice.  What a mistake.  When we walked in the place wasn't very busy, but the staff looked like they didn't know which end was up.  We were \assisted\"""" by a server who didn't have a clue about what she was doing.  Among other things, we ordered a bottle of wine, which she promptly opened and poured four glasses, without any of us even testing it out.  Among the four of us, we ordered a few appetizers and a main dish each.  My drunken noodles came out before the appetizers!  I told the server to take it back and give us our appetizers first.  Very small portion of edamame and fairly tasteless spring rolls.  Our friends ordered a 'spicy spicy roll' and something else (forget the name).  Both dishes looked exactly the same, and the worst part was that it just looked like a blob of rolls with some sort of sauce dumped over the whole plate.  What a mess.  My drunken noodles were just o.k., and my girl's rainbow roll was pretty uncolorful.  Overall, 1.25 stars...can't understand how anybody could give this place four or five stars; you gotta be kidding, people!"""""""

<review>We are hungry, we do not want to go on an expedition. We want spicy, cheesy goodness. And a margarita. We decide to hit up Arriba's since they're just up the street, and per our usual chill demeanor, sidle up to the little bar to grab a margarita, and decide what spicy green chile dishes we want to eat. \n\nNow, I haven't been to this place in a couple years, and the last time I went, was driven there, half in the bag after watching a softball tournament. At that time, maybe I didn't care so much, maybe it was because I couldn't see the bartender making my drinks, I don't know....BUT\n\nIf you are a *new* bartender, don't upsell me a handmade margarita with Cuervo, instead of your house concoction that comes out of a tap,  use the small side of the jigger to pour said tequila into one of those ridiculous tiny cactus margarita glasses, haphazardly salted, expect me to pay $6 for tiny little glass and crappy pour, and somehow appreciate that you have any understanding of what it means to make a good margarita - you know, one where the orange from the triple sec lightly dances with the tequila flavors rising above the  sweet and sour and the tang of fresh lime juice - especially when you still haven't given me a menu, and are now serving jiggerless poured Crown and diets and Jack and diets to your 21 and a half-year old friends who are leaning all over the bar with slithering arrogance and no sense of personal space (yes, I can smell your drugstore perfume, and no, it doesn't make you pretty).\n\nSo, no, I don't want this crappy tiny margarita, and no, I don't even think I want to eat here. \n\nWe went to La Pinata instead, because that's what we should have done in the first place.

<review>"""This place is a fast foodish style Greek spot where you order at the counter and they bring you your food.\n\nThe restaurant itself is located on the very west end corner of the complex that houses the AMC Deer Valley 30 Movie Theater and was formerly a Souper Salad.

This seemed to carry into the restaurant a little bit too. Despite this problem, we proceeded to order and try out the place.\n\nI ordered up the Vegetarian combo that comes with a greek salad, hummus, tiropita (cheese pie), falalfel and pita bread. My girlfriend ordered a chicken plate that came with thinly sliced chicken pieces, \greek\"""" fries, rice and a salad. \n\nMy meal was pretty decent, everything was just \""""ok\"""". Nothing extraordinary or outstanding. My girlfriend didn't like the greek salad dressing, claiming that it tasted too \""""olivey\"""". She also didn't like the rice, which was pretty plain and didn't taste like lemon whatsoever. The \""""greek\"""" fries didn't seem very greek at all. They appeared to be non-house made fresh fries with a bit of seasoning on them. She said the chicken was OK.\n\nMid-way through our meal, the Greek music CD that they were playing in the restaurant started skipping. Now we all know how annoying a skipping CD is. It's basically an ear-wrenching, headache inducing nightmare. Not a big problem if they would've fixed it right away, but they let this POS audio-bomb go for at least 10 minutes before fixing it. C'mon guys, get your act together."""""""

<review>Do not go here unless you like to listen to a sales pitch and have the guy not listen to you when you tell him what you want.  I pulled up on a Saturday morning and there weren't many cars there. The one car that was in line pulled back out and left as did I after the guy wouldn't take no to his offers.  I went to Danny's and used my coupon.  No sales job, just got the car washed

<review>"""I have ordered Red Devil's pizza and wings for takeout for years now, but today was the first time I dined in the restaurant.  We started with the potato skins which were served slightly overcooked and without any sour cream, which Red Devil does not carry.  (Really? Who serves potato skins without sour cream).  For our entrees, I ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.  I only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that I could not bare another, and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a McDonald's burger and tasted like a \slightly better quality school lunch burger\"""".  These three items and one Pepsi cost us 32 dollars before tip.  All in all, we left hungry and forty dollars poorer.    We will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings."""""""
</review>
<review>"""This place was said to be \busy\"""", so I made sure to arrive before opening time at 11 AM, expecting a long line outside such as I would have found at Matt's or Five Guys.  Instead, there was no one else,  and  that was still the case at 11:05, when the door was still locked, the dining room dark,  and  the \""""Open\"""" sign in the window off.\n\nFiguring they had gone out of business, I started my car to drive away, but just then the \""""Open\"""" sign lighted (although the dining room remained unlighted during my visit).  I found a table with enough light to read the magazine I had brought along, but then loud music started playing, so I couldn't hear myself think anyway,  and  it played during my entire visit.\n\nThere were a variety of tacos offered,  and  a combo including two tacos plus rice  and  beans was priced ok at $6.99.  \""""Vanessa\"""" brought me a basket of chips  and  took my order for a Combo with a dogfish shark taco  and  a Carne Asada one.  There were an array of salsas available on an iced table,  and  I tried several of them with the chips while I waited for the main items.  The chips were blah, but the salsas were good, especially the green Cilantro one.\n\nThe rest of the food was ok too, but it would have been more enjoyable if it hadn't been for the blaring music.  Forty minutes after I had arrived, I went up to the counter to pay,  and  one other customer finally entered the restaurant.  So much for it being a busy place.\n\nWham!  Instead of $6.99, I am being charged $8.79!  What's this?  Vanessa points out to me that in tiny print at the bottom of the menu it says that if your two tacos aren't the same as each other, then it's $8.79.  That's too much for what it was.\n\nBack home, I looked at La Condesa's menu on their Website.  There, they do tell you up at the top that they will charge you extra for two different tacos, but the new higher price shown there is $7.59, not $8.79.\n\nToo many problems here,  and  I'll never return, but since the food itself was pretty good, I'll bring it up to 2-Stars.    :-("""""""

<review>OMG....last night was a nightmare. We were (not) served by the most incompetent server,who was rivaled in his rudeness and seconded by the manager on duty.  Two drinks ordered were unavailable as there was none of the requested mixer( orange juice and 7up, or Sierra mist)\nWe waited (me without a beverage) for 35 minutes for our pizza (they were not overly busy) at which point we enquired of the manager as to when it might be expected.  He disappeared and returned several mi urea later to inform us that it would take another 25 to 35 minutes. We left!.... avoid this restaurant. Grimaldis in Old Town, Scottsdale is fabulous.  Go there .   Had to give it 1 star, but it actually this particular store deserves zero.  Get a new manager and fire the bald waiter.

<review>It's taken me 2 1/2 years to get back around to this McDonald's, here in my neighborhood.  In the meantime, they have done a complete remodel,  and  it's nice inside, featuring a clean, modern look,  and  game computers to use (free) at two of the booths!     :-)\n\nUnfortunately, there WERE some issues this morning, more important than getting to play a game along with eating.  To start with, there was a nice new hand's free paper towel dispenser in the Men's Room, but no paper towels in it!  I tried to dry my hands on the silly air blower for a while,  and  then when I gave up on that, had to use toilet paper to open the door.  Not ok!     :-O\n\nThere wasn't enough help, so the service was slow.  Also, the coffee also tasted hours old.  (I usually really like McDonald's coffee.)     :-O\n\nThis location could be at least one more Star if they'd just tighten up their act a little.\n\nSausage McMuffin with Egg $1.79, Sr. Coffee $.89

<review>I was near this part of town a while back and was wanting a nice little breakfast.  I saw this places was rated pretty high on yelp and figured I'd give it a go.  It looks pretty much just like any and every other coffee shop you've been into.  This nothing out of the ordinary about the looks, which if you are going for a coffee shop that's probably a good thing.  I ended up getting a double espresso and a slice of the quiche.  The quiche was heated up in the microwave and the coffee was served.  The food looked amazing but was far to under seasoned.  I guess they thought that the Parmesan cheese on top would be enough to season the entire thing, but they were really underestimating that.  The coffee was good, it's pretty hard to mess up an espresso.  \n\nI didn't rate it very good, but would I go back?  I think so.  I might give them another try, and get something other than the quiche.  Their baked good looked pretty good and their price wasn't crazy or anything.  If I'm in this area again I will probably stop by and they may make me change my review.  I'll keep my fingers crossed.
</review>
<review>First off, the servers here are lifeless and lame. No personality and they look sour. They mope around and look like its a hassle for them to be at work. As I noticed the owner, it became clear why everyone is so unhappy. This man could easily be the most serious, grumpy, old man i have ever seen in a restaurant. He didnt have the friendly vibe going on at all.  If he is so unhappy, he should retire and get on the road!\n\nThe food is decent. I have definitely had more satisfying food for a less cost. Such as: the vig or mazies. \n\nIn conclusion - stuffy staff and overpriced lousy food.

<review>"""We really wanted to like Lucille's, really, we did. I married a Southern boy, so as I was reading the online menu to him, he decided he really wanted to go. Unfortunately for Lucille's, we've already been to Bobby Q's and Lucille's just does not stack up.\n\nDRINKS: Hubby had an interesting dark beer made by Albita Ale in Louisiana (although our server mistakenly said it was from Mississippi) called Turbo Dog which had some rich coffee tones. I am not usually a dark beer drinker, but I liked it too. I had the sweet tea which was served in a big mason jar with a sprig of fresh mint. It was sweet, but not LoLo's sweet (God love ya' LoLo's, but you're not exactly helping prevent the diabetes!) and that's a good thing. \n\nAPPETIZERS: Hubby just had to have him some fried okra. I tried two pieces to be a good sport, but the interior texture is something I just can't get over. He thought it was delicious and preferred the mustard dipping sauce over the spicy ranch. We were also served some biscuits (which we both felt were also made with some corn meal and this made them a little tougher) and some \apple butter\"""" which was not really apple butter, but rather some sweetened butter tinged with cinnamon. Not impressive.\n\nMEAT: Hubby had the brisket and I had the tri-tip. The brisket is so far superior at Bobby Q's in terms of tenderness. Lucille's wasn't awful, though, and the \""""mop sauce\"""" which is different from the three sauces that were in bottles on the table (original, Memphis, and Hot  and  Spicy) was really good, and I usually don't like BBQ sauces. My tri-tip was very smoky in flavor, but rather dry. I asked for it dry (meaning no sauce) and was even challenged to do so by the menu itself which claimed that the true test of good BBQ was having it sauce-less. And so I did. And Lucille's did not pass the test on the tri-tip.\n\nSIDES: Hubby had shoestring fries which we both agreed were delicious, and also the peanut slaw, which is a vinegar based cole slaw tossed with peanuts and peanut oil. It also had large pieces of yellow and red bell pepper in it, which made it inedible for me, but Hubby thought it was quite tasty and certainly different from any slaw he'd ever had.  I had the macaroni and cheese and roasted corn. The corn was delicious, but I had no idea it would be on the cob. At Bobby Q's, they roast it, slice it off the cob and serve it in a little bowl, which I prefer. The mac and cheese was an abomination for a place that claims to serve Southern food. I am not sure there was any real unprocessed cheese in it. I have had better from a Kraft Deluxe box.\n\nDESSERT: I am glad we tried the dessert because the banana pudding was the true standout. I have never had banana pudding that has not been from a can, so the homemade version at Lucille's was a treat. It had some pieces of fresh banana and vanilla wafers tossed throughout the large serving (more than enough for 2). It was topped with real whipped cream (not Redi-Whip).\n\nSERVICE: The service was quite good, attentive but not annoying. A manager stopped by our table toward the end, and Hubby made a comparison between Lucille's and Bobby Q's. The manager said that a few other managers had come over from Bobby's to Lucille's, and implied that something was amiss at Bobby's in the overall running of the place. Whatever that is, it is not overt, as Hubby and I never noticed that there was an issue with food quality or service at Bobby's. We decided that we'll give Lucille's 6 months to work out what we hope are some opening bugs, and we'll return to try again. In the meantime, you'll see us at Bobby's."""""""

<review>Went to Zipps the other afternoon for some lunch, have eaten at this place before, and could not remember why it had been so long since I had eaten there again...\n\nOh yea, this is where most of the white trash southern redneck big truck driving cheap ass hillbillies hang out at plus the food always gives me a stomach ache because it is covered in grease.\n\nGot the mushroom Swiss burger with fries...that were literally shimmering from the grease on them, and got the brownie skillet...for desert and could not believe this was 7 bucks was a total rip off of Organo's Baked Cookie. Our bill was over $33 bucks with only two Zipparita's a little high for bar food.\n\nThis place got 2 stars for these reasons alone.\n\n1. It's Cheap\n2. The service was excellent it had a ton of waitress so there was never a wait.\n3. $3.00 happy hour Zipparitas  were good and were very strong.\n\nAlso this place is not an atmosphere for kids...so white trash muffin toppers please leave your 4 year old at home, instead of letting him mingle between tables while you slurp up giant mugs of beer with your tattooed roller derby girlfriend and her toothless hillbilly inbred that can only grow facial hair on certain parts of his face boyfriend.

<review>This review is about the Griiled Chicken Sandwich only.  Or maybe it's the employees at 450 W. Indian School.  Because I like Whataburgers in general.\n\nI tried the Grilled Chicken Sandwich because I didn't want a burger and probably because that great southern sounding commercial voice was touting the excellence of this product in my subconscious.  \n\nIt was terrible.  I hope it's forgettable.  The bun is cloud-soft white bread.  IT came in its wrapper leaking ??, barbeque sauce and ??.  I don't know if that's part of the sandwich ambiance.  The chicken was worse than bad award banquet rubber chicken.  The BBQ sauce was industrial hickory.  One of those made-up flavors that I think is a BBQ flavor cliche.  It was not a pleasure.  I'm not sure if it was the chocolate shake, fries, or the sandwich itself, but the next day, it was a trip to Dr. Montzuma's for me.    Not a good dining experience.  I won't give it a 1 because they put out a good burger.  But for me, the chicken sandwich is what it is - bird DOA.

<review>"""I want to give four stars for the food, but one for the service, which is sad because I love their Sicilian Pizza.  It's always good and two pieces fill me up making lunch the next day easy.  This is the third time my family and I have gone there and the third time the service was excruciatingly slow.  We got there around 7pm on a Friday and there was one hostess working the front and only helping one group at a time.  Hello?  How about taking names and party size?  It wasn't even that busy, the place was  1/2 full.\nWhen we finally got seated our server was over quick and took our drink orders.  Drinks arrived and our order was taken in a timely manner. . .so far, so good.\nI'm pretty sure that our server either forgot our ticket or the kitchen lost it because it doesn't take 35 minutes to drop an order of cheese sticks.  5 minutes in the fryer and you're done. I'm pretty sure it was our server because the tables he was handling were all waiting, while others who came in after him were being served.  We did the whole \look annoyed\"""" thing but the wife noticed our server avoiding eye contact.  I stopped the hostess three time as she walked by for more drinks, which she graciously got us (making up for the seating fiasco)\nThen I did something I don't normally do.  I asked for the manager.  I told him we love the food but this was the third time we had been there and the service was slow each time.  To his credit, he comped our entire meal (minus my beer.)  We leaned over to the table next to us that had 3 older couples out for dinner that had been waiting almost 40 minutes for their meals and told them we had been comped and they should complain too.  When we left they still hadn't been served. I sincerely hope they complained and got their meals for free too.  On our way out the manager was by the register and so was the hostess that helped us, I paid for the beer I had and tipped the hostess $20, telling her and the manager she actually did most of the serving, so she deserved the tip.  Come to think of it, I don't know what happened to our server because he didn't bring our food out to us and after we talked with the manager, we didn't see him anywhere in the place the rest of the time we were there.\nI'll still order takeout and delivery from them as I've never had a bad meal there, but my days of dining in at NYPD Pizza in Surprise are over."""""""

<review>Congratulations, Cafe Krishna. You're the first place I've ever given a 1-star rating. I'm a vegetarian an I was fully aware that it only serves vegetarian food, so the low rating has nothing to do with being a disappointed meat-eater.\n\nMy husband and I ate here for dinner. We were the only people in the restaurant when we ordered and it took 30 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. Somehow, my food was luke warm. Speaking of luke warm, the water I was given to drink was warm tap water with no ice. I can handle drinking tap water, but yeesh, throw some ice in it.\n\nWhen we were finished eating, we waited for the check. And waited. I then asked for the check, and the person said they'd be right back with it. They never came. So we waited. And waited. Finally someone brought us our check.\n\nIn total we were there for an hour and a half, most of the time just sitting there waiting for one thing or another. \n\nThe food itself was meh. Nothing spectacular really. I've eaten at plenty of places with terrible service when the food is good enough to balance it out. Definitely not the case here.\n\nI might come back someday and try the buffet, but I'll never be back there for dinner.
</review>
<review>Alot of parking and easy access in the afternoon.\nService was good and staff all very friendly to make the experience better.\nFood quality was medium nothing to Yelp about. Looked better than it tasted. Had jerk chicken that was just broiled chicken breasts and a light carribean dipping sauce (whatever). Doors were open and the animal kingdom came in. Birds flying around and pesky flies and knats NASTY!\nDrinks tasty and presented well. Overall mediocre event . Probably won't do it again as there's lots of options here.

<review>Needed Wi-Fi ASAP and I remembered this Starbucks was in the area. It was busy busy and the baristas took forever to get me an already made iced tea. Everyone was less than friendly and the tables were a mess! This poor guy was having a meeting and he was picking up trash from the empty tables so that the table would be clean. \n\nI stayed for a little while and the W-Fi didn't let me down! 2 stars for that.

<review>With a friend and I craving sushi, and being in the area of Yasu, we decided to give it a try on a weekday night. Having never been there before, I was drawn in by the atmosphere inside. We sat by the sushi bar, which wasn't very big and therefore felt kinda awkward, like a table facing the corner used for Kindergarten time outs. \n\nThe service was a little disoraganized and I have to admit it wasn't the best rainbow roll I've ever had.\n\nWas hoping for another sushi joint to add to the list, but not sure this will be it.
</review>
<review>I've had their breakfast burrito and didn't think it wasall that great.  It was like too much of nothing special.  If you're looking for just a big-o breakfast burrito to fill you up though, it will not disappoint!\n\nI wasn't impressed with the lunch selection either except for the nachos.  I could feel my arteries clogging just smelling it and there's definitely enough for two or more there!!  If I'm ever up for it again, that's probably what I'd order - their nachos.  Everything else was meh.

<review>I lived by Spectrum Mall (it will always be Christown to me) for years and years and it has always had the potential to be great.  \n\nBut for some reason, this mall has never been able to live up to its potential.  Maybe it's the throngs of wannabe thugs that hang out here or the cheap, crappy clothing stores that make it one of the worst places to shop. The last time I went, one of the clothing stores had one big dressing room for everyone to change in together.  What the hell? \n\nI know they've tried to class it up by bringing in different stores, and they have to an extent.  But it still attracts the thugs and my god, whatever you do, don't go to the Walmart.  It's the dirtiest, smelliest, most god forsaken place in the mall.  Stay far away. And if you happen to park right outside of it, be prepared to be accosted by a lady selling tamales and another lady selling creepy dolls. And while I can appreciate their entrepreneurial spirit, they're also more than a little pushy and aggressive. And it's also a little disconcerting to have someone follow you to your car wielding a pan of tamales. But trust me, if you park here, it will happen. \n\nThe food court is truly lacking and personally, if I were you, I'd take a nice leisurely drive up Lincoln, turn right on Scottsdale Road and spend the day at Scottsdale Fashion Square- where the fitting rooms aren't communal and you won't be asked to buy a creepy doll.

<review>Won't be back anytime soon . . .\nWent back for our second visit, itching to use a gift card that was soon to expire.  Arrived shortly after happy hour, and were seated at a high top next to the back door.  Not a great table--I immediately noticed the stains on the wall next to the table (soy sauce?).   We ordered the pork potstickers, which were tiny and overcooked.  I asked for the mustard to come on the side, so they didn't give us any.  Next came the hot lips roll--sounded good but looked like a pink mayo-globbed mess, no way to eat with chopsticks, and forget picking it up with your hands!   My date liked it,  however.   I had a little sushi (nigiri), sake and maguro--decent quality.  My date had the beef and broccoli, which was decent, and I asked for a side order of the wok vegetables.  I expected my vegetables to be a small side dish, but they came out as big as an entree.   Quantity, but not quality--they were mushy and sitting in a puddle of soy sauce (couldn't make out any other flavors).   Service was so-so, maybe because we were hidden in the corner.  I'm glad we had a gift card, or I would have been even more disappointed.  Better sushi at AJ's, honestly.
</review>
<review>This used to be my favorite restaurant for special occasions.  Such a dissapointment when we went there in July for our anniversary.  Service was just teriible.  So understaffed.  My fish was overcooked and no apology made when I had it sent back.  I used to just love this restaurant - all the history and fine service  Not anymore.  The matredee stood at his desk gossiping with 2 friends while we waited and waited to be acknowledged.  Sad......this used to be one of the best.

<review>I was accused of training my wife for compensation and was told to leave the gym or he (Page the trainer) was going to call the cops.  I don't know how a trainer confuses me working WITH my wife with training my wife for compensation.    Management handled this issue horribly.   Their lack of attention to the matter showed exactly what a customer of 6 years was worth.   You are treated only as a number.  Do yourself a favor and stay away.  I have since started going to a gym which is much more expensive but worth every penny to be treated with respect.

<review>it was too expensive for that you are getting.  I ordered 6 oysters and paid 24 dollars from them?!!?\n\nplus they made me sick as a dog the next day.  What a joke.  The truffled frittes sound amazing when described, however they are gross and oily!\n\nthe salmon was all right, but soaked in butter, again oily... and i got a steak. it was small and the flavor was too salty... \n\nagain, it sounds better than it is, if you want to pay a lot for the atmosphere, then go ahead...\n\nor try tarbell's in phoenix.  at least he actually won iron chef america!!!
</review>
<review>Well... where do I begin...\n\nThe parking lot is INSANE. \n\nThe atmoshphere is good, open kitchen, which was fun watching the chefs. \n\nThe employees were great, friendly, and knowledgeable. \n\nThe food... not so much. We started off with the chicken meat balls. Had no taste, and had way too much of some herb. I had the petite chicken as my dinner. This dish as well, had no taste. It was nothing special. For $16.00, I hoped it would have been amazing. Will not be back. This place is just too expensive for the lack of taste it offers.\n\nOn a side note.. if you bring in your own birthday cake... they charge you $1.00 per slice. WHAT!! Yes boys and girls... THEY charge YOU $1.00 PER SLICE of your OWN birthday cake YOU bring in.

<review>"""okay i have re-visited this place last saturday and was extremely unhappy with the fact that after eating a perfectly made crunch roll (made with real crabmeat) my california roll was rancid. I have to wonder if the server just forgot about it, and left it sitting on the bar for pickup, as it arrived about 20 minutes after our first one. my unhappiness and my the redistribution of stars is much more for the fact that, after asking our server to take it away and replace it with another crunch roll, he returned holding the roll and said \that flavor is because this roll is made with imitaion crabmeat and real crabmeat, so there is a slightly different taste\"""" i explained that it wasn't the flavor, but the taste of rancid old fish. i have to say that in my 15+ years of eating sushi, i have never been re-served rancid rolls. don't they know that because this is the desert, fish has to be flown in to be fresh, and at 11pm at night, when a customer tells you the fish is bad...it  more than likely is. so for all of you servers out there,  when a customer tells you the fish is rancid,  just replace it! i'll give them another chance, but it won't be for california rolls (how funny i normally don't even order them, but wanted to taste the difference from that and my favorite Crunch roll) serves me right for experimenting!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1st review of Moira was this one....\nfinally! a place where us late night eaters can go for some delicious and very well prepared sushi in downtown phoenix. i got an email with a note about the newly added happy hour menu (both regular and reverse) and was excited to go try a sampling of the artistic sushi i savored over while reading reviews and sampling experiences, in the local zines. i was surprised that we could arrive at 10:45pm on saturday and the kitchen would still be open with people eating and enjoying a late night rendevous. we sat at the sushi bar, on the most uncomfortable chairs you could ever imagine. the chairs look cool and fashionable, but i still have bruises on my legs from getting in and out of my metal box of a chair. i will never sit at the sushi bar again, so long as they have them chairs (dang one should never say never!) \n\nthe food was very fresh, colorful and artistic. the presentation and combinations are phenominal. the miso soup was so authentic and filled to the brim with tofu and cost less than $4 for a cup of tofu filled, yummy, light and fresh miso soup, dang you just can't go wrong! (lucky you tofu lovers-i'm not a fan myself so this was actually a negative for me)\n\nI had the cucumber salad and must say, i was thrown for a loop with this one.  i'm a cucumber salad (sunomono salad) loving fool if i gots to say so myself. Funny thing, i'm not a fan of raw onions so my first reaction to the cucumber salad was \""""YUKKIE\"""" (just in my head) until i tasted it. the onions were so thin, that they tasted delicious in the salad. it added another bite to it, which was needed, because the dressing wasn't authentic in half vinegar to half sugar. they may be thinking of the diet craze, because there was much less sugar in it than there should have been, it was slightly vinegary. \n\ni was pleased with every roll i had! only brought home 2 pieces out of 3 rolls just for me. my sister played it safe and just ordered one roll, squid salad and miso soup. I have to say her squid salad was deo, but only a few bites for me please. \n\nthis is definitely a place for all occasions and all sizes of parties, from 1-10 people so utilize happy hour responsibly. get your group on at moira and your friends will love ya for introducing them to the most tasty dishes in town!"""""""

<review>This particular TJX is a perfect 20 minute time killer on a Saturday. You walk in, look at the clothes racks, decide they look exactly like the last time you were here, and head to the exit. But just before exiting, you look to the left and see the vast array of well priced, quality luggage. After doing this myself on many occasions, I can now write that I own enough luggage for a family of twelve.\n\nMany TJX stores have a decent clothing selection, however, this store is not one of them.

<review>I was excited to go to a place that specialized in chicken strips.  I love chicken strips so I was thinking this would be like the In and Out Burger of chicken strips- simplified menu for an amazing food product.  Not the case.  It's average or even below average chicken strips and fries for not a great price. I think Wendy's, Jack and the Box and Denny's have better chicken strips.  The sauce was strange tasting too.  If you really want good chicken strips try Four Peaks chicken strips.  Amazing.
</review>
<review>"""I definitely will not be running back to this restaurant....if you can call it that.\n\nI understand that when I got there that it was pretty late, but the place wasn't empty and about to close, so I DO expect good service.  First of all it took waaaay too long to get anyone to notice that we had sat down at one of thieir booths.  Our dumb waitress Jennifer was barely around and we couldn't tell if she was our waitress or the dumb brunette there that could not stop giving us dirty looks.  The manager i think he was, couldn't stop being a huge douche about the fact that I was the only underage person there.  He went out of his way to come by our table and say, oh yeah your waitress asked if I had checked your IDs before when you came to the bar for a drink, so I made sure to let her know that you (points) at me, were the underage one.  Well thanks you asshole, but pretty sure I ordered a god damn coke, and not a beer.\n\nWhen we had gone to the bar before hand for a drink, I asked for a coke, (this bar is about a 10 seater so you can see everything) and he got everyone their alcoholic drinks, and left me without a drink. Even though, I was sitting directly in front of his \work area\"""".  Pretty sure you can see that my drink coaster is without a drink.\n\nNow to tell you about the horrible food that came out COLD.  The spinach dip was discusting too.  Didn't have any silverware, napkins or side plates untill half way through the meal.  Couldn't get a refill on ANY of our drinks.  I had my empty soda glass sitting at the head of the table and she walks by, \""""need anything else?\"""" and the glass is sitting right in front of her.  Uh yeah....She added someone elses tab onto our bill without saying anything or asking.  Then took her a lifetime to put it on a seperate bill.  All in all, everything was just insanely horrible.  Worse than denny's and sorry guys, but that means A LOT.\n\nLet it be known, we're in an economic depression right now, and the first businesses to feel that depression is restaurants, and as a server, you gotta milk every table that you're lucky enough to get as much as you can, because those restaurant doors could be closed the next day for good."""""""

<review>This place was a total waste of money, time and effort. I went there with a friend after a late lab class. I ordered the brisket, which for me, is the standard for any bbq joint. Anyways, our food comes out at room temperature. Honestly, nothing is worse than room temp bbq. We were suspicious right away since the food came out so fast. Anyways, when we complained to our server, he grabbed the manager who ended up comping the meal for us, which was nice. He explained that they smoke everything before, then finish it on the grill to order. Obviously ours weren't grilled much (or at all). They were apologetic about it, but the server said that since he recognized my friend from coming in before, that it wouldn't be a big deal to comp it for us. But shouldn't you comp something like that for any customer? Not impressed.

<review>I was seeing a movie across the street and decided to try out the Paradise Valley Burger Company.  It is located in a strip mall across the street (southeast side) from the hospital.  The restaurant is small and has a homey atmosphere.  I went around lunch time and it was full.  I ordered my son the kid's meal that comes with chicken fingers and fries.  Unfortunately the chicken fingers were burnt and I had to send them back for edible ones.  The replacement ones were overcooked, dry and had little taste.  The fries were standard.\n\nMy wife ordered the Caesar salad that consisted of a mayonnaise based dressing that tasted horrible.  Finally, I had soft shell tacos that were good, not great.  The prices are reasonable, but I have yet to find a reason to return.

I finally got some assistance when I picked up the paging phone and across the intercome told the store I was a customer in photo that needs help.

<review>We were there for New Year's eve, arrived at the time of our reservation and were told it would be a half an hour and someone would bring out food while we waited. Nice thought. After an hour and no food we were seated on a heated patio where you were either right under a heater or in a draft. Better to go for lunch or sometime when it if far less crowded. \n\nI had scallops which were good but for $32, I expect more than just 4 scallops. My wife had a half portion and got two scallops for $18. Maybe a vegetable would have been nice. Quality was great but expensive. \n\nThis is a place to eat if you are looking for great food, are on an expense account, and aren't looking for quiet atmosphere.

<review>I've been on a Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi) kick for the past month or so.  My banh mi bellwether is definitely Lee's Sandwiches, but Chandler is quite the trek for me, so I've been on the lookout for good banh mi in CenPho.  I read about Thao's Sandwiches here on Yelp and thought I'd give it a shot for lunch yesterday.\n\nBy far, the best part of my Thao's experience was the price.  I ordered a grilled pork (thit nuong) banh mi, and it cost me all of $2.71.  It's hard to complain about anything if you're out less than $5.00.  The sandwich's innards were all delicious.  The vegetables were fresh and pleasing to the eye, and the grilled pork was thinly sliced, as I like it.  As far as the inside of my sandwich, I'd give it 4 stars.  \n\nBut my favorite part of bahn mi is the bread, and the bread at Thaos did not meet expectation yesterday.  I want my banh mi bread crispy on the outside and soft below the crunchy crust.  The Thao bread was uniformly soft - it was like a Vietnamese torta or something.  And that made me sad.  I really wanted to look past that, but it was impossible for me.\n\nAlso, the customer service left a lot to be desired.  It seems like Vietnamese establishments sometimes get a pass on this criteria, but they shouldn't.  I ordered my sandwich, and when I told the woman at the cash register that I was planning on eating it on site, she gave an exasperated sigh, and looked across the restaurant, scanning - it was evident there were several four tops available, but it was almost lunch time, and I think she felt like I'd take up space better used by a group larger than my one-man party.  I didn't want to disappoint her, so I told her I'd take the sandwich to go, and brought it home instead.  Oh well.\n\nSo overall, I give Thao's two stars - if the bread were better, I suppose I could have given it a third. But I'll keep on my quest for the best banh mi in town, and likely not return.

<review>J and I had to go to the Fossil store last Thursday because his 2 watches needing repairing.  Forgetting where the entrance that's right next to the store, we ended up walking through Nordy.  \n\nJust outside the top floor doors of Nordy, there's Caketini.  A cute little shop, which I think the original shop that was there years ago used to be affiliated with selling Nordy cookies.  \n\nSweets + Me = Yummyness for Baby C and I!  I couldnt resist, so we went inside. \n\nI originally was just going to get a cake pop.  But I decided to get a German Chocolate Cupcake (MY FAVORITE!!!) and a vanilla pop.  J got the Key Lime pop and a Smore cupcake.  \n\nJ liked his pop.  Love?  That I'm not sure of.  I on the other hand did not enjoy mine, at all!  It was very gummy and almost had the texture of cake with paste.  You know paste, the kind your teacher told you not to eat as a kid in the classroom.  I gave the rest to J.  \n\nNow the cupcakes.  \n\nJ said the Smore frosting stuff was cloying and the cake was dry.  He didnt even eat half of his.  My cupcake too was very dry.  And the traditional GC frosting (which I love) was one note.  I didnt even eat 1/4 of the cupcake. Now if I hadnt already known what German Chocolate cake tasted like, and had tried this....I doubt I would every try GC again.  \n\n$12+ for a lot of disappointment.  :(\n\nI seriously wonder if the reason for the dry cake is because they have everything in a cooler case.  \n\nI am having flashbacks from a certain little bakery/cupcake shop I reviewed for my wedding bakery.  \n\nMake the memories go away!!!!

<review>You know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them?

<review>Very disappointed!! We ordered 2 cerviche    tostadas, carne asada taco, and a grilled and breaded fish taco. When we were being rung up we were told there would be a .75 cent charge to use our credit card. The cashier wasn't friendly and quite rude when we asked for help with the menu. When we asked for chips she said that would be an additional $2.00. When the chips came they were cold and gross. Our food came out in two separate orders and lacked flavor. There was hardly any meat on the tacos. When we left I asked for a refill on my Coke and the cashier told me it  would be another full soda charge. We were expected to bus our own table for this lack luster overpriced food. Sorry won't be going back!!

<review>We were looking for a place to have a late dinner on NYE without a wait, and were pleasantly surprised that Maizie's was not too busy and sat our group of 5 right away.\n\nMost of us ordered Burgers, as that is the main choice of meal. I was not overly impressed with my Stuffed burger, I'm not sure I would be rushing back to Maizie's.\n\nOver all Maizie's was quite Meh...Maybe I will have to go back for another try, and make sure I haven't judged them too harshly...We shall see!

<review>I just now got back from a group lunch at Havana Cafe. Terrible Visit.\n\nUnbelievably SLOW  service (a TWO HOUR lunch? Are you serious?) and the food wasn't that great. I was really disappointed. I have been DYING to try Havana Cafe for a few weeks now and finally got my lunch buddies to go.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant at 12:09pm which I know for certain because I received a text at that time. We were seated and we ordered our drinks. By the time our drinks came everyone was ready to order their meal. We waited almost an hour before the bread basket was plopped on our table. We were expecting our meals shortly after. Our food was served to us over 1 hour after our arrival. \n\nI ordered the San Juan Combination plate that came with a little of everything. How do I say this nicely? Um, I don't think I will be ordering that again. The Pastele was old and dry. Usually when you cut into a tamal or pastele, it doesn't crumble or break. Mine did. The mofongo seemed like it was sat to dry out. It came out in two mounds and both mounds were greasy and dry (is that possible? yes.) The alcapurrias were tasty and tangy. Still a little greasy for my taste, but they were ok. I mean you can't wring out deep fried food. The tostones were not good. Again, something that was left to dry out. They were neither crispy nor edible. They were fried all to hell and I couldn't eat them. I took one bite of them and sat them aside. They made a lovely garnish though. The arroz con gandules was the highlight of the plate. The beans and rice were tender and tasty and the olives and capers gave the dish just enough zip. The masas de puerco fritas were greasy little chunks of pork that were ok once I dipped them in the mojo. \n\nAll of us were underwhelmed with our meals. Nothing spectacular nothing amazing, and everyone commented that things were cold, or greasy.\n\nNext long wait, the check to be paid. We decided to split the check 6 ways. Easy right? Wrong. It took another 15 minutes to get that done. Just an FYI, parties of 6 or more get an automatic gratuity on their bill. The service was awful and I think 18% gratuity was very generous. We left at 2:08pm.\n\nI don't know if I'm brave enough to give Havana Cafe a try again. I might go back to try their drinks. Usually a good amount of alcohol makes anything taste good so that might boost their rating up a bit. \n\nI was really looking forward to Havana Cafe, but my friends and I agree that this place was disappointing.

<review>"""The ambiance is amazing, driving down the gravel road and actually being on a farm and in an old farmhouse to eat is fantastic. The look and feel of quiessence can be compared to few.\n\nThats about all they had going for them. The service was terrible, not bad, TERRIBLE. Where did the wait staff learn their craft? Denny's? No that isnt fair to Denny's employees, they actually come and check on you to see if everything is going alright. \n\nThe food. We had the farmer's feast, I have done chef chosen multi course dinners where the chef chooses for you, and they are generally amazing. This one, on the other hand, was poorly chosen. When I go to a higher end place and pick the option of having a professional chef decide what I am going to eat, I expect him to know what he is doing. The farmers feast is described as \multi-course culinary journey through local farms, pastures, land and sea\"""" (straight off the menu) well oddly enough my journey was only through a pig sty. Oh? Every course is pork? I know \""""everyone\"""" loves pork but this was ridiculous. My palate was never teased or excited or craving more. The meal was dull and boring. More boring than this damn review. The other major complaint was how long it took between courses. We were there for almost 3 hours for dinner. Are you kidding me?!?!?! I honestly shouldn't be waiting 20-30 minutes between every course. I am sad to say quiessence but you left me more unsatisfied than my senior prom date."""""""

<review>"""I went to PB at Tempe Marketplace for a business lunch today.  All three of us ordered sandwiches, and neither of us were very impressed with our meals.  Two of us ordered sandwiches which were said to be made with a \zesty horseradish sauce,\"""" which he and I both commented was gross and unlike any horseradish we had ever had.  I normally love horseradish, especially on my roast beef sandwiches, so I actually asked the PB employee to make mine with extra horseradish.  This sauce was more like thick mayonnaise, and I think it ruins the sandwich.\n\nAlso, the place was packed.  It seemed understaffed for how busy they were.\n\nOh, but the chocolate chip cookies are always good."""""""
</review>
<review>They should change their name to Fresh, Easy and Fatty.\n\nAre you kidding me?  After all the rave reviews of Fresh and Easy,  I waited for the dust to settle and ventured there today only to find it is a major disappointment.  I find this is a view not shared by several of my friends and many trusted fellow reviewers.  \n\nFrom many comments I expected a Trader Hoe's type place where I would also have to stop at a Fry's to get everything else...your basics.  Well, it is that to a degree, just not as good in terms of price, quality or health as TJ's.\n\nI have never cared for pre-packaged fruit and vegetables -- which admittedly is a criticism I have of Trader Joe's also.  I love being able to select and decide which orange is to my liking at a place like Fry's.\n\nMy biggest criticism, however, would have to be its incredibly unhealthy take-and-go food selection.  This is where TJ's has them beat.  Sandwiches all weighed in at 50+ fat grams.  An average person's total daily recommended allowance is something like 67 fat grams, so eat the sandwich reeeaaalllly slowly and savor it for the rest of the day.\n\nFor a store that prides itself on ecologically-sensitive gestures such as grocery bag recycling, organic foods, priority parking for hybrid vehicles, etc, etc., I was shocked to see how poor their nutrition facts weighed in on many foods -- making a triple bacon cheeseburger look like Lean Cuisine.  Where's the social responsibility in that? \n\nSmall 8 ounce containers of chicken salad measured at 88 fat grams and 980 calories are more offensive than slightly higher prices or the absence of ecological gestures would have been.  I mean, seriously, is there any chicken product in that salad at all, or is it just a tub of lard with chicken seasoning?  Perhaps this is some sort of sick joke the Brits are making at their fat-ass American counterparts.\n\nI left the store with some fruit salad, organic lemonade and a spicy shrimp roll (which, btw was just as awful as TJ's sushi).  I found that the pricing was no different on many items and in many instances was more expensive at F and E.\n\nSorry Fresh and Easy, I don't buy it and I won't buy it.  Trader Joe's, where are you baby?  I'm a coming running back to you.

<review>"""\Why am I here?\"""" was the only thing I could think of while standing on the handicap ramp in a very crowded, very poorly chosen location. \n\nI've thought about the positives: Expansive craft beer selection, relatively quick service considering the space constraints and crowd size, live music, and lots of guest brewers coming in (shout-out to Four Peaks!). \n\nBut after considering all of these positives, I was still standing on a ramp with a $7 Brewdog IPA (which is amazing) in hand questioning why in the world they would put this great of a concept in this terrible of a location. \n\nI can't help but to think that World of Beer Inc. saw an opportunity to capitalize on the craft beer culture that has been pioneered by the likes of The Roosevelt Tavern, Four Peaks, Papago Brewing and Taste of Tops (among others), and forced their corporate concept on to Mill Ave in to whatever space they could find. \n\nIt should be noted that this Florida-based company is being run by the former management of Outback Steakhouse. At least I hope the franchisee is a local and has better bona fides than the corporate Outback crew. \n\nIf you really are in to craft beer, support your local proprietors!"""""""

<review>"""EDIT:  7/14/2012  -- I was contacted by a restaurant representative through Yelp regarding this review.   The message included an apology for my experience and said they wanted me to contact their customer service by email so they could \reach out\"""" to me.  I sent off an email over a week and a half ago and they still have not \""""reached out\"""" to me.\n\nMy review:\n\nUsually a disappointing experience when I go, and I'll likely not go back.  \n\nFood is okay.  It's why they get a grudging 2 stars.  It's family-style so they bring a big platter or bowl of what you order and everyone serves themselves.  I don't mind that.  Though one thing that's kind of annoying is that you have to order side dishes as an extra with your entree.  For example, if you order a platter of chicken parmesan, you just get a platter of chicken pieces and nothing else.  If you want some pasta or potatoes to go with it, you have to make sure you add it on as an extra dish.  Would it be so hard for them to put a combo-type offering on the menu so you get an entree platter with a side dish?  Even if we pay the same amount as ordering it separately, it's still a perceived value and wouldn't make customers feel like they're paying \""""extra' for something that seems like it should be included with a meal.\n\nService is either very poor or just okay.  Servers seem to all be rushed and busy, like they're too overloaded to do a good job.  Each time I've gone, I've had messed up orders.  Once, we ordered cappuccinos before the meal, and the server went and came four times before he brought them during the middle of our meal...and only after I reminded him the first three times he had come back and kept forgetting the coffees.  When he finally brought them he made an excuse, saying he was busy and the coffee machine was very far away from our table.  Yeah.  Last time, I was with a party of 5.  After we ordered our meals, one of them got to the table very quickly (turned out he brought it to the wrong table and it was supposed to go to the table next to us), while the next three meals came out 30 minutes later, and the last meal, my meal, actually never came out!!  He seemed to forget mine and when asked about it, hardly seemed apologetic at all, just a tad embarrassed, and just said that the kitchen didn't have any of the dish I wanted.  Seriously!?!  He couldn't tell me that earlier?  I ordered another dish to-go since my party was nearly finished eating.  But then he came back a minute later and said he checked with the kitchen and they actually did have my original dish.  Ugh.  What a nightmare of a server.  So after all that, I did get my dish to-go.  Nothing was taken off my ticket, though they gave us one dessert for free for the 5 of us to share.  Pretty lame.\n\nBottom line:  Poor service.  Food is okay, but not good enough to overlook the service.  If you're craving good pasta, spend your hard-earned money at a different Italian restaurant that appreciates their customers."""""""
</review>
<review>We decided to take our parents out for dinner only to be disappointed by the loud music which caused everyone in the restaurant to have to talk louder to be heard. My mom took out her hearing aids! When I mentioned this to our server, she just smiled. The wait staff was plentiful, but not attentive. The chips were not warm and I had to ask for salsa twice which came in plastic squeeze bottles. Really? Not the best. The tacos were small, but good. My husband's meal was not served at the same time as ours and we thought they forgot about it. No mention of his coming out soon even. Needless to say, we won't be back!
</review>
<review>Crap.\n\nCrap crap.\n\nCrap.\n\nIs that not sufficient?  Do you need more than that?  Okay: go there and order a reuben, and see what happens.  First, they'll ask you what type of bread you want.  On my reuben?  I'll take rye, because if it isn't rye then it's not a reuben.  Thank you.\n\nThen they will include lunch meat-style corned beef, which just pisses me off.  Because it doesn't taste delicious, it tastes like what you get from a cafeteria.  And then they have thick ass bread, which, in my opinion, is what you put on a sandwich when you don't want people to realize that what's in between the slices of bread sucks ass.\n\nOr, the nachos.  They use movie theater cheese (which is a one-star bonus for me, only reason they have 2 stars) but the chili is totally tasteless.  I don't get how people can cook something like chili and send it out to the world when it tastes like nothing.  Not bad, not good, just *nothing.*  Here's a tip: find something that tastes and heave it into the pot.  Just a thought.\n\nI hate myself for being convinced to go here over slices.  Because the place sucked a fat one.

<review>F this place.  Seriously...  Well, maybe not. The staff is really really cool and the chicks in the nurses outfits are hot.  But, seriously... wtf?!?!?!?\n\nI felt so sick after eating at this pit.  I really don't ever want to go back. And really... shame on me. I knew that it would happen.  It is the only solution to a burger and fries cooked in Lard.  \n\nI won't go back, but I will tell anyone that is over 350 pounds they will feed you for free in this place. Seriously..\n\nWTF?!?!?!

<review>"""Unfortunately, my experience was much similar to Mark's. The staff was indeed friendly, but entirely unequipped to provide proper attention to a patient's individual needs. My therapist, Melissa, was nice, but after the initial assessment she failed to explain in any detail the source of my pain, where it might have come from or illustrate a course of action. Instead, I was handed a sheet of exercises that looked like I could have printed it off of Google.\n\nMelissa often had more than one patient scheduled during our appointments. I would arrive, and she would have me work on a machine while she saw to someone else. On multiple occasions I would spend entire minutes sitting, motionless, waiting for Melissa to come back and instruct me. This is \treatment\"""" - time that I was billed for! This did not seem to be the case with Melissa alone, either. At almost all times there were at least six patients for a total of two or three therapists. One morning a woman even brought her labrador into the treatment room and it proceeded to bound around, off-leash, for her entire session. I'm a dog lover as much as the next person, but it's bad enough I have to share precious time with other members of the same species, much less a dog!\n\nUltimately, I received no relief, no specialized attention and no care. I stopped treatment after three visits and would not recommend this clinic. In addition, as Mark said, be sure to read the \""""Welcome\"""" form - it will inform you what your insurance deductible is and how much has been met. Under my plan, previous chiropractic and physical therapy treatments had not been subject to a deductible, but my benefits had recently changed. I was shocked to get a bill in the mail for $570! That is an outrageous amount to pay for such poor care: patients need to be informed of what mediocre medical treatment will cost them. \n\nI will add that, after expressing my dissatisfaction to the Patient Services manager, she was quick to respond and offer a resolution that I thought was fair. As stated before, the entire staff is courteous and patient, but I would caution that it may be worth your time to seek treatment elsewhere."""""""

<review>What happened to the fantastic food I used to get here?? My sister and I split the falafel lunch platter the other day and the quality and taste wasn't there. The pita was thin, the cucumber sauce was watery, and the dressing for the salad was little more than vinegar. The falafel and rice tasted the same, but everything else pretty much sucked! There were green olives in the salad when there used to be Kalamata olives. Unfortunately, we won't return.

<review>I was so excited to see Chipotle in that spot many resturants have tried that location and nothing stays open. Not thinking this will either. The staff was unfriendly almost rude. They acted like they were being bothered to help and like you should know the menu by heart or something. The food was made so sloppy that my tacos has more sour cream on the outside of the shell than the inside. I only had to drive 2 blocks home and they were complety soggy, cold and gross. The taco meal which is 3 tacos, and a kids cheese crisp cost just short of 12 bucks. Way to much considering more that half of it went in the trash. Yuck, will never go back. And when I talked to my mom that lives near by about it she said the one time she went in will be the only time she ever goes either. Major disapointment.

<review>"""we came because they received a review in the Airtran Airline magazine. So after we arrived in AZ... We went to check it out and was a little disappointed with the food and the slow service, but to be fair...we did like the atmosphere of the place. (outdoor seating) which is the only reason we gave it a 2star instead of a single star.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n\Wolf Pack\"""" 2eggs, bacon  and  cheese between layers of hash browns...$9 \n(small amount of food didn't even include toast for nine bucks)\n\n \""""The Over Easy\"""" Toasted brioche with spinach, fried egg, natural jus with bacon  and  scallions...$9 (really bad...soggy bread...lots of spinach, hardly any bacon =(\n\nThe entrees where small and if you wanted to add a side to make it a reasonably sized breakfast it will cost you more...which made it expensive...like adding toast = extra $1.5....Yikes! It's breakfast food...seriously over priced."""""""

<review>"""I had my vehicle repaired here following a collision where I was rear-ended by an inattentive driver.  They basically did the repair per the insurance company estimates and yes, it's all back together, but I am still annoyed over the final fit of the trunk deck lid.  They never did make it look quite right and every time I look at it I can't help but think a kid put it back together.    Seriously, it's off by a good five millimeters.  \n\nOne statement that keeps ringing in my ears was when the shop manager was helping to set (re-set) my expectations and said \It's a Dodge, not a Lexus\"""".  So ah yeah, maybe the next time I'm car buying, I will make it a point to look at the Lexus's.  \n\nI wouldn't avoid this shop though, since I have yet to experience a shop that is better.

<review>Based strictly on the resort and room, I would have given this place more stars.  The rooms were nice and quite comfortable.  Although the bathroom did get soaked with every shower since there wasn't any sort of barrier to keep the water in.  \n\nThe reason I gave it fewer stars is because of the headache I am still experiencing several months later.  I had incorrect charges from someone else's spa package that were charged to my room, which I was told were taken care of twice after they made me swear I didn't go to the spa.  Uh, the person staying in that room was a 23 year old man who was with us the entire time, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't get manis/pedis and facials on the reg.  But, yes, everything was cleared up after a few phone calls.\nSecond, because of plane trouble we ended up not checking in until 6 in the morning, and we were told they would not charge us for those two rooms for the night before.  That was a lovely surprise!  Then they did.  I just wanted clarification, and after multiple phone calls, messages, and finally a terse message left with the GM, I finally was told the charges would fall off my card in February.  Guess what....  It's April.  Charges are still there.  I've left more messages... no return calls.\n\nSo, needless to say, I would recommend it, but double-triple check your bill and be prepared to argue.
</review>
<review>At the end of the day food comes down to quality and price.\n\nSo I had what ever they call a double burger, fries and a soda.  Came to $8.50 tax included.\n\nSo a couple immediate observations...\n\nAbout price.  I can get the same meal at In and Out for at least $2 cheaper.  I can get a far larger burger at Fudruckers for the same price.\n\nSo now about quality.  For less money the In and Out burger is far better quality.  For the same amount of money the Fudruckers is far better quality.\n\nNone of the above is to say that the burger here was bad.  Rather, you can get better quality for less or the same elsewhere.  The only thing unique here is how they cook the hamburger.  But it isn't worth the extra $$ over In and Out and doesn't even approach the higher quality bar set by Fudruckers for the same price.\n\nSo at the end of the day I'm left trying to figure out what's the big deal is about this place.  Beats the heck out of me.

<review>Warning: I'm not a buffet person, nor will I ever be. The concept of unlimited food disturbs me so read on with caution... \n\n\nKind of a scary place but if you want a salad and lots of it, I guess its a good choice. I love the name 'Sweet Tomatoes' which is why I came here in the first place but there really isn't much sweet about watching a slue of morbidly obese children return to the ice cream machine 5 times for refills.

<review>"""This place makes me think of the famous line: \I coulda been a contendah.\"""" My Florist has so much unfulfilled promise. \n\nYou walk in and the hard wood floors and bright airy space make you think you've walked into a truly urban and unique experience. It's exactly what I might have imagined for a downtown restaurant. \n\nWe started with an appetizer -- the nachos. This is the highlight of my visit. The nachos are served on pieces of toasted baguette with melted cheese. On the side they serve slices of avocado and the salsa is served in a halved avocado shell. It's an interesting presentation and was very tasty. But this is where my pleasure ended. \n\nFor my lunch, I ordered a grilled chicken salad and my friend ordered a Roast Beef sandwich. First, my grilled chicken was not \""""grilled\"""" and it tasted odd. As a matter of fact, I called the waiter over to ask if some mistake had been made. He admitted that the chicken was prepackaged and heated, not \""""grilled\"""" fresh. \n\nMy friend's roast beef sandwich looked like \""""old\"""" processed meat - not like real roast beef. The meat on the sandwich had that shiny metallic look (in my mind I'm cringing as I describe it). \n\nI can't believe that a place that has so much potential and uses fresh baked bread from Willow Bakery could skimp out on the food! \n\nDon't be distracted by the big flashy sign and the reviews in travel magazines and local papers that describe this as a \""""unique\"""" experience. That's ALL this place has going for it ...unique. But if you want good food try someplace else in the neighborhood - like Chevrount's."""""""

<review>I do not understand what all the fuss is about!\n\nMy son chose to get take out from here for his 12th birthday.  I won't likely ever order food from here again.\n\nHe ordered the combination plate #6- Chicken Chow Mein, Chicken Fried rice, Sweet  and  Sour Chicken and one egg roll for $7.85.  He liked it.  The serving size was HUGE.  You could easily feed two people.  \n\nI also ordered vegetable egg fu yung.  I was told it is vegetarian.  At first I wasn't thrilled with it but each bite grew on me more.  I liked it.  However, all the food was so greasy and unhealthy that I wouldn't choose to eat it again.\n\nWe ordered egg rolls and my husband said this was his favorite thing.\n\nWe got the garlic chicken wings.  Hugs chicken wings not what I usually get.  However, they were unbelievably greasy.\n\nWe got the vegetable lo mein.  Very black peppery and not very many vegetables.  I didn't like it.\n\nThe last thing we ordered was the vegetable fried rice.  Boring.\n\nThe total bill was $31.  Enough food to feed 7 people at least.  We had tons of leftovers and no one is really wanting to eat them.

<review>"""Boy, they done me wrong!!\n\nI've been going to get my pedicures at Royal since before they became a \spa\"""" and a few years ago, they were honestly great! \n\nThis last time I went, I made an appointment and when I walked in, everyone greeted me like the long time customer I am. I sat down to get my pedicure and got it done by the Russian lady. The pedicure was mediocre, if that. \n\nThe thing that got me the most was that when I asked for the \""""crackle\"""" black top coating, not only was it a hassle for them to do it, but she also charged me $2 to apply it. I understand everyone needs to make money...but to charge $2 for a few strokes of nail polish, when the bottle costs $4 next door at Walmart? I don't care as much about paying two lousy dollars but to pull that when I've been a customer for about 5 years now? Nuh uh!\n\nWhen it was time for my next pedicure, I took my business to Ali's nails across the street.\n\nWill not be returning to Q Royal ever again, and I suggest you don't try them either. They are too high on their horses and don't appreciate clientele at all. And they just raised prices for some reason, like they think the service got better or something??? No. Spend your money elsewhere."""""""
</review>
<review>Honestly I wasn't too impressed with the food. Someone told me that the sandwiches were awesome especially their chopped liver. Firstly the menu is just humongous it took me a good 10 minutes just to scan it. On finding the chopped liver sandwich I ordered that but made the error of asking the waitress for the accompanying bread (which she suggested as rye). SO I ended up ordering the half chopped liver with rye.\n\nThe chopped liver was piled quite high but the sandwich was quite small for the 7 bucks. However I like small portions so this didn't bother me too much Mimi's across the 101 serves similar portions and I don't ind paying for it. However the combination of the sweet rye and gamey chopped liver made the sandwich rather disgusting.\n\nNext time if I go back I'm, getting the corned beef with challlah or onion pocket.
</review>
<review>All this bar cares about is your money  and  your money only. They do not care about individuals themselves. They willingly will treat people horribly just because they like another customer better. It is rather childish if you ask me.  There are plenty of other sports bars that have better prices, better food, better drinks, better atmosphere, and friendly employees. \nThey also have a location at bell  and  32nd st. I would not suggest going there either considering it is the same owner.
</review>
<review>I'm a firm believer that cooking an egg should take longer than 30 seconds. Also, it should not be formed in a perfectly round and oddly fluffy disk. And warm cheese that doesn't melt is disturbing. And sausage patties shaped to the exact same size as the egg disk is bizarre as well. Food just doesn't exist perfectly in nature like this! It's wrong!\n\nOtherwise, the bagel was alright. Just know that the everything bagel is covered in rye seeds, which is weird. \n\nThe coke from the soda fountain was the best part of the meal. I was wicked hungover.
</review>
<review>Pei Wei, why oh why did you think it would be smart of change your menu and the look of your original concept?  I personally think it was a bad move!  I hate that there are not many of the original items on the menu at this new, remodel.  \n\nI had the BBQ Korean dish which didnt really have much flavor and was kind of bland!  I also miss the separate line there use to be for people who called in or ordered online.  I probably won't be coming back to this location.  If I need to I will find another location that has the old items because those items are what made Pei Wei one of my favorites!

<review>"""Sweet merciful Jebus. I will never go to the Tempe Improv again. I used to go years ago, and always had a good time. I have been twice now in the last couple of months, the last time- and I do mean the LAST time- was last night for the taping of \Last Comic Standing\"""". The management needs a serious and swift kick in the rear. The impression we were all left with is that they truly did not give a damn that we were left to stand outside for up to 2-1/2 hours later than what we were told, that we were just plain lucky that we got even one drink, and that the food we ordered- well, it just wasn't coming in the end. But who gives a crap? It's just their customers. Apparently we are all replaceable. A comedian who came up on stage to entertain while the judges and producers were debating the semi-finalists, gave some non-sensical explanation about how the \""""rules had changed\"""" and that they had in fact made the food we ordered, but the staff got to \""""gorge themselves\"""" on it in the back. They then had the audacity to ask us to pay for our drinks. The same comedian made reference to the Improv \""""making it up to us\"""" somehow, but nothing came. Nothing except glasses of nasty tap water at the 11th hour. Oh- THAT was my comp for a miserable evening, starving and dehydrating? Gee, guess I should be grateful. Two stars for Bill Bellamy who was very funny, two of the wanna-be's who made me pee my pants a little, and getting to see Kathy Najimy and Fred Willard. Negative stars to the Improv itself for creating an atmosphere of discontent, hostility, and degradation."""""""
</review>
<review>I love La Bocca, but the management has changed for the worse in my opinion.  I adore the same wait staff, they are so attentive, and friendly. I usually go during the lunch hour, but I don't like that the manager is now the host and we can't seat ourselves. I have introduced myself to the manager, but every time I go ( and I go at least three times a week) he doesn't seem to remember who I am.
</review>
<review>I didn't really LOVE my experience here, but for those who enjoy creative and fusioned sushi or a good sushi happy hour, this is a great place to go.  The menu is pretty impressive with all sorts of sushi concoctions that I have never seen, but I like my sushi pretty standard and not too crazy, so I ordered (ironically) the Crazy Horse roll, which is tuna, yellowtail, and salmon rolled with avocado and topped with tobiko.  I don't have TOO much to complain about regarding the size of the rolls (they were decent) or the taste (it was ok considering this is tempe, arizona), but I think I was most turned off by the service and prices of the restaurant.\n\nWhen my friends and I walked in, happy hour was happening, so it's understandable that the wait staff were busy, but come on.  Seat us already.  Or at least acknowledge us.  When we were finally seated, our waitress kept huffing and puffing while taking our order.  I understand she may have been having a bad day or have been stressed, but whatever.  Stay profesh.  Then, one of my friends orders the tempura mix, and when it came out, it was missing the prawns, so what happens?  The waitress brings out a single fried prawn on a plate...15 minutes later.  Um...no.  The age-dofu was also kind of meh.  On top of that, I was confused about who was actually serving our table because the girl wait staff kept tag-teaming our table with the guy wait staff, and even then, the service was not awesome.  The whole experience altogether just kind of totaled a bit too much for a sort of blah experience, so I'm pretty sure I'll be going elsewhere for sushi around these parts.

<review>"""NOT RECOMMENDED!!!! LOOK ELSEWHERE  I used them once and they were good.. the movers were pleasant, polite and professional. I communicated with a lovely woman who booked my job. I tried to use them again, dealing with the owner (Patrick)  and got the shock of my life. The movers arrived, not at the time I was told they would be there, and I needed to do some fancy footwork to accommodate my 94 year old mother's doctor's appointment before her move. When the movers arrived, they did not bring any packing materials or the boxes I told the owner I would need (isn't it also standard practice to bring packing materials... just in case???). When they did not arrive prepared, Patrick told the driver I did not order them. When I called to complain, he became belligerent and defensive, saying \Well, what do you want me to do about it?\"""" l When I asked for consideration if the move took over three hours, he adamantly refused. (Hello...! Can you say \""""customer service\""""? NOT). He then commenced to quote a conversation we did not have and practically  accused me of fabricating my story.  He not only did not want to accommodate me in any way, he was rude, defensive, offensive, nasty and just plain unprofessional. I chose to inform him that the conversation was going to go nowhere and that I was going to get off the phone, which I did. To which he responded... wait for it.... by telling the movers to WALK AWAY FROM THE JOB. They did not want to , but didn't want to get fired either. Then I was told that if I paid in cash they would do the move. Then the owner called back the movers and told them TO REMOVE MY THINGS FROM THE TRUCK AND WALK AWAY FROM THE JOB.  Leaving me and my 94 year old mother who is on oxygen to fend for ourselves. They followed orders. They took all of our things off of the truck, brought them back to her assisted living apartment and drove away. The drivers were mortified, as were we. They were just following orders, so I do not blame them. But the unconscionable actions of the owner are grounds for a lawsuit, as well as a complaint to the BBB, which I fully intend to pursue. We fortunately found another mover to do the job on short notice, for less money (Budget Movers if you're interested in a reliable company), and five hours later, I finally got her moved in. NO THANKS TO JOSEPH'S MOVERS. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN, AND I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THEM!!! To be this abusive in business, especially  to a 94 year old woman is all you need to know. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!! LOOK ELSEWHERE!"""""""

<review>"""I had been a fan of Houston's (which closed) and was told that Hillstone was the replacement/new Houston's. I decided to give it a try (I was hungry/thirsty driving across town on my way home from being out all day).  I checked in with the hostess and inquired about patio seating (they have a really nice patio).  The hostess informed that the patio seating was limited to sushi menu only.  I asked about bar seating and she said that the bar seating is full menu service.\n\nI sat down at the bar and was sitting there about 10 minutes before I could get a bartender's attention.  A female batender walked to the end of the bar where I was sitting and I asked her for an iced tea and menu.  She brought my iced tea and menu about 5 minutes later.  I waited another 10 minutes before I could get her attention (she was at the other end of the bar chatting it up with some patrons) to tell her I was ready to place my dinner order (at this time, I needed a refill on my iced tea).  The female bartender disappeared right after I told her I would have the prime rib medium rare; I did not even get a chance to also request a refill on my iced tea because she left.  About 10 minutes later, a helper from the kitchen comes out with my prime rib and sits it down on the bar in front of me.  I asked him if I could get a refill on my iced tea and he said that he would tell the bartender and disappeared.  The female bartender was still on the other end of the bar chatting it up with the same patrons/not even looking in my direction so I asked a male bartender, Daniel, that was chatting it up with a group of guys if I could get a refill on my iced tea.  About 5 minutes later he brings the iced tea. The vegetables that came with the prime rib were not what I expected (had some vinegar stuff poured on them and I cannot eat vinegar; menu did not say that vegetables would be drenched in a vinegarette dressing); I was hoping to get a side salad swapped out since I could not eat the vegetables.  About a third of my steak had been consumed and I stopped and was waiting to get Daniel's attention (he was still chatting it up with the group of guys) and a helper from the kitchen came up and was trying to take my plate (thought I was finished).  I told the helper that I would need a box (wanted to at least take the rest of the prime rib home).  Daniel appeared with a plastic take home container for me to put my prime rib in along with the bill.  I asked if I could get an iced tea to go and Daniel informed me that they do not do \to go\"""" beverages.\n\nI tipped 15% (I usually tip 20-25%) put was even hesitant to tip the 15%.  No one ever checked with me to see if everything was ok (food, needed a refill on my beverage).  Original bartender walked away and left me to fend on my own to find another bartender to wait on me. Other bartender completely ignored me/would not even look in my direction.  \n\nPrime rib was good but not worth the $43 tab for a piece of prime rib, 2 iced teas and lack of service.  This place is trendy; if you are not a friend of the bartender, not a regular customer that the staff is familar with (and not ordering unlimited alcoholic drinks), do not expect to get any service or attention.  I will not be back and do not recommend."""""""

<review>We came here a couple of weeks ago for reverse hh on a friday and sat at the bar to take advantage of the HH.   Mr h ordered the Brio burger and I ordered the margherita flatbread, both apps were below average apps. The burger was bland and the Hubster ordered med well and added saut\u00e9ed onions. the burger was served well with charred onions.\nmy pizza seemed more like a thin flavorless cracker mess. I like thin pizza but this was way too thin and falling apart. We both ordered the mojitos  and  they were so disgusting we had to send those back.  the bartender took it personally but they were super bitter and nasty and we could not enjoy them.  I understand it's happy hour and its super busy on Fridays, affordable drinks  and  apps but if you want me to return...please serve some tasty food so I will be tempted to have dinner here in the future.  I doubt I will be returning.

No flavor, no texture, just something to eat because there wasn't anything else.

<review>Sooo over hyped. I believe their attempt at creative cuisine falls flat and is only an excuse to inflate prices. I feel like it should be a rule at any Mexican restaurant that chips and salsa are free. Yet we ordered some--a small order with 3 small bland salsas. We also tried the ceviche...nothing to write home about...in other words don't waste your time. The calamari was tender but only came with 4 strips. For dinner one guest had the burger which got pretty good reviews, as did the fajitas. I had the stuffed peppers not much to say about that. The decor/ambiance is nice which is good since you will be so bored with the food.

<review>The flight attendants were rude (with the exception of one on the flight from Paris to Philadelphia who was not). The airport crew in Philadelphia at the solutions desk were great   dealing with people who missed their flight to Paris, France and got us on a flight to Frankfurt, Germany that was the only time (besides the one flight attendant from CDG to Philadelphia) that did not treat me rudely I think the T.S.A. treats people with more respect. If you want to fly Star Alliance I would recommend Lufthansa  instead they treated me like a first class costumer even though I had a economy ticket! The one other thing is do not expect a modern aircraft or even a upgraded one when flying from Philadelphia to Frankfurt they only have the one screen in front of the cabin and they choose the movie you watch and that was the first time since I was 12 in 1989 that a plane only had that.

<review>This place is okay.  Average vegan food and slow service.  The day my bf and I were there, thye had a digery doo trio performing in the restaurant.  OMG, for an hour, I had to listen to the digery doo concert!  It was sooo freaking loud.  \n\nHad the waffle and it was okay, and they served it with half a teaspoon of maple syrup!  How generous!  I had a tofu scramble and that was tasty I must say, but not worth the torture from the digery doo concert!

<review>Drove in from North Chandler to Dickinson Gateway to enjoy their IMAX.   Got to cashier to be told  IMAX is closed for technical issues.  In other words they do not have redundant projectors. I asked to talk to the manager and it seems they are too busy to talk to their customers.  I called on my cell phone and talked to a female manager or so she said.  Basically its too bad and if you don't like it go somewhere else.  Bad experience.
</review>
<review>The vegan review sounded a bit OCD to me, but to each their own. We are in agreement with many of the comments here ... uncomfortable dining room, a tad expensive, well done burgers (no choice on how they are cooked? ... what's up with that at a higher end burger joint?). The natural soda pop was great and the sweet potato fries also were very good. No patio ... that's a problem especially with heavy A/C. They did try to take our plates a million times. Overall, a fair to crappy experience. Was hoping for more and unfortunately, we will not be back.

<review>"""I have to say that I've really never liked this place.  It was the \go to\"""" spot for lunch at the Gainey Ranch location when I worked in that area, and I always dreaded it when my team suggested it.   It feels like an over-hyped, somewhat overpriced sandwich place that just doesn't hit the mark for me.  I'm not a big sandwich person anyway and their salads leave something to be desired. They are soaked in too much dressing, odd tasting chicken with a somewhat slimy texture and I don't like the set-up of their counter service.\n\nMy mom was in town and she likes PB, so we shared a southwest chicken sandwich on a ciabatta roll and a southwest ceasar salad, maybe too much \""""southwest\"""" in one meal, but it all tasted over dressed and the bread was tasteless.  She looked at me and said \""""we should have gone to Y.C.'s Mongolian BBQ for the same price.\""""  I would have to agree.  I would actually give it 2.5 stars because I have enjoyed the quiche muffin when I'm in the mood for a protein snack (and there are no better options) and my friend swears by the breakfast croissant sandwich."""""""

Our 4 mo old got a cold and we needed a humidifier fast!  So after working a 10 hour day, I run over to BRU, ask for help in identifying which one of the 15 humidifiers they sell is a good one...the lady helping me just read what was on the boxes and concluded that it \depended on what I was looking to spend.\""""  Really? That's all you got?  I noticed that half of the product boxes were severely dented in or visibly opened previously and repackaged.  There was even an instruction manual for one of them between the boxes on the shelf.

The unit was clearly used, the metals parts were rusted inside and the serial number was blacked out.  I immediately returned to the store and told them about my damage product.  They just instructed me to go pick out another one.  I said, \""""are you kidding?  every other box i looked at has already been opened!\""""  I suggested giving me an open box discount on the open box of my choosing and she, the manager, said, \""""I'm sorry, I can't do that.\""""  I don't know how BRU runs things, but if they don't give managers power to give discounts, I can't believe anyone likes to work there. \n\nSave money and hassle, buy on amazon.com"""""""

<review>"""Stingray's decor tries hard to be sheik with exotic looking wood veneers and a trendy  retromod kind of feel. It reminds me of something one might see in \The Incredibles\"""" movie. It does work quite well at night, but falls apart a bit in the daylight (been there twice). This fact actually says alot about the place in general.\n\nOn our first visit, we had a server who I named \""""like-megan\"""". Possibly she refers to herself this way- hence the name.\nAnyway- \""""like-megan\"""" proceeded to tell the table in a wholly unsolicited manner how she was \""""like soooo into food\"""". This made me want to ask her exactly what brand of wholesale imitation crab meat that Stingray uses.

Not amazing, but  fresh tasting and nicely prepared. How else can one remark about Scottsdale sushi rolls except that they are safe to consume?\n\nOverall, if you are into seeing and being seen in S Scottsdale, I would say that Stingray is probably a pretty good choice- particularly the patio.

<review>I had only eaten at La Fonda's Mexican food restaurant three times. The first two experiences there were great. The staff during the day is the family that actually owns the business. The service was fast, food was hot and fresh, and waiter was friendly. However, the third time I ate there was for dinner with a friend of mine. We got there and had to wait around 20 minutes for a table. The reason being is it was a Saturday night and   the place had only two servers for the whole restaurant! What a nightmare! We decided to stay and have dinner since it was already 7 pm. We both ordered there standard margarita there which tasted like salt water....no flavor! Our chips and salsa were good like the other two previous visits prior. The chicken burritos we ordered were a disappointment. The meat inside was luke warm which made me a bit nervous. How long was the meat sitting? We were so disappointed we just up and walked out, never been back since. give this place a second thought before trying them out. it seems like a hit or miss kinda restaurant.
</review>
<review>I came here a couple of weeks back to meet a group of Yelpers for beer, wings, and football.  The location worked for everyone, I'm not sure we picked it because we thought BWW was anything amazing, it was just convenient and met our criteria. \n\nI have been to multiple BWW's many times and I just do not like them.  Service is always mediocre, no matter how busy or slow.  Our server on this occasion was actually a cutie pie and was very good natured as some of the boys at our table were flirting and joking with her and even as worn out as the poor thing was, she still interacted and had fun with them.  My complaint (having been a server before) is the way they had servers assigned to tables.  She not only had inside tables, but the patio as well.  When it is busy like this they need to be more strategic about assigning sections to servers so they are not constantly running.  The needs of the customer are bound to get neglected and their staff is going to be ragged not even halfway into a very long football Sunday. \n\nThis time around at BWW I had the fried mushrooms with a house salad.  I can honestly say these are probably the worst fried shrooms I've ever had.  Extremely doughy with a mushroom the size of a button inside.  Yuck.  The salad was far from fresh.  The lettuce was obviously wilted and that was pretty much all there was to it with the exception of a cucumber or two and some tomatoes.  I tried a friend's boneless wings and thought the meat was dry and there was not enough sauce.  I like my wings drenched in saucy yumminess. \n\nThe reason I give this place two stars is I discovered a new beer that I am a big fan of. Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat.  Make sure you ask for an orange garnish.  \n\nAm I a fan? No.  Would I come back and just drink beer for the pleasure of good company? Yes.
</review>
<review>Despite delicious food and an impressive wine list, it hurts my heart to say that this place isn't worth the trouble. The staff is pretentious and unaccommodating. I have been here a handful of times and every server I have had has an excuse of why they cannot meet my requests. I understand a policy of not splitting checks, but then please let us know that when you are taking our order. One of the servers also told me that they cannot seat parties of five without a reservation. I understand having to wait for a table, but the place was just opening and nearly empty at the time. The menu also gives very vague descriptions making it nearly impossible for anyone with specific food allergies. I love my wine, but I am pretty comfortable with the fact that I will never go to this place again.

<review>Honestly I don't get it.  I went to Dos Gringos with a good friend of mine last weekend.  I had never been to Phoenix before so I was excited to see what the city had to offer.  After entering Dos Gringos we sat at our table for 21 minutes before a waitress came to our table.  She brought us 2 beers and never came back. After 40 minutes we decided to check out a new bar since we obviously weren't welcomed at Dos Gringos.  So we went up to the bar where I waited for 5 minutes so the bartender could take some pictures and shots with her friends.  What I didn't understand was there were maybe only 20 people there and at least 6 people working.  If I was the owner or manager I would be embarrassed to say that you run that establishment.  I will never return and I highly recommend you stay away from Dos Gringos as you will be disappointed.

<review>I hate to say this but I'm not a fan of this place.  The music is awesome and I have listed to some greats acts that have stopped by.  The times I have been to this club have been short and few.  Each time I have stopped for a visit I'm wanting to go some where else.  Its a small club and if its crowed you are limited to where you can dance.  The decor is ok and it might be time for a make over.

I stand all day and it showed on my feet, she removed every callus and did everything that went with the ultimate pedi polished my toes great!

The woman says \""""oh its just an ugly color\"""". This woman hurt my friend by stabbing under her big toe nail when she was suppose to be cleaning under it. She told the woman and the woman did not even apologies but said \""""oh but you moved\"""" anyway she did everything and polished her toes, she asked the woman for a flower and the woman rolled her eyes, but did it. And then the lady that had just finished my pedi went to do my friends gel mani, she was done by the time had finished my brows But she said she was nice and told here about the shop and talked about random things.\n\nWhen we were all done we went to the mirror that lines the wall and to show each other the work, and I wanted to look at my brows again they kinda hurt, when I got to the mirror I realized my gels were horrible bumpy and didn't completely cover my nails in some places and in others were still in the outter edges of my nails. And I looked at my friends toes and her design was kinda smudged and looked really cheap It didn't look like a flower but a little bush on her toe, my friend said I know I don't like it either but wouldn't say anything about it. Then I looked into the mirror to look at my brows and realized right away why they hurt she had not only burned me but torn off my skin in the process! I was very upset and spoke to the lady that did them about it and asked her to remove it from the bill she refused, I ended up paying for them anyways, I,looked at my toes kinda expecting the worse after seeing my nails but my toes were great and my friends gels were perfect! \n\nWhen I went to pay it was 80 something not bad of a price but I only had a large bill so I handed it over and waited for my change , the lady (the same lady that burned me) said \"""" and I keep the change?\"""" I told her no I want my change. She sighed and rolled her eyes but gave me my change I tipped my pedi lady, and gave the other lady half the amount. My friend took care of her tip, and the great pedi lady said goodbye and the one that burned me walked away without another word sighing as she went.\n\nMy friend later told me that the rude lady , the one that did her feet and my gels and my brows was the MANAGER of the store, that's what my pedi lady was telling her when she did her gels! This made me even more upset and at all the bad complaints I had and told her about from the manicure to the wax burn to the torn skin , and she never once said anything I'm defiantly not looking for a hand out or anything but I've worked in the customer service industry for a few years now and I would never treat my customers the way she treated us! Even a simple I'm sorry would have sufficed! SO all in all I would not recommend this place to anyone yes the lady that did my pedi was great but I can't remember her name so i wont go back and i do not want to go to any establishment were the manager is rude and has bad customer service!"""""""

<review>I have read a few reviews here and some rate this place pretty high despite their feedback on this place.  This place is probably one of the only Irish hell holes in Phoenix that resemble those nasty pubs from the ghettos back east.  Dark inside with unfriendly asshole bartenders, and the waitresses seem to run like chickens with there heads cut off when ever your in for lunch or a concert night at the dodge.\n\nThe food is definitely not a love maker, I can only imagine the old cookers and fryers that produce a less than average fish and chips and stale Fries.. UUURGGHH\n \nOnly reason they get two stars? There are cool bike guys that will shuttle  you to the dodge for a concert.\n\nStay Classy!

<review>"""Very AVERAGE wine selection for a 'wine bar.'. That started our lackluster experience. Ordered the hummus plate... Three types (a tablespoon of each) a pita, few shreds of cucumber and a nice pile of NASTY dried out carrots.  - 1st issue = $9 for what I would have guessed to be $5 worth.  2nd Issue = asking the waitress to replace the nasty carrots with more cucumber.  When she brought the cucumber a WHILE later I recommended that they really should not serve food like that!  Her response, \they said they just received them today!\"""" Soooo they bought the crappy dried out carrots -- not ME!  Would they serve food with bugs on it next...if they just got it today?!  What an excuse.  Well now I dont need an excuse not to go back!!!  Save yourself - try somewhere else!"""""""
</review>
<review>Ok this place is HIGHLY OVER RATED! I really would pass. The food was mediocre are best, slightly cold when served. Asking for refills on coffee or ice tea was like waiting for Congressional Approval... \n\nThe menu looks enticing overall, even gives one hope, but seems to fall desperately short of combining what promises to be really good combination of flavors. \n\nUnfortunately the service was just as abysmal. Nice people, sweet, like molasses's about the same speed.\n\nThere are so many great places in the Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale Area.  Don't stop, keep on driving or go to Einstein Bagels next door. You will be much happier.

<review>In my other reviews you'll see that I love nearly all the Fox Restaurants. Which is true. For Zinburger, this is where the *nearly comes in. \n\nI've eaten there more than a few times and on every occasion its been OK. -Which is why it gets 2 stars- The menu is tiny, but its a gourmet burger joint so you really can't ask for much else. The zucchini fries are triumphant. Truly wonderful. The burgers sound amazing when reading them but more than once they've come out just OK. Nothing terrible, but not as mouthwatering as they made them sound. I like how the wine list is portioned out too... pretty cut and dry. Don't bother asking your server about the wines though, they probably will just look at you with a stupid look on their face. \n\nIf you're with a big burger person and you're not a burger person, do not fret. They have TWO really good salads, so don't get too excited. My favorite is the one with pomegranate seeds and goat cheese, with or without chicken. Its very light and fresh. \n\nOn my last occasion my server was slow, meek, and dull. Having zero personality is one thing, but when she realized she forgot about my glass of wine and I had to remind her (about ten minutes later) she became very timid and hardly even came back to our table! I wasn't rude.. so I don't understand why she had a manager come by to drop it off. Anyway, it could just be me. \n\nSo all in all this place isn't bad FOOD wise... drinks are pricey and service has tended to suck.
</review>
<review>I've got to downgrade my original review after today. \n\nWe were seated in the bermuda triangle. We waited 15 minutes for a server to show up, apologize profusely then disappeared for another 15 minutes.  That was the theme for this meal. Sorry for the wait, now wait some more. \n\nGlad they finally got a printed kids menu.\n\nKids pizza was extra greasy, came out 25 minutes before my entree salad. For almost $17 I was hard pressed to find any chicken or bacon in my chopped Cobb salad. Zero blue cheese. I would have told the server but he disappeared until it was time to flag him down for our bill, which took him two passes by our table to drop off. Thank goodness I had correct change so I didn't have to endure another 1/2 assed apology/long wait.\n\nblah!

<review>The only time I will ever return here is to buy simple accessories I am knowledgeable on and can put on my bike myself. Or to get the hot pink I'm with Awesome socks I love. \n\nThat's about the extent of it.\n\nI've been here on two occasions. The first was to start my bike search. When I informed a store employee of what I was going to use my bike for and ask what bikes may suit my needs, I was only shown one row of bikes that were pretty much all the same and all by the SAME manufacturer. I was told that was all they could offer me out of the tons of other bikes they had in their store.\n\nThe second time I biked there with a friend on my new bike, Lady Eleanor herself as a friend had some questions about her bike. They were fairly good at answering her questions. However, I was appalled when they stopped me dead in my tracks and asked me what was wrong with my bike. I panicked for only a short while til I realized they were going overboard on the fact that my pedals are not where most pedals are since my bike doesn't have much of a frame in the center. The employee kept going on about how it must be awkward to pedal (which it's not) and then called other employees over to gawk and make odd comments about my bike. \n\nFunny enough on the way out a woman drooled over my gorgeous bike with its interesting design and asked where I got it. I politely told her where.. and it wasn't at Landis.

<review>"""After reading the Yelp reviews and growing a bit tired of our usual breakfast place selections, Over Easy seemed like a sure thing.  We arrived and found both the place and a parking spot with no problem.  Plus, we were early enough that we got seated right away.\n\nThat's about all of the good stuff that happened.\n\nWe were seated in the back, behind a large wall section (possible expansion of the kitchen area?  I'm not too sure) with dim lighting and one table next to us.  The servers kept forgetting that we were there, and getting refills on water was a bit of a pain.  Can't say much else for the service or ambiance, as they weren't really there much, and we were HIDDEN BEHIND A GIANT WALL (respectively).\n\nThe food can best be described as \edible.\""""  I tried the Wolfpack, which came with the most artificial-tasting bacon that I've ever eaten, and so much grease on the hash browns that it should have had its own mention on the menu.  My breakfast buddies got the pancakes (not fully cooked) and the banana pecan French toast (soggy and minuscule).  We all left feeling hungry, and proceeded to a nearby fast food place for added sustenance.  Also, the coffee was lousy.\n\nSometimes, it's a better idea to stay in and make your own breakfast.  When it came to the experience at Over Easy, that's definitely what we should have done."""""""

<review>I love Chompies.  I really do.  Just stay far far away from this place on Sunday morning / afternoon.  The place is incredibly understaffed.\n\nTable for 3 with a baby.  Told us it would take 15 minutes to sit.  It took more like 30.  We sit down.  We wait 5 minutes, no waitress.  A table next to us get's seated.  They get greeted, get their drinks then get their food order taken.  Then the same waitress comes over and takes our order.  So now we've waited 30 minutes to be sat and 15 minutes to have a waitress come to our table.\n\nI ask for 1 scrambled egg to come for the baby as soon as it's ready.  10 minutes later a manager comes to the table with our egg.  It's undercooked and cold.  Very mushy.  You would think being the manager, he's qualified to take a look at a scrambled egg and know this is undercooked.  It was quite obvious.  I send it back.  20 minutes later our food comes out.  Still no egg.  I ask the food runner.  She comes back with an egg that cooked fine but freezing cold on a very hot plate (a very tell sign that these eggs have been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes)  If the egg was for me, I would have sent it back.  But it's for a baby and I would have cooled it down before I fed him.  \n\nThe food was great but never saw our waitress again after she took our food order.  If we wanted water or extra napkins, I got up and got it myself.  \n\nThis isn't my first rodeo.  My wife had her baby shower here on a Sunday and we got the same crappy service.  I need to remind myself to stop coming here on Sundays.

<review>"""I CAN\T BELIEVE THIS PLACE.  First off, every time we would take our animals here for their routine shots, etc we NEVER got to see the vet.  All we ever got were high school looking kids with huge gage earrings, torn jeans and t-shirts..real professional.  Today I received a call at work from my girlfriend who was crying hysterically.  She said that something was wrong with Bailey, our schnauzer.  She said that she was acting very, very ill.  I told her to take Bailey to the vet, which this vet is the closest.  She ran in and was told by the lady behind the counter that the vet was eating lunch and could not be bothered and after lunch he was going in to surgery so she should just go find another vet!  Are you flippin' kidding me!  What a load of trash!  We will NEVER go back and I hope you don't either!"""""""

<review>"""OH Dos Hippies....how I wanted to love you sooo much.  \n\nI'd been passing this place by due to the long lines around noon, and just biding my time until I too would get to taste the deliciousness.  I should have waited longer.....\n\nI went in on a Friday around 4:30 and there was no line!  I was so excited!  I perused the simple menu and was delighted to find \Cactus Tacos\"""".  This is something I grew up eating, we called it 'nopales', and I'd never seen it on a taco menu.  So I ordered two Cactus Tacos with no cheese.  The very nice chick behind the counter said that the Cactus was prepared fresh daily and mixed with feta cheese.  Okay, I'm not lactose intolarant, just watching calories, so I said that would be fine, just no extra cheese.  She suggested I get three tacos, but I stuck with two, glad I did.  I then paid $1.00 for a can of diet pepsi. $1.00!!!? Get fountain drinks, please.\n\nI waited less than 3 minutes to pick up my tacos from the patio window in the back and sat down amongst a bunch of happily chewing people.  I was excited!\n\nThe size of the tacos was great!  I was really happy I only got two, b/c I wouldn't be able to fit in three. I also noticed that there was shredded cheddar on them, even though I'd asked for no extra cheese.  I took off as much as I could and didn't think much about it.  As I picked up the first taco, I thought, 'wow, these seem cold...omg, these *are* cold.'  Who eats cold tacos?  The nopales (prickly pear cactus) were ice cold. ice cold.  The flour tortillas were also cold, the only thing that wasn't cold were the lukewarm pinto beans.  Okay.. I'm half-mexican and will eat a lot of things in a tortilla, almost anything, but I have never been served cold nopales.\n\nOkay, I decided to give it a try, because I'm willing to try anything once. The first bite was crunchy and my intial thought was \""""holy crap they didn't clean the cactus of needles!\""""  then I realized the crunchiness was merely from the *partially-cooked* rice that was in the taco.  I opened up both tacos, scooped the uncooked rice out and finished them. \n\nI wanted to like this place so badly!  Why, oh why couldn't you have been amazing?!\n\nI may be too forgiving, but I'm willing to go back and try one of their hot dogs....but give me some time......"""""""

<review>Oh no! Where did my Wineburger go?!? I wrote the review based on a hungry tummy and fond memories. Today I went in and it's just not the same. Something happened on January 1st, 2011 because their burgers are different -and bigger does NOT mean better! The flavor was completely missing and the beef was dry. They also do not have cheese pints (curds) any longer. Some distributer issue. BOO!! Also the price seems to be higher. \n\nFail, Wineburger. FAIL.\n\nThe one plus? The service was great. Will I go back? Nope.

<review>Who doesn't enjoy a lazy Sunday morning? I love spending time leisurely reading the Sunday news while getting caught up on a weeks worth of cooking shows. After a few hours hunger finally sets in and its time to find something cheap and easy. While that might sound more like a lifestyle choice than a way of eating, cheap and easy to me means dim sum, and lots of it. With a fistful of cash and my growing appetite I head over to my default dim sum house, Golden Buddha. \n\nLocated in the Chinese Cultural Center, Golden Buddha has been pushing carts every weekend for the past few years. Over those years they've become a destination for steamy delights and have built quite a following with groups usually packing the lobby. Here's some advice, for a lesser selection with no waiting, go early. If you want more selection and don't mind the wait, go after noon. \n\nRanging in price from $2.35-$6.50, Golden Buddha pretty much offers mainstream selections from dumplings and chicken feet to rice and noodles. Most of the cart pushers don't speak much English but know this; most items are either made with pork or shrimp. \n\nWithin minutes of being sat the first smiling server rolls up her cart and begins pimping her wares. As she lifts the steel lid from the first steam basket, the mist dissipates to reveal 3 white fluffy hidden treasures beneath. Know as char siu bao, or steamed BBQ pork buns, these are pretty standard for any dim sum brunch. Pulling apart one of the doughy pillows reveals its sweet porky center, add some chile oil for added depth. Probably the most typical offering is the pork dumplings or sui mai, a wonton wrapper filled with ground pork and black mushrooms. These meaty bites have an enjoyable earthiness that left me wanting to ask for another basket.\n\nThe next cart to come along is absolutely filled with fried items. I love the crispy crunch of egg rolls and while the GB version was crisp, the inside was filled with oil that tasted like last nights fish. After only a single bite the rest remained untouched. Seemingly fried in the same oil, the salt and pepper shrimp were not only super fishy but the shells were also left on. Shell on shrimp isn't usually a problem when the shrimp in question is cooked really well. Not the case with these, they were ruined before they even hit the table, greasy and salty.\n\nOn a lighter note, wrapped in translucent rice paper, the spring rolls were large, filled with chewy rice noodles and 3 plump shrimp, unfortunately these were also flavorless. \n\nA new one for me was the Zhaliang, a long tubular Chinese doughnut that is tightly cocooned in a sheet of rice noodle. The end result is more about texture than bold flavor; I can see how so many people seek these out for breakfast being chewy and crispy at the same time. \n\nDim sum brunch isn't complete without at least one Chinese dessert. Pointing at a plate of pineapple buns or bo lo yau from the dessert cart, these pastries actually contain no pineapple. Instead the name refers to its crunchy checkered top crust. Inside the bun you'll get a sweet surprise of satisfyingly sweet custard filling.\n\nWhile I left satisfied, overall Golden Buddha doesn't quite have the chops they used to, but in a pinch or on a lazy Sunday morning, they'll do just fine.

<review>The counter staff is great at up selling, but will never tell you what your final cost will be or the additional charges to expect when you return the car. I've rented from Budget 3 times in the past month and have been charged an additional $100+ in hidden fees each time. Return your car less than an hour late, expect a $50 late fee, they don't care if you were caught in unexpected traffic. Make sure the price they tell you your rental costs matches what you sign for, made that mistake because the counter agent was talking to me and I ended up paying more than double what I was originally quoted. Will never rent from Budget again after more than $400 in unexpected charges  and  recommend not using them or be ready to pay additional fees.

<review>Went for kennel cough vaccination for my dog 2 weeks back. Front desk lady told me it was $19 inclusive of the booster shot that was to be administered 2 weeks later (there are multiple other places that do it for less than $15, but I chose to go with them since they promised to cover the booster shot as well). I went in today for the booster shot. They said that it was time for his valley fever test as well (I didn't keep record of it since my wife was out of town and she was maintaining his records), so I asked them to go ahead with the test. After administering the shot and the valley fever test, the front desk said I needed to pay $19.9 further for the booster shot and they claimed that no one could have told me that the first $19 covered the booster as well and they wouldn't listen to me when I told them about the information I got 2 weeks back. Also, later I found out from my wife that my dog was not due for his valley fever test anytime soon ($78).. I was effectively fleeced $100 by this clinic today!

<review>Wow, the wait at the drive-thru is painful in the heat!  Even with the air-con. \n\nI don't know if because it was extremely hot and humid that this wait seem to take forever.  But prior to going through the drive-thru, we had parked on the other side of the building and I walked to the other side to use the restroom, taking my casual time.  By the time I returned the same car was still at the drive-thru.  And when we finally made our order and received it, it seemed as though it was too long to wait for a drink.\n\nTake caution:  there are quite a few homeless hanging in the area.

I was on my to Perris CA to visit my dad, taking the bus on the way there was horrible the  diver was a jerk . Then on the way back to Phoenix AZ very bad experience so i pay for my daughter ticket for her own seat because she 6 years old this bus was pack some people had all there seats the diver did not said nothing but this one guy move his stuff out the way but it was only one seat so my daughter had to sit on my lap i was very mad i did not pay for my child to sit on my lap now we are all most there to Az thats when the bus diver finally did something there was a heelchiar on the bus diver he tough he can pull out some seat justva little bit ugh it was a very tight squeeze never never again then what make things worse their customers service is really ridiculous i told them i want my money back they told me they can only give me two options you can credit to your next trip or $25 cash back hell no like i said never again

<review>I think we might have had way too high of expectations for this place. I liked how nothing had nasty mayo all in it, but the selection was very minimal and they didn't give me an option for my side so I was stuck with potato chips. The lady was super friendly and the food was okay, but nothing more than I would expect to pick up at the grocery cafe store on my lunch break. Probably won't be back here even though the prices are good. But I'd honestly be happier with Subway.

<review>There's no point in making a reservation at Breadfruit if they won't honor it.  Or to be more precise, they should be less deceptive about taking your reservation.  In our case, we were given the impression that we'd have to wait about 20 minutes for our little group.  On the phone they did tell us that there was another party ahead of us.  What they didn't tell us was that it would really be more like the 20 minutes times 3 for the four adults and two kiddos.  When we made our way in, the place was half full, but four two-tops were open and a large table for six was reserved.  Not for us, of course, and nobody was leaving anytime soon.\n\nWhile we waited, a party of two walked in and was seated.  A few minutes later, another two-top near them turned over.  A little forward thinking would have been to seat the two at one of the other open tables, and put the other now free tables together.   It would have been a tight fit, but it could have worked.\n\nNeedless to say, The Breadfruit is small.  There is no waiting area and with the kiddos we weren't going to wait outside in the drizzle.  We waited in a hallway that lead to the bathroom until we couldn't wait anymore.  In the end we walked out.  One star for the cute ambiance but for nothing else.

<review>"""OK, I am new in town so I was unaware that they are trying to change the name of this event to The Great Arizona Picnic, or something of the like.

<review>Went there on a Saturday for early lunch. The place was almost empty. The waiter was very polite and prompt with filling our glasses. The food was so-so.  I had a veggie burger - that was a little to greasy for my liking but props b/c it was freshly made - not frozen. The Gazpacho Shirmp cocktail was de-lish.

<review>Have been finding myself stuck in the Phoenix airport more than I'd wish. And, this was close to my gate (B16), but wish I would have walked someplace further.  \n\nOrdered the fish and chips - primarily for the coleslaw and it was served in a condiment cup - literally two small fork fulls - and not much flavor.  The fish was fishy (yuck). They were served with waffle fries which made up most of the plate.  I wanted malt vinegar, but my server was non-existent.  I visited at an off hour (2:00ish) so maybe she just forgot that I was there.  Since I had time to kill the slow service didn't hurt me, but if you're in a hurry I'd avoid this place.  \n\nOverall - overpriced - with my iced tea it came to $18.  Not worth the price. The sad thing is that I think it would have been better to eat at Burger King.  : (

On the Fourth of July, hang on to your hat....and pants....and tubes...and keys.  \n\nI actually held about 6 water bottles worth of liquid from point 1 to the end point 4, but most people urinate on themselves.

<review>I have given this place 3 chances and it still disappoints me. The food is subpar, the ambiance is terrible and the servers are rude. \n\nI was there a few weeks back and my friends and I after a night out were reminiscing and our waitress was the biggest snob listening into our conversation and giving her opinion.  She was rude enough to the point we almost walked out before our food, after a 45 minute wait, was even served. \n\nThis place won't last long in old town. With mediocre food at best, slow service and rude employees there are too many other great spots in old town people will venture to.

<review>"""I had a flight booked for me to go to training for a new job...When I learned that I would be flying US Airways I was not thrilled in the least. I've flown US Air a few times, some personal (including my honeymoon) and twice for business. \n\nFor this trip I checked in online and had boarding passes sent to my phone. I don't check bags with US Air (more on this later), and I wanted nothing to do with their \customer service staff\"""". With me I had a carry on suitcase and a garment bag. As I boarded the first flight, I asked if they could hang my garment bag for me. Every airline I've ever traveled on has a place in the front to hang a bag like this. Not US Air.

You'll need to put it under your seat because this is a full flight.\"""" OK...No worries, as I love a wrinkly suit. Other than that there wasn't much notable about the flight.

This was the height of terrible fuel prices and a recession, and US Air wouldn't let you forget it. $30 per checked bag, and they were charging $2.00 for sodas on the plane. TWO DOLLARS FOR A SODA? I'm paying out the ass for a ticket and my bags, and you're going to charge me $2 for what should be a free Sprite? I went thirsty in silent protest of such horrible business practices.\n\nIn addition, a couple years ago I flew US Air on business and they lost my bag on the return flight. I returned late on a Friday night and didn't have my bag until Sunday...The service at the airport and over the phone was really atrocious. I know that lost baggage people have the worst jobs on earth, but there wasn't even a hint of compassion or \""""hey sorry we messed up\"""". That's why I'll never check bags with them again, and also because I don't trust them to keep my belongings safe...\n\nI will never, ever voluntarily fly US Air. I'll happily pay more just to avoid them. Do not recommend."""""""

<review>"""I absolutely could not say it better than Alicia B.  \I'm only concerned with the fish.\""""  Check out her review for the most succinct bottom line on Ra.  I can't say it as well or in so few words - so I will just tell you what happened to me.\n\nSeriously - I went there for the sushi and trust me, I was alone in that endeavor.  Everyone else was there for the scene.  What has been said here is true.  It is loud music, loud people, over the top decor.\n\nWe sat at the sushi counter, not because they were busy, but mostly because we couldn't get the host's attention.  The \""""chef\"""" (and I use that term generously here) who was in front of us had completely no idea what he was doing.  Granted he said he was new there, but he took our order sheet and handed it off to the next guy because he said he couldn't handle it.  I can understand \""""I'm still learning the ropes.\"""" so I cut him some slack and tried to make conversation.  \""""So, do you like to make sushi at home.\""""  \""""No, I've never made sushi before, but I like to eat it.\""""  You do not get to stand in front of customers, profess you know nothing, and cut cream cheese for a 1/2 hour.  Yuck!\n\nWe ordered: toro sashimi, hamachi sashimi, saba oshi sushi, uni sashimi, some crispy-spicy tuna thing, and some veggie tempura.  \n\nThe saba oshi sushi completely threw them.  Why even have a special order line if you can only make the 7 or 8 standard items you have on the menu?  So the \""""experienced chef\"""" to whom the menu was handed said, \""""you want saba sushi\""""?  I wanted to be clear so I said, \""""Mackerel OSHI sushi, you know, box pressed Mackerel.\""""  I got the \""""Oh, ok\"""" but I was skeptical.  Then he kept asking me crazy questions, \""""You want that with rice? Are you sure you just want Mackerel? No other fish with that?\""""  I offered to just let him give us Saba Nigiri, much simpler.  If you don't have the box or you can't do oshi sushi, no problem - I gave him every out.  We basically ended up with Saba Don - nothing like what I ordered and no willingness to admit none of them had any idea what they were doing.  And it was way sub par saba at that.\n\nSo, they were out of the toro.  No apologies, just \""""We don't have that.\"""" We tried to order the scallop dish as a substitute, but that never came.  In the end, all the better I figure.\n\nThe crispy-spicy tuna thing was almost ok.  Except the spicy was mostly jalapeno and just totally wrong for the dish and the crispy stuck to my teeth.\n\nThe tempura was the only thing that was close to good.  It was too thickly battered though and didn't come close to tempura at its finest.\n\nThe uni was gross.  I took one bite and left it there.  It was slimy and not fresh at all.  I didn't realize when I walked in, but I really shouldn't have ordered it.  This is not the place anyone who cares about fresh fish really eats.  The uni was never going to be a big seller or any good at a place like this.  This is where people go to drink silly fru fru drinks, eat exorbitant rolls that don't even resemble sushi, and to have their conversation drown out by loud music so they don't even have to think.\n\nOK on top of it being a horrible experience, the fish just sucked.  Really, terrible quality, terrible selection.  \n\nI came here on a recommendation, but can not believe I didn't check Yelp first.  Shame on me.  I will not be fooled again."""""""

<review>I went to take advantage of the free ticket deal to see the Immortals with friends - but when we arrived, the theater had suffered a burnt-out bulb and we were forced to see Twilight instead.  While that might be grounds for a negative star review and a human rights complaint, I opted to tolerate it for the sake of science.\nThe theater is about what I've come to expect.  The service is good - you have a call button you can push and the waiter'll come running out to you - and they pretty much cater to your every whim while you relax and watch your movie.  However, the food is hilariously overpriced, which I did anticipate, so I can't say it was a shock to me.  But it's not getting any Michelin stars, let's put it that way.\nThe major dealbreaker - the reason I give this place a bad review - is the seating.  Half is theater seating, which is maybe one step above your normal theater seating, and the other half were office chairs with desks in front of them.  Okay, sure, they're NICE office chairs, but the place just opened.  Wait three months and see how nice they are then.\nWhy is this a dealbreaker if the chairs are sufficiently comfy and the service is respectable, and you knew what you were in for, you might ask me.  Well, here's the kicker.  There are other dinner theaters in this city, and while their tickets are generally more expensive, the general experience is much, much better.  So if you grade comparatively, SMG just loses out.  \nNow, if you're cheap, then just go for it - get there early, get good and soused at Four Peaks across the way first - but if you're looking for a novel, quality movie going experience... look elsewhere.

<review>This is the worst of the Yardhouse locations in Phoenix.  The parking is a royal pain, there's often a wait, and this place gets annoyingly loud during popular sporting events.  Somehow this semi-yuppified place manages to attract all of the thugs who would normally go to a sleezy sports bar and scream at the TV there when their team is losing.  This Yardhouse is in a shopping mall, please go somewhere else.\n\nService  and  food quality are the same as the other Yardhouse locations in the valley.  Beer selection is great but not so great.  If you're a beer enthusiast, you've already tried at least 90% of the beers.  If you're not a beer enthusiast, you probably won't care that there's so many beers to choose from.  I think they missed the mark by having tons of widely available beers at one place rather than having a lot of hard to find beers that people will like to try for the first time.\n\nPrices are too high - $6 pints, $10 for most appetizers, and again - this location is bad for parking and customers.

<review>On the day I visited, many of the exhibits and galleries were closed due to one reason or another--preparing for a fundraiser, renovation. The Contemporary Art collection was really limited and unimaginative. There were very few multimedia works, or multidimensional works. There was a lackluster collection of coture clothing which were not contextualized in any way, shape, or form. Why would these clothes be art? No clue there. Frankly, smaller museums such as the Denver Museum of Art/Albuquerque Museum, and the Panhandle Plains Museum, do far better in their breadth and depth, respectively.\n\nThe only really good thing about the Phoenix Art Museum are their grounds. Great willow acacia trees and fountains! I felt the building was arid and sterile and at the same time dark.

<review>"""We came here on a Sunday night with friends. We were a party of 5, with four adults and one child. First off, the place is gorgeous, beautifully, minimally designed with lovely fireplaces and firepits at just the right spots.\n\nThe margarita I drank was very good, nothing outstanding. In Arizona, you better make a better-than-decent margarita or the sheer volume of competition will run you over.\n\nOur friends who live there ordered their usual, the Monterrey, and they loved it. I had one of the restaurant's specialties --- Ribeye Cascabel --- and I was greatly disappointed.\n\nFirst off, the ribeye is supposed to be one of the most tender cuts of meat from the animal, but nobody told these guys. This was an overcooked, tough piece that was chewy, chewy, chewy. And the cascabel sauce it was supposed to be \basted\"""" in, well, bathed is more like it. Swimming? Drowning? And the sauce was all pepper, no subtlety; two bites into it and my tongue, mouth and lips were burning.  They charge $24?

<review>I've been debating about writing this review.  I love cupcakes and I was so excited when I so this store.  The store inside the mall is very cute.  The staff is amicable, but not overly helpful.  Which is ok, the cupcakes look good, however, looks are not all, even for cupcakes.  I got the Lemon Raspberry and the Coconut, as well as a Key Lime cake pop.  I tried the cake pop first.  It was gummy tasting and neon green.  I have been to Key West and I never saw a neon green key lime.  Then I took a bite out of the coconut one.  The cake per se was not bad, however the frosting tasted like oil.  Not appetizing.  So, I closed the little container and tried the Lemon Raspberry.  I guess I have been spoiled by other cupcakes in town.  Again, the neon yellow color for the cake.  Where do they get these citrus. (see picture)  The cake tasted like the ones from the grocery store.  I ended up throwing them in my garbage, making sure to smoosh it down, in case I had a Miranda moment (only if you have watched Sex and the City you will get this).  At least I know I won't be tempted at the mall anymore.  I guess I should be thankful????

<review>"""I'm always in the mood for a good sandwich, so I stopped by Mike's.  As anxious as I was, I was STUNNED by the sky-high prices for what you get.  I mean, how good can a sandwich be to command 30% over market value, and 30% under volume consumed?  \n\nThe bun was 70% of the presentation, and although the buns are worthy and important, they should be 20%.  The meat and cheese should be at least 50% of the value for the sandwich.  Any good consumer knows that.\n\nHere we go, with no need to elaborate---  The outcome of the big 3:\n\nService:  \nThis part was average, and it's what you would expect at a busy sandwich shop.  We were 3rd in line, and it was 7 minutes before we walked out the door.\n\nTaste:  I liked the taste, although I was expecting SO MUCH MORE because of the hype that they put into their t.v. commercials.  After hearing the commercial, I expected them to be the most-perfect sub, just like they said.  The bun is 70% of the sub, and while soft and tasty, should've been 20% of the sub.  \n\nIt was just O.K., and it's fine for a quick bite at a sub shop.  Don't expect the meat and cheese to overpower the taste, since it's such a meager and marginal portion of the entire sub.\n\nPrice:  Welcome to the 'horrendous part' of the entire ordeal.  I have no problem paying $5 for a delicious sub.  One of the market leaders has been doing $5 subs for years, and I've often wondered why any other competitors that want to be market leaders haven't driven the price down AT ALL.  I expect that they don't want to compete in an American workplace, that is expected to be DRIVEN BY PRICE.\n\nI would even give $10 for the most fantastic sub, like the ones that New Yorkers RAVE about the subs in New York.  Since this is a New Jersey import, I have HUGE problems paying $9 to walk out with an average sub + fixin's.  I'd have no problem unless, of course, Chandler had a average, upper-class wage compared to New Jersey's upper-class wage.  You'll notice that they are NOT the same, and you'll find that they are VASTLY different.\n\nIf this sub would've 'rocked my world', then it's totally worth a $10 fee to escape with their fixin's.  As it was, I was left with a sub-standard sub (less than 12\) and with normal, wholesome, expected, and anti-climatic fixin's.  A big let-down from what their commercials INSIST are the best.\n\nSummary:\nThis shop is overpriced, and they don't get it.  They EXPECT that this is what you SHOULD pay for a 'premium' sub.  The trouble is, that Chandler is NOT Scottsdale, New York, nor New Jersey, and they haven't factored in the DESIRED sub shop that should be operating in a college community.  (we don't need more Scottsdale-type pricing, just college-kid pricing with college-kid type portions).  \n\nI doubt that the owners will agree, and also, please expect that the owners will maintain that they are \""""...doing a good thing...\"""" for the residents of the area.  Please disregard their fantasy leanings, since they don't understand the undergraduate population.\n\nAs far as stereotypes coming out of New Jersey, I'm also sure that these owners, just like the aggressive, post-WW2 unions, would ACTIVELY seek to prevent you from hearing what I've said about their food in this article.  I'm also convinced that they would also ADAMANTLY deny any affiliation with union henchmen.\n\nViva la America!"""""""

<review>Yes... I went to Popeye's for dinner tonight.  I had a craving for popcorn shrimp and it was the closest thing to satisfy my hunger.  Is it just me or are their portions shrinking?  My popcorn shrimp was good and finger-lickin' greasy like I expected, but I could have eaten 3 times the amount! I guess that explains why they don't have a kid's menu and my boyfriend's son couldn't get a damn toy! They have obviously melded the two menus together and now I get to pay $6.95 for a combo that is kid-sized.

<review>It truly pains me to have to write this review of what I would otherwise consider an excellent establishment, but recent events prevent me from recommending this restaurant to anyone.\n\nYes, this may be a bit of a rant, so in an attempt to be balanced, let me offer a little perspective.\n\nPizzeria Bianco was one of the first places that I ate at when I moved to Phoenix earlier this year. The food is very good. The service is good, but I was immediately aware that the business model is very flawed, in that I have never waited for less than 90 minutes for a table. It is true that you can pass the time quickly in the adjacent wine bar, and I have done so on many occasions. The wine selection is above average, and the environment is pleasant.\n\nHowever, the business manager (owner Chris Bianco's ex-wife) is a truly miserable human being (ask any of her employees), and her imprint on the approach to customer service at the restaurant is unmistakable. The management believes that there is absolutely no incentive to provide anything resembling an enjoyable experience for their patrons because there are unlimited numbers of people who will wait upwards of 4 hours for their signature wood-fired pizzas.\n\nAs a fan of excellent food, I do appreciate their attention to detail and excellent craft. But the consistent manner in which I see loyal customers disrespected and outright abused is completely unacceptable.\n\nWhile I do love their pizza and antipasto (which is not, irreplaceable I might add), after many months of consistent patronage, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone.

<review>Took our son here for his birthday last night as he loves sushi. We had a $25 gift certificate and so ordered lots anticipating this. When we pay the bill and present the gift certificate to the waiter he advises us that they refuse to take it as they are in some legal battle with the company that issued it, restaurant.com. Not my problem! Had a valid certificate and planned on using it. We were advised by restaurant.com that it was good indefinitely. Apparently not so! Quite disappointed the restaurant did not want to do right by new customers. So many other places to spend our money.....

<review>"""From the looks of this place, both inside and out, you would think that they would have better deals.  The appearance is what I would call \ghetto\"""".  \n\nThe beds must be old because I thought it was going to close all the way down on my face when I got in for the first time.  They also allow you to tan 20min in  the same level bed that other salons only allow 15min in and I felt as if I did not get as good as color so the bulbs must be old too.  The beds are cracked and look ancient.\n\nCheap paper posters are falling off the wall, they have tacky cork boards for local advertising and even tack fliers up in the room.  I'm not interested in auto-glass, etc. when I'm tanning, sorry.  Music is played out of an old-school \""""boom box\"""", and they still have pictures on \""""employees\"""" on their 'employee wall' of girls who haven't worked there in years.  I don't even want to know how long their lotions have been sitting around.\n\nOne day I accidentally left my Michael Kors rose gold watch in a room, called to inquire about it and they claimed they didn't have it.  Obviously they clean the rooms after each client so I'm guessing that one of the employees is rocking my watch these days.\n\nI have another friend that left her lotion for them to hold there (a service they offer) and the next time she went to tan they claimed they had throw it away.  I'm guessing a nice bottle of lotion didn't just go in the trash and maybe an employee got to put that to use too.\n\nLook around for cards locally that offer 1 week free or $10 for 10 days to new customers to try this place out if you still feel inclined to go."""""""

<review>"""I've always heard that a three star review is the worst rating because it doesn't invoke love of a place and it doesn't bring out emotions of hate, it's just bleh. \n\nI had a nightmare of a time getting my hair done yesterday, but I went back today to talk to the owner and received a full refund. I have never done something like this before, but when I post my tale of misery you will soon understand why....\n\nI have been growing my hair out for over a year so that I could do the generous thing and donate it to Locks of Love or an equivalent. This means I couldn't style it, cut it, or color it the way I wanted to.\nAnd anyone who knows me knows that this was a HUGE sacrifice.\n\nI contemplated many salons and this one was:\n1. Close to my house\n2. Affordable\n3. Clean\n4. Presented amazing hair cuts to choose from (because you presume that if they have haircuts on the walls and in a book that the stylist should know how to do them!)\n\nI printed a picture of a very sexy chin length cut that would have looked amazing on me and left enough hair for the donation. I wanted to go all out and sass up the color too.\n\nI called the salon and talked to a woman, who I later found out, was the owner. I explained what I wanted and she quoted me a price from $45- $70 for the color and possibly the cut. I expected it to be more in the $60 range anyway and made and appointment.\n\nWhen I went in I was greeted and taken back to a station shortly thereafter by a \relaxed\"""" woman. The woman seemed chill, but I found out that soon after she was just \""""too chill\"""" for my liking.\n\nI wanted her to put my hair into pigtails for the donation; she proceeded to tell me the L.O.L. wouldn't accept them in two ponytails. I told her they would. She comes back and puts my hair into pigtails without parting it to make sure that my hair would be even and then doesn't even measure it. I was about to mention how she didn't part the hair but was distracted that she didn't even want to measure my donation insisting that they take it no matter what the length because \""""they are so desperate for hair.\"""" \n\nNo, she needs to measure it. And I make her. She measures the donation with a comb that I presumed had a ruler on it, but after all of this, I bet it didn't.\n\nShe cuts the first side off chin length, Perfect. She cuts the other side off.... At my cheek bone.... WTF WTF WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOHMG. \n\nWTF am I supposed to do now. I tell her that is WAAAAYY too short for the cut I wanted. She insisted that it will look like that when she is done. I felt that I may have been over reacting since it is the first time I am going this short.\n\nThen she grabs her straight edge razor and says to me with hair in hand, \""""Time to carve!\""""\n\nTime to carve what?!?!!?  I'm not a fucking turkey! And there goes the hair on the back of my head. \n\nIt is too late all is lost. What the fuck. \n\nIt's 3 p.m. and I'm supposed to meet a friend at 5 p.m. Can this be salvaged? I can't go anywhere else today and get this shit fixed.\n\nThe owner then walks over noticing concern on my face. She then consults with my stylist (or torturer) about the color I wanted and told her the best way to do it. (I should have never EVER let this woman put color on my hair if she didn't know what to do in the first place.)\n\nBut hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nShe insists that it will look better with the color in it and brings me a book of color samples. I tell her that I wanted a specific red on my hair from the book. The woman looks at the number and tells me \""""we don't keep that red in stock, you would have to order that color 6 weeks in advance.\"""" \n\nReally? Six weeks in advance? Do they grow the flowers and smash up the leaves themselves? There's a beauty supply down the street, I could go there and buy it myself. \nThen the owner walks over. She's trying to talk me out of putting any red into my hair at all because, \""""when you shower or even sweat the color will bleed... \"""" \n\nIt will bleed? I have had red hair color in my hair before AND I see plenty of people dye their hair red. I know red fades, but bleeding when I sweat? I don't think so. Not unless you will be using red koolaide to dye my hair.\n\nEither way, I'm not getting red. So I tell them I want blonde on the top where the layers are and some black underneath. The owner is telling the woman how to section my hair so it looks right and I feel better because I'm thinking, \""""The owner knows what she's doing when it comes to where to color the hair. All this woman has to do is slap the dye on and style it.\""""\n\nShe brings the dye back and does the \""""black\"""" color underneath and foils it out of the way. Then she starts slathering the bleach on my hair and does not foil it, just bundles the hair up and throws a plastic cap on.

I am not talking about narcotics, I am talking about blood pressure and other routine medications. We had no problem making quarterly appointments for follow up visits, but about a week before the quarterly appointment the office would call and cancel the appointment and reschedule for about 2 weeks after we were to run out of meds. This happened 3 times in a little over a year. My husband was a nervous wreck over this practice.\nWe also found it impossible to get same day appointments when acute illnesses happened. My daughter had strep throat symptoms and the office stated that they were too busy to see her. Strep throat can result in kidney problems, heart valve problems, and scarlet fever. We ended up going to an urgent care for the issue. \nFinally, most offices will do your annual physical, send you to the lab for the required lab tests and phone you with the results. This office requires two separate doctors appointments, requiring two co-pays and additional costs for the insurance company.

<review>OVERHYPED! Food is bland and tasteless but great atmosphere.\n\nWe went here and ordered a variety of food (an appetizer, a soup, a salad, 4 entrees, and a dessert).  This place is great for a happy hour and to kick it as the environment is spacious and hip and full of good looking people, but other than that, the food is very overpriced and every dish besides the bison burger was bland and tasteless.  They infuse a lot of culture into their menu but everything is so generic and americanized with absolutely no WOW factor.

<review>"""\We wanted to take you out for your last dinner...so we got to thinking 'what place has specials on a Tuesday?'..and I remembered Chompie's has a special..AND A FOOD CHALLENGE.\""""\n\nAnd THAT is how I ended up at Chompie's on a Tuesday.  They were featured on TV (I think it's Man Vs. Food, but I'm not sure) bc of this food challenge of theirs.  On Tuesdays, they have a special - AYCE Jewish sliders  and  fries with the purchase of a beverage for $11.95.  (Keep in mind, a plate of 3 Jewish sliders + fries is $11.95.)\n\nI was told the specialties here are sliders.  The sliders themselves are a decent size (I'd say maybe it's the same size as the tiny McD's burgers, but taller?).  Jewish sliders have potato cakes in them; Western sliders don't; breakfast sliders are something completely different.\n\nEverything we ordered was ehhhh (befitting of a \""""meh, I've experienced better\"""" rating).  Two things that did impress me, however, were:\n\n1. They place pickles on the table right when you sit down!  I'm not a pickle girl myself, but it's a nice gesture.\n2. Everyone here is so FRIENDLY (I mean genuinely friendly!!).  Idk, I think most Arizonians in general are friendlier than the Californians I encounter on a daily basis hahahhaa.  And our waitress went out of her way to split 5 checks for our party of 7...that was pretty cool of her.\n\nI'm glad I went here for the experience, but I wouldn't come back again.  Lesson learned: Don't trust a bunch of post-gym, hungry, non-Yelping boys to pick a dinner spot ;)"""""""
</review>
<review>The food was good. The service sucked! Our server 'Ceasar' was super nice when he first came to the table. However after our entrees were delivered, that was the last time we saw him. I have never, ever....ever been somewhere that let's a beer glass go completely empty. Let alone a glass of tea, which both happened. The busser actually filled my husband's tea, and another server came and offered us boxes. Then I was finally offered a 2nd beer after I was about 97% done with my meal.\nIt is a shame, because the menu was inventive. We would have tried other items, like we were going to order dessert, but due to the neglect we will not be returning.
</review>
<review>Oh dear, this one of those fusion restaurants, they want to be authentic Mediterranean but they need to be extra certain they are catering to their demographics. If ya know what i'm sayin'.\n\nAnyways, this place is decent. The only issue I have is that the food is overpriced and really isn't very authentic. This fact combined with the fact that its not a lot of food for your money, aka bad value makes it lose a few points in my book.\n\nThe service is good, the staff is very friendly and its worth a visit, who knows you might like it? If you can't make it to Haji Baba in Tempe, or Baiz Market in Phoenix, then I suppose you can check this place out. Don't expect to be wowed too much. I pretty much never crave the food here, and the only reason it might be worth coming here is if you have a party of like 4 or more. Haji Baba and Baiz probably cannot realistically accommodate large parties.

<review>"""This place needs improvements in so many areas! Our experience was very similar to some of the other reviews. We went there for breakfast on a Saturday morning. There was plenty of open tables when we got there, but we were still had to wait 10-15 minutes to get seated. The hostess explained to us that the cooks were 'catching up' on the orders and that's why we had to wait. When I asked if she could just seat us and take our order 10-15 min later, she looked completely confused and said, \uh...I...don't know...I was told not to seat anybody\"""". So there was a bunch of other people just standing there, waiting, and you could see they getting frustrated by this too. \nWe finally go seated and the waitress got our order, she was nice, but took a long time to come back after she took our drink order. We waited at least 20 minutes to get our food. When the food finally arrived, we were not impressed at all! My husband got the El Jefe Omelet, it looked soooo good on the menu, but he was very disappointed. We paid $8.50 for a below average omelet with 1 slice of toast. They charge extra for sides like home potatoes...most restaurant places we go to include the toast and potatoes with your meal, especially when you pay that much! So yeah, their prices are not the best, especially for the quality and quantity of food. I got the El Gallo Torta, and it was OK. We also paid $3 for 1 egg and a slide of toast for our son, and never got a refill on our coffee.\nThis place has potential, I like their concept, but they need A LOT of improvement if they want to keep customers coming back. I know we won't be back after our disappointing experience."""""""

<review>Are you kidding me?  Seriously.\n\nIf you like less than mediocre food while porn is being thrown in your face, you'll find it here.  Seriously.\n\nWe never would have gone in here if we had any idea.  Seriously.\n\nCorporate Suits in town wanted to take a few folks from my office to lunch and chose this place.  There's an hour of my life I'll never get back.  Seriously.\n\nThis place makes Hooters look very upscale and classy.  Seriously.  \n\nAnd the food.  Huge burgers and fries are the only choices.  The burgers?  Think Encore Frozen Salisbury Steaks on a bun.  Seriously.\n\nWe left with the unanimous agreement that none of us would ever see the inside of this place again.  \n\nSeriously.
</review>
<review>I got a recommendation from a friend to eat here.  He loved it.  I did not.  \n\nI went here with my husband and a friend who was visiting from out of town.  We made a reservation and good thing because they were so busy.  The interior decor was charming and the bathrooms were fun.  It was a nice spring day so we sat outside.  And that's when it went downhill.\n\nOur server took forever.  We asked for chips and salsa several times and never got it.  The busboy kept bringing chips to the tables around us but never to us.  Finally, the chips finally arrived -- a few minutes before our food did!  The food was not good.  We each ordered something different and none of us liked what we ordered.  We tried switching dishes hoping we would like something the other person ordered but no such luck.  The only thing we did like was the sangria.  \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  Save your money and go to a real Mexican restaurant.
</review>
<review>Let's just say that it's a pretty cool place that based on service won't be open long. We stopped in for MNF and had to beg to be served! Then they took the meal order for my girl friend, but didn't take mine. One meal came out and they finally put 2 and 2 together and figured out what happened.\n\nNext, we had to actually reach over the front of the bar to get silverware. Most restaurants automatically give those to you.\n\nNext, the ice in the drinks is so small, you have to use a straw, whether you want to or not. \n\nCan't rate their food becasue they never asked if I wanted to order but the service was awful and I won't be back.

<review>While Kai did have an interesting tasting menu featuring unique takes on native cuisine, I was disappointed overall. They had recently increased the price of their tasting menus far above what was advertised on the website (which I've noticed has since been corrected). At the their new prices -- $280 for the large tasting menu with wine -- it wasn't even close to worth it. Atlas Bistro or Quiessence were as good or better, and now, after trying Kai, seem like a bargain. \n\nIf Kai were to offer their tasting menu at a price point closer to that of Atlas or Quiessence, I would definitely recommend them and would not hesitate to offer a four-star rating. The ambiance at Kai, similar to that of an off-strip 1970s era Vegas hotel, was marginally better than Atlas, but inferior to Quiessence. While the food at Kai was interesting, it just wasn't phenomenal enough to merit the outrageous cash outlay necessary to try it -- more than double other locally foced, chef-driven Valley restaurants.\n\nIf you're in the market for a nice, creative dinner, I'd rather recommend restaurants such as Quiessence, Atlas Bistro, FnB or Binkley's, all of which offer at least as good of an experience without requiring multiple wheelbarrows of cash to partake in phenomenally interesting and creative cuisine.

<review>I'm almost ashamed to say that I order pizza here, but I do. It's either this, Domino's (hate) or Papa John's (almost too good if you're hammered drunk.) The pizza always takes forever, and sometimes arrives cold. Last night I ordered wings from their Wing Street and they were actually edible, but the little dumbass delivery guy named Pedro didn't say a word the entire time he was standing at my door. I have to assume you know how to speak, as I'm sure even Pizza Hut has that requirement. Maybe he got lost in the bird poo forest on the way to my house and was scared off by the hazardous waste sign at my front door, or the fact that I answered the door with a gun on my hip. Either way dude, speak damnit!!!!\n\nBut Pizza Hut, you'll be hearing from me next time I overdo the vodka and Grape Powerade drinks, and I'll still complain the next day.
</review>
<review>Well, I finnaly got the chance to ceck this place out.  What a letdown.  Figured I would go basic and order a Chicao Dog and Fries.  Probably one of the worst chicao Dogs I have ever had and I did not like the oven baked fries at all.\nNo poppy bun as I was told they either did not get delivered or they were stolen.  That aside the brown crust was flaking off of the plain roll, like old bread does.  The roll had already started coming apart before I could pick it up.  Need less to say it quickly didintegrated as soon as I bit in.  The pickle was limp and broken.  This a small place that could do a good lunch business I suspect if quality was better.  Oneother note, mop the floor every night and when no one is at the register send the cashier out to wipe off tables...I mean really!\nI guess I will keep looking...

<review>"""I'm not sure when the standards for Chinese food became so lax. I can remember going to so many good Chinese restaurants when I was younger, but it now it seems most every time I try a new one I'm disappointed.\n\nI hate to be so critical of Mr. Hunan--a mostly takeout joint--because the people behind the counter were very friendly, but the food was so oily and bland that it's hard to describe. I mean, it's hard to make \Hot and Sour Soup\"""" neither hot nor sour, but my try of this famous soup at Mr. Hunan revealed that it was indeed possible.  My main dish fared no better. In fact, it was so bland I've forgotten exactly what it was that I ordered! \n\nCome on, Mr. Hunan, this is the Southwest! We're not scared of some spice!!!"""""""

<review>I went strictly based on the referral of a friend. I figured her pedicure looked great, so why not?\n\nAlas, no.\n\nMy nail technician (a man) went at a much faster pace than my friend (who was sitting next to me). Ironic as I had splurged for the salt scrub. My massage was a complete waste of time. I've swatted flies harder than he did on my legs. Five bucks on the scrub was roughly 60 seconds of application, smooshing around and then a quick rinse. \n\nThe other odd thing he did was reshape my nails into round-ish shapes. I had come in with perfectly squared nails. Poof! Gone.\n\nWhen I arrived home I was dismayed to see how goopy my manicure actually was. In my opinion he used too much polish. Ugh. My manicure lasted exactly two days, at which point I removed what was left of the polish. \n\nIf you go, stay away from the man technician.

<review>Stopped by this place because my favorite spot was closed and because of I thought it was the same one as the one by ASU in Tempe. Comfortable place with traditional Thai decors. I decided to place an take out order ( because it was too late). It seemed like me and the cashier were having little difficulty placing my order, gladly the young gentleman helped me or her out with that. I hopped out without checking my order. Again, because they were about to close. But here's what drive me nut. I normally get  to go order will AT LEAST give me a set of plasticware. But yes, they didn't give me nothing. I had to have it with my bear hand ( awkward). Most importantly, my chicken dish was more likely call a soup!!! Can't even get a reAl taste of my chicken. I swear, I will only go to Thai Rama in Tempe for my hot food.
</review>
<review>I had the damndest time trying to find this place! I was supposed to go a couple weeks ago and got so frustrated I turned my car around and hung out in Tempe instead. Tonight-I was bloody determined to find it. Still got turned around, but finally-hidden behind a bunch of trees and connected some kind of sporting event sales place, there was the Willow House-damn!\n\nBeautiful stones laid out on the grass, a kind of bubbling brook (man-made) and a lot of picnic tables on the corner of McDowell and 2nd Ave, let to stairs to the actual Willow House. There were tons of options on the board but no prices (?) and the pastries, as noted, did not look that appealing. The barista I thought was pleasant and made small talk and a small chai soy latte. It came to a whopping $4.09 (!) which I was pretty surprised by, but coughed up the cash. It was actually a mix and way too sweet for me, but he did steam the soy for me pretty well.\n\nWith Soy Chai in hand, I wandered around. It is narrow at first and there all these Mexican and day of the dead kind of knick-knacks and random merchandise displayed. There is a little nook, must have been a closet, with some random vintage clothing reasonably priced and handsomely displayed there. I noted to my right was a Non-Smoking room with some people intent on laptops and older couples chatting-seemed pleasant and actually a little quiet (couldn't tell if it was a 'weird' quiet or a nice zen like quiet). I wandered more (this place is deceptively large) and ended up in a large open room with chairs and large tables where people could smoke. It opened out to a glass-enclosed narrow front room (that faced McDowell) with a high counter and some two seater and four seater tables. There were guys chatting and talking about chainsaws (I was reminded somewhat eerily of Linklater's movie Slacker). I moved away from that odd little conversation to a room with cheap LPs, some awesome 2 buck cassette tapes (Best of Bill Cosby, Guns n Roses, Heart-what!), an odd little table and interesting but somewhat amatuerish art on the walls. Unfortunately this also let me peer into a small backroom/dark kitchen (!?) with a dude making a sandwich...with his barehands. It was kind of creepy. Dream-like, really. I quickly walked away from that observation and noted never to get a sandwich here. I stumbled upon some more nooks and crannies displaying totebags and glass jewelrey before stepping out and resting at one of their picnic tables and watching the traffic on McDowell.\n\nEh.

<review>So rude, normally this is my go to delivery Chinese place, but when I called tonight the lady was a damn idiot.  First they have a min of $15 order for Togo, which I was over at 18.50 without tax, but this girl tried to tall me that it wasn't enough money, once I did the math I called back and she said she didn't realize I also ordered the rice and then continues to ask me 3 MORE TIMES if I wanted fried rice.  I'm used to the language barrier when ordering from these types of places, but really 3 times??? AND THEN, the best part, I basically told this lady she's dumb and I'm not sure if I even want to Oder from her and she HUNG UP ON ME.  I called 3 more times to speak with her boss and she kept on hanging up on me.  Never ordering from this place again.  And that stupid girl is lucky I didn't figure out her name or it'd be put on blast.  Definitely making sure these aholes don't spit in my food or try to feed me dog meat.

<review>"""My husband and I have been here once before but just for drinks and we had told ourselves we need to come back.  Well we did, on a wednesday night and sat out on the patio, lets just say....dont think we will be going back!  Our friends had joined us well and were rather excited to try the place out untill we were there for almost 3 hours and had just got drinks, apps and dinner.  The service was horrible and they werent even busy...they used every excuse possible on why the service was so bad.  We had asked the hostess to speak to a manager and instead of getting the manager she told our server who then came out asking if everything was ok and \did i do something\"""".  Finally the manager had came out and really didnt have a care in the world that we had such a bad experience.  Needless to say we will never go back there!!  Not worth the money in any way!"""""""
</review>
<review>"""My husband and I came to town to visit with some friends and we decided to try the diner. I decided that with all the up and down reviews it would probably be a fine enough place. We were greeted at the door by a very friendly gentleman who welcomed us in. It was about 1:30 in the afternoon and not very busy. That was the last of friendliness we experienced. It took about 15 minutes to be \greeted\"""" by our server. She took our drink order and left menus. After another 10 minutes our drinks came and we placed our order. I thought that so far, we had been waiting a long time and I was starting to fear the worst of the reviews creeping back into my mind.... My husband and I ordered the meatloaf with fries and a side of gravy. My friend ordered the mac and cheese and her husband a burger with extra cheese and bacon and gravy fries. Both orders of meatloaf looked very dry even with the gravy on top, the side of gravy didn't come out with meal, the mac and cheese was runny like it wasn't cooked enough or hastily thrown together. The burger was looking good but if one piece of cheese is extra cheese....... When we asked for our side of gravy and my friends husband asked about the extra cheese.... I felt like we were asking for our meal for free..... Overall..... The best experience we had was at the door by the gentleman who greeted us... The meatloaf was mediocre at best and the gravy a congealed mess and salty along with our alleged \""""fresh cut\"""" fries.... The mac and cheese was not good at all according to my friend but her husband said the burger was good and the pickle that came with it was nice and crunchy. I do think that the service staff could be better and more friendly. They were very chatty amongst themselves while the ice was melting in our drink glasses and God forbid you question what you were getting. I think we will have to pass on this place the next time for sure. Save your money too and to the gentleman who greeted us so nicely at the door, thank you! To bad the rest of the staff couldn't be more like you...."""""""

<review>It's 4th of July and nothing says Independence Day better than a hamburger (also acceptable is a hot dog). What's better is a hamburger that I don't have to cook - so I stopped by Islands for some burger-goodness. The service was very fast. I ordered a drink and within seconds it was on the table. As the drink neared its end, another appeared promptly. The glass was never empty, which being someone who is constantly thirsty, is a good sign. \n\nThe burgers now come with the endless fries. I was there previously and the fries had to be ordered separately. I found the fries to be very good. A little crunchy, but not too crunchy. The burger was a good size. I cut it in half and could only finish one half. I went with the Hula - which is a cheeseburger with Swiss, tomato and mushrooms. The burger was a little messy. It had condiments on it and the combination of condiment and grease made for a messy burger. Most guys don't really mind messy food, and I am among that list. What I didn't like was the burger was extremely salty. I assume the mushrooms were saut\u00e9ed probably in garlic salt - but I think there was a bit much. After a while, all I could taste was the salt. Good thing the drinks were endless...\n\nI don't go often to Islands. Typically I think it is okay. The service is good, but I wasn't impressed with the salty, greasy Hula burger.

<review>"""I must be one of those \chumps\"""" because I just ate here 30 minutes ago and thought it was terrible. First off, the parking situation is ridiculous. I drive a long-bed crew cab truck so it's not like I ever expect it to be easy, but WTF? They have spaces facing a wall, which are easy to get to, but then have more spaces behind those for parallel parking and there isn't room for a go kart to back up when someone uses those other spaces. \n\nWhen you go inside it smells incredible, but when you get your food it just smells like pure butter. I am not even sure why I ate my dinner. It was a mix of ingredients that just didn't work. I had a carne asada burrito, probably not their specialty, but read enough of my reviews and you see thats almost all I eat. It was almost half beans, then a bunch of guacamole, and some very tasteless meat. It was a cardboard/bean/avocado burrito. The tortilla had so much damn butter on it that it tasted like a butter stick. I'm not looking forward to seeing my cardiologist report after this. \n\nProbably the one redeeming quality I see is the little 11 year old girl that was the cashier/order taker actually spoke english. The rest of the staff were not bi-lingual, and while they don't need to be, it seems funny that the entire menu is in English. I have no problem saying carne asada, but why type \""""grilled steak\"""" on the menu if you don't want me to order it that way?"""""""

<review>"""My friend and I came here on Friday for happy hour.  It was pretty slow considering it was Friday night at 6 pm, but still had a smattering of people.  We got a seat right away and the waitress was really prompt and nice.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria on happy hour- making it only $12.50 and it was very strong!  I was bummed to see that none of the food is on happy hour specials... but priced fairly enough so not the ned of the world.  We had queso, the churros and a chopped salad.  Everything was pretty tasty and good.  Leaving on Friday, we were happy with our experience that we decided to come back on Sat night with a group of friends-- bad idea!\n\nSat night-- little line outside, but not bad.  Once we got in, it was the perfect amount of people.  Not overcrowded where you kept getting knocked into, but not so bleak that you felt like you are the only ones there.  Music was good and unique mixture of people. \n\nThe front bar was great-- got served almost immediately.  Bartender was fast, prompt and superfriendly.  Then we decided to go to the back near the pool/cabanas.  We sat at the bar and attempted to order drinks.  It was NOT packed-- there was one bartender, but that should have been adequate.  We waited patiently, and kept getting passed up.  We were there for over 10 minutes and never got acknowledged.  Finally, one of the guys we were with said (and not in a demeaning way),\ hey.... we have been here for about 10 min.\""""  The bartender proceeds to yell, \"""" Do you think I give a F**K? I don't F**king care, if you want a drink right away, then stay at home and drink there.\""""\n\nWHOA!  We were so taken aback....  she then proceeded to backtalk to the guy next to us who had ordered two straight liquor shots and got shoddy pours. \n\nWe immediately got up and left.  Walked across the street to The Lodge and drank the rest of our money away there.  \n\nI will think twice about going back to SF.  It's so sad that what would otherwise be an awesome hangout has to be tarnished by one employee who clearly didn't get the memo on customer service."""""""

<review>Tried to pop into White Chocolate Grill the other night only to find an hour and a half wait.  Should have waited!  Instead we walked across the parking lot and found a cheap seafood chain that is actually worse than Red Lobster.  Please stay away as you will only be disappointed by their failure at every turn.  The only reason for the second star was that our server was actually quite funny.  We probably should have been able to guess the quality of food we were in store for when the Mahi Mahi was $9.

<review>Are these supposed to be cupcakes, or freestanding globs of frosting and...sprinkles?\n\nI've never gone into Sprinkles, but my coworkers have brought their cupcakes in on several occasions, so I feel like its fair to review their treats.  And I'm not impressed. The cupcake part is so flimsy and weak, it practically toppled over from the four inches of frosting on top of it, each time I've picked one up. The cake tastes -- really boring. No flavor, other than some sort of weird preservative-like taste (is this from the grocery store bakery? No? Then why does it taste like it is?). I've tasted a vanilla and a chocolate and they both tasted like that.\nThe frosting is yummy, but I ended up throwing away most of it.\nThe worst part about these cupcakes is that, after eating them, both times, I've had a major, major blood sugar crash about two hours afterward. WTF? That doesn't happen when I eat other sweets... just how much sugar is in these things?

<review>"""I am new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood for someone else to cook my breakfast for a change and stumbled across all these rave reviews of Matt's on yelp. Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don't know what hole in the wall \amazing\"""" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........\n\nDon't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using \""""local\"""" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list. \n\nThe hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take \""""over easy\"""" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that's what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can't even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish. \n\nAll in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn't have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I'm sure glad I didn't for that lack of quality. There are many other options in the area, give someone else a shot that's not banking on you eating there because they were on T.V................."""""""

<review>Went last night to Whore Foods to get basics to make pizza with, most clutch to the process was a three pack of yeast. Low and behold, the dirty hippie kids they have working there again didn't put something in the bag.\n\nAnd this time it was the yeast.\n\nI love the food there, but the employees are nothing more than entitled hippie kids from Scottsdale who can't be bothered to do their goddamn jobs! I am so sick of this crap with this corporation. Maybe its a Phoenix thing, or maybe its the hiring and firing processes of Whore Foods, but I am done shopping at any Whore Foods. In a place like Phoenix, where you have alternatives such as Sprouts, you'd think Whore Foods would smarten up.\n\nOr when you try to ask someone who works here where something is, and they just walk by with their nose high in the air. I understand its important to show your fellow dirt merchants that you're a super star, but I don't work with you, I contribute to your salary and over inflated set of benefits for a grocery clerk, so do your goddamn job. Useless little girl in need of a shower and orthodontist. \n\nBut alas, Whore Foods and its dirty hippie employees have alienated yet another person with a job and a degree into hating everything that place stands for.\n\nOh yea, one other thing, take the concealed firearm prohibition off of your stores. It didn't stop Jared Loughner from doing something horrid, and all it does is alienate law abiding citizens from their Constitutional rights. I understand you think that only parts of the Constitution should apply, but honestly I think you need to pull your collective heads out of your ass and take a shower.\n\nUseless motherf* and #$@s!

<review>So, yes, it's a great location, 1 star. And a great interior, 1 star. After my 3rd visit I am officially ready to write them off my coffee list. I love supporting local businesses, but this place just isn't my cup o' jo. \nYesterday morning I went to get a latte, I ordered a small with an extra shot. The price went from $3 to $4.65, What the ....what?!? The esspresso just seemed to have a sour taste, and since I had to have my caffine, and wouldn't dare to go near the break room sludge, I forced myself to drink this. I actually wished I had gone to starbucks and I'm just not that kind of girl!!!! Maybe I am coffee spoiled, but I just couldn't palette this stuff. I am also sad they never have veggie options for breakfast burritos and they don't even carry carmel for a carmel latte?!? And the honey vanilla latte is too sweet for my taste. I am glad that some people like it, but I would rather be at Jobot or Lola's. And yes they do now except cards, but are not card friendly if you only order 1 drink.

<review>"""Three friends and I went for lunch today. I don't think we'll go back unless we hear about improvements.\n\nI had the \General Chicken\"""" lunch combo for $7.50. The hot and sour soup was so-so, but I had to add their \""""sweet sauce\"""" to make it interesting. Although the obligatory chili icon indicate this was a spicy dish, the General Tso's chicken had zero heat and very little flavor. If I had to guess, I'd say it was just colored corn syrup for sauce. The crab puffs we're big and packed... with dried, crumbled blah inside. I didn't bother eating the second one. \n\nMy friend who ordered the same dish agreed that everything was \""""eh\"""". The other two weren't impressed with their chow-mein or the Shanghai Club special.\n\nThe decor is nice: dark, comfortable atmosphere with tasteful water fountains and traditional Chinese instruments on display. The staff was great, too bad the food is weak."""""""

<review>The food is fresh and edible, but very forgettable.  I had the mango chipotle chicken salad without the shell.  Overall it was okay, but the chicken portion was very small - maybe 2.5 ounces.  The menu choices overall are hard to choose from and unless you get a salad without the shell or a single taco, the remaining choices are 700 calories plus.  A veggie burrito for example is 800 calories.  It has been awhile since I have been to Baja Fresh and I suddenly remember why. I will not be returning.

<review>i feel that indian food is pretty standard, so when you can not live up to the expectations of 'average' you must be doing something wrong.  came here for the sunday lunch buffet and it sadly was not up to snuff.  the chicken quality (both tandoori and makhani) wasn't fresh, nor was the curry tasty.  the same can be said for the mixed vegetables.  the chickpeas were good but that was really it.  even the sweet lassi was too watery (way too much ice).  overall atmosphere and location is nice; sizable space and clean, friendly staff.  but it you are looking for good food, just drive by and don't slow down.

<review>"""I've tried both Wongs and I can say with certainty that I prefer Big Wong.\n\nSince Big Wong closed, I heard that Peter Wong (her brother's place) is fairly similar but I don't think they even come close. When I arrived for dinner, I noticed the decor was very dated. They still had decoration up from the 80s. There was also a mini stage available for wedding, if anyone is interested. \n\nThere were two other parties there but no host was to be seen. It appears to me that there was only the mother/son team working the kitchen and the front of the house. So service was slow all night.\n\nWe ordered: deep-fried tofu, stuffed with shrimp; orange flavored chicken and honey walnut shrimp but I was told that they ran out of the sauce for the walnut shrimp (which was mayonnaise) so I switched that out for the roasted duck.\n\nThe deep fried tofu was missing a lot of shrimp and by a lot, I mean \stuffed\"""" was used loosely on the menu. The roasted duck was heated up in the kitchen because there were pieces that were refrigerator cold. The orange flavored chicken was missing flavor. \n\nGordon Ramsey and his Kitchen Nightmare team need to visit this place. I know the owner is a nice person and her son, looks like he hates working here and probably only doing it to help his family out."""""""

<review>I was looking for cupcakes for my son's birthday and saw that the bakers at this shop were on Ace of Cakes, so I thought I would check it out.  I went on-line and was unable to find pictures or descriptions of their cupcakes, so I called them.  The man on the phone tried to walk me through the site and then determined that there was a glitch, and so I was unable to get any information on the cupcakes.  I asked him what time they closed, and he indicated 8, so I mentioned that I would bring my son by before 8 to check out their cupcakes.  The Coffee Shop was about 25 miles away from my house, and not easy to find, but my son was very excited to test and pick out cupcakes for his party.  When I got there, before 6, they were out of cupcakes.  The girl at the counter was not friendly and when I expressed my frustration regarding trying to get info on-line, then on the phone, and finally by driving 25 miles, she simply indicated that she does not bake the cupcakes.  I did not feel like I was valued as a potential customer, and that they had no interest in trying to help me (were not able to show me pictures or flavors or cupcakes).  There are many great bakers in the valley and I prefer to hire one that is customer focused.

<review>"""First time going to Pei Wei. It is owned by PF Changs. Immaculant  and  clean restaurant. Very impressed with the quick service style ambience  and  loved the decor. I especially liked that the menu was posted on tv's on walls and at each cashier station-never seen that before. Staffed seemed unfriendly, prob bc they wanted to go home  and  celebrate 4th of July. I saw the chef  and  expeditor get in a lil argument about an order. A co-worker told them to \hush\"""". I enjoyed watching them make my order on the wok. The food was....uhhh...bleh. Got vietnamese caramel chkn  and  orange chkn and it was salty, salty, salty. Ewhh, how can ppl like this. It should be more on the sweeter side. I did like the edamame, but its always good anywhere.

<review>"""This is our first (and last) AZ Moe's experience.  We lived 3 minutes from a Moe's in Ohio and always joked about the perpetual problems that NEVER got fixed.\n\nSomehow, 2000 miles away, the problems are identical.\n1.  Tofu is offered as a \meat\"""" option but they were out of it.  The girl making the food didn't know where they kept the frozen tofu.  Same thing as Ohio.\n2.  Certain vegetables not available.  \""""I showed up today and NOBODY had done any prepwork!  Sorry!\""""  Again, same thing as Ohio.\n3.  One worker prepping food and ringing out on the register, and one worker rummaging around a freezer the entire 15 minutes they were in line (maybe looking for tofu?)  So, as the line lengthened with a Sunday lunch crowd, the poor girl became more and more frustrated.  (Yep, same as Ohio).  As I looked at my burrito sitting, getting cold, waiting for the girl to finish plating and ring it out, I just wanted to leap behind the counter and grab it.\n\nWe honestly do like Moe's food but there's some fundamental lack of management oversight to allow these problems to happen... over and over again."""""""

<review>I was absolutely starving so I looked around and saw chairs outside on a patio. When I walked up to First Watch I was a little confused. Their logo seems more like a diet organization than a restaurant in my opinion. Maybe the cafe needs to be a little larger.  \n\nI sat down with one of my friends and we ordered. I love breakfast and the omelette I ordered was not satisfying at all. The eggs seemed greasy and no one wants that when you order egg whites!  My friend took two bites of her pancakes and didnt want to eat anymore. \n\nOverall, we will not be returning!

<review>Two words, BABY ROACH..... yes I said it.. and it's true and I hate to because I've know of Macayo's in it's better days, but they've gone down hill. I've only got the steak fajitas here. Every-time I walk in seems like the front-desk is f'ing off somewhere, but at least when they show up we get seated right then. Never waited very long, 1st steak fajitas seems fine. 2nd time the steak a little undercooked, but I didn't complain (I sometimes have my steaks medium rare), 3rd time they served me all onions and no bell peppers with my steak, my Wife's meal didn't come a listed on the menu and about 10 seconds after they brought out an additional plate tortillas I saw a baby roach walking on the table. I secretly squished it (with a napkin) and never told my Wife or she would have thrown up..... We left immediately... True story.

<review>I don't like to give places a 1 star review unless I have either gotten sick or had a really bad experience. I sort of had a combination of the two at China Magic Noodle House. I saw a groupon for this restaurant a couple days ago and it looked simple and good so I went ahead and bought it. I am always in the mood for noodles so I was excited to try this place, and it was right down the street from my house. So Sunday afternoon we decided to eat here for lunch. I have been sitting on this experience for two days now and I feel that I am not giving a harsh review based on my experience. \n\nWe walk in around 3pm and there were only a few tables being served. The first thing that hits me is the smell of this place. My first thought was that it smelled like urine. I'm sure it was just a combination of the spices and whatever was being made in the kitchen, but it was not a mouth watering smell like you should experience when you walk into a restaurant. I should have turned right around and went home, but we stayed. So we sit down and someone brings over some water and some boiled peanuts and pickled vegetables. I still am not sure if this was supposed to be some kind of appetizer or a garnish for the noodles. It was a little weird. So I decided on the spicy vegetarian noodle dish, and my husband decides on the vegetables and fried noodle dish and a strawberry smoothie. I see that there are spring rolls on the menu as well. There is a language barrier here with the waiters so when I asked if the spring rolls were vegetarian at first she just thought I was ordering them, but after asking three times whether or not they were vegetarian I think she finally understood what I was asking. So I was a little bit concerned about these. \n\nEverything came out really fast. Like around 5 minutes fast. The spring rolls were vegetarian, but they tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. And the vegetables inside were really limp and not crisp at all. A couple packets of mustard and some gelatin like duck sauce come with the rolls. I didn't use either. How hard would it be to make a really simple nice sauce for the rolls? My noodles come out first and at first they look really good and I was excited. However as I am eating them I am noticing some weird textures in the supposedly vegetarian sauce. It tasted almost like some kind of seafood and it was gritty. I didn't finish it and when I asked two different waitresses what was in the sauce, neither of them could tell me. Which is concerning. I can't feel good going back to a place that can't tell me whats in the vegetarian sauce. My husband liked his noodles, but he isn't as paranoid about what his food is made out of as I am. His smoothie tasted like a slushie you get at 7-11. I am sure it was made with some kind of red dye and not fresh strawberries. Sickeningly sweet as well. \n\nAbout an hour later we are walking around Target and my stomach starts to burn. I feel this intense burning sensation in my stomach for the next two days. I think there is some kind of issue with MSG here possibly. I don't know what else could have made me feel like that. I also didn't eat pretty much anything for the next two days because of how bad my stomach felt. \n\nThe only cool thing about this place is the guy who pulls noodles in the big window in the middle of the restaurant. Prices are also pretty cheap. Its cash preferred as well. Other than that, I am sorry to say I won't be back.
</review>
<review>"""I will say that word \grocery\"""" is a tad misleading.  There is food to buy, but it's limited selection is like a cross between an expensive 7-11 and what you would find in Mario Batali's Food Network kitchen.  Plus, no one could ever need that much pasta, olive oil  and  balsamic vinegar, especially at that price.  I digress though...\n\nMy main issue was with their \""""lunch\"""" offerings.  I had an artisan pizza, and my friend a salad.  My friend self-described her salad as \""""eh...ok\"""".  My pizza was not only grossly overpriced, but it the worst pizza I've ever had.  The toppings were sparse, and didn't seem that high in quality.  Plus, it was so greasy.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have unmercifully made fun of people who blot their pizza with napkins to take grease off, but I confess I had to do it today.  The box was almost soaked thru before I even got, so you can only imagine how much was pooled on top.  It was barely edible.\n\nAfter I got back to work  and  looked at their website, they barely seem loosely affiliated with the original Oakville Grocery in Napa.  This location isn't even listed on the real Oakville Grocery website... \n\nIn the end, you can find the same products elsewhere  and  the food here is nothing to write home about, so save yourself the trouble."""""""

<review>"""I hired EcoFresh to clean 2 rugs and my formal living room couch and loveseat after our move.\n\nUnfortunately I didn't have a good experience with them and the end result is 3 cushions on the couch and loveseat are ruined. \nI called Ecofresh the day after they came to do the cleaning of my belongings to inform them that I had noticed some spots on my couch/loveseat after they cleaned and it looked like the fabric had been bleached. They sent one of their technicians out a few days later to redo the bleached areas and I ended up with blue stained cushions. I called them again to inform them of the blue stains that were now on my cushions and again they sent their same technician out again to redo the same cushions for the 3rd time. I ended up with 'bleached stained' looking cushions again. \n\nI continued my communication after 4 weeks in regards to the damaged cushions (4th call) with Ecofresh and they asked if they could come pick up the cushions and examine them at their shop.\nAfter a week without my cushions, I had to call and follow-up with Ecofresh to see what the outcome was after they took my cushions to their shop to examine and asked if I could pick them up from them, but then I was informed that they were at a different business unrelated to Ecofresh in downtown Phoenix, at 'McFarland Carpet Service'. They sent my cushions to a different business owner and he had nothing to do with my cushions.\n\n At this point I spoke with Phillip (the owner of Ecofresh) and he seemed unremorseful about this whole situation and mishap.   I informed Phillip of having a few upholstery professionals examine the spots on my couch and he indicated to me that they needed an 'ICR certification' and if they didn't have this certification that their opinion didn't matter or qualify.\n\nAfter picking up my cushions and finding out that McFarland Carpet service was NOT ICR certified and was not sure why Ecofresh brought my cushions to him, Phillip proceed to call me back and say that he was sorry and he would be refunding me my money for the cleaning service. Phillip then indicated to me that he was going to get an 'ICR certified' person for upholstery to come examine my cushions so we could find out why this happened.  I was please of this news.\n\nPhillip had Oscar from Bailey's furniture come out examine my couch. When I called Oscar to coordinate a time for him to come he indicated that he did business with Ecofresh and he was NOT \ICR\"""" certified. Oscar came out and examined my couches and indicated to me that they used the wrong product on my couches and he would let Ecofresh know the damage they had done, since they supposedly hired him to look at my furniture.\n\nAt this point it has been about 5 weeks since I began the whole process with Ecofrech. They said they were going to refund me (last week) the charges for the services and in the case the damage was their fault they would pay for it. I have not seen a check for the refund for the services and no resolution on my damaged couches.\n\n From the 2 individuals as well as Oscar from \""""Baileys Furniture\"""" (that Ecofresh hired) there is about $ 4,000 worth of damage.\n\nI would NOT recommend EcoFresh and I wish them the best of luck in their business if this is how they treat their customers."""""""

<review>I also received a personal response from Joe, the owner. He offered to return my money since we were so disappointed with our visit. Although that isn't necessary, I understand everyone's tastes and expectations are different. Being a personal chef for many years, I look for originality, depth of flavor, and complexity of seasonings. BBQ sauces have a tendency to contain too much molasses and ketchup, which makes them too sweet.\n\nWe have a BBQ place here that offers six different sauces. You get to choose which one you want, but to me, if the meat's preparation has been given a great rub, no sauce is needed.

<review>Extraordinarily ordinary.\n\nAt here on a Saturday late morning with wife and two kids.  First, there was a wait for tables, which is fine and frankly expected on the weekend at a small cafe.  But then they sat us and no waiter showed up.  Once fixed, service was really marginal for the rest of the meal.  \n\nFood was just okay.  Wife had the turkey burger, which was just very boring and not exceptionally tasty.  I had the Tryst Omelet which was reasonably priced but very underwhelming in presentation and taste.  The sweet potato tater tots sounded cool, looked cool, and tasted pretty great for the first five or six in your mouth.  But there were a LOT of plates I saw taken away with nearly full portions of the tots.\n\nKids meals were just okay.  The kids burger had a patty that tasted worse than any McDonalds or school lunch program burger I had in High School.\n\nSetting is an upscale strip mall.  Inside is pleasant.  With outdoor tables and misters, this would be a terrific late Fall through Early Spring breakfast joint if you live in the area. \n\nFood isn't terrible.  As a whole, better than a Denny's.  But really nothing exceptional at all.  And the owners were nice and friendly, but they need to teach their servers better manners and to spend less time flirting with co-workers and more time focused on taking care of the customers.\n\nI surely won't go out of my way to come back, but if I had an hour to kill for breakfast and was in the area, might give it another shot if nothing else looked better.\n\nI mean, not every place can be a Matt's Big Breakfast or St. Francis or any of the other exceptional restaurants around town, but the food, service, and atmosphere earns this place a solid 2 stars.

<review>"""We decided to eat here for our 4th anniversary dinner.  Let's start with the positives.  Beautiful decor, love the contemporary feel with the chalk blackboard  wall. Great location, the Camelback Inn is very beautiful.  The meal began with the chef's gift of  warm chicken liver spread with thyme and crusty bread - wonderfu,l followed by  the gruyere glazed popover served with a ramekin of european butter and sea salt.-amazing!  A little recipe card is included with the popovers-nice touch.   I wish I had more positives to say I really wanted to love this restaurant.\n\nSo now for the reasons for the 2 star rating.   \nWhen we arrived for our reservation, it would have been nice to have heard happy anniversary since we had noted that on our open table reservation.We were  seated in a great round booth nice intimate location for our anniversary dinner. When we arrived at our booth she  pulled the table out so we could snuggle in the back and on the seat was food.  Thankfully she noticed and I thought she would apologize and promptly clean up. What happened next should have been a warning sign of how our night was going to turn out.  She said, \Oh\"""" and stood there, so I said \""""here I'll move so you can clean that off.  She then proceeded to enter the booth and swipe the food off the seat onto the floor with her hand.  Not what I'd expect of a Laurent Tourondel restaurant. Our server arrived  promptly but still no happy anniversary.  I don't mean to make a big deal out of the lack of a greeting, it's just  a nice touch when celebrating a special occasion, definitely not a reason to give a 2 star rating though , so I'll continue.   We ordered our wine and to our surprise our server returned promptly and to our relief wished us Happy Anniversary, which quickly turned awkward as he tried to connect with us and tell us all of his friends are starting to marry and have children and now his girlfriend is looking at him wondering what his problem is that he hasn't asked her to marry him yet and how wow thats a lot of responsibility and he didn't know how people could get married blah blah blah. Thanks, you could've kept your happy anniversary.  Awkward and uncomfortable!  He then proceeded to tell us that the wine we ordered was not chilled enough and would we mind if he chilled it for 6-10 minutes.  Really, how could the wine not be chilled if it's on the menu.  Still ok at this point, we aren't high maintenace diners and honestly pretty easy going and very forgiving.  We thought at this point he would take our orders, however even though we were only 1 or 3 tables filled in the restaurant he did not return to take our order until our wine was chilled.  What he did do was help the table next to ours get that perfect photo for their memory album and blind us with the flash of their camera several times cause they weren't quite happy with their photo.  To his credit he did apologize when he returned to take our order.  \n\nI ordered the spice rubbed cowboy ribeye, my husband the bone in rib eye, a side of the creamed spinach, jalapeno mash, and hen of the woods mushrooms with a side of chimichuri and green peppercorn sauce.   The cowboy ribeye comes to the table with the whole rib attached to the ribeye not expecting that. The spices were so charred the only flavor I got was burnt and the meat itself was so fatty half the steak was totally inedible. My husband kindly shared his steak which was good, but hardly anything I would return for.  Great hen of the woods mushrooms really enjoyed these  favorite part of the dinner.  The rest of the sides ok nothing great though.  \nWe finished and my husband had to refill his own wine glass, because our server was chatting and taking pictures again. \n\n What happened next was truly shocking, something I'd expect if we were at Mcdonalds  but not a upscale steakhouse.  An electrician showed up and proceeded to change the light bulb that was out at the booth next to ours.  Mind you by this time it was 10:30 pm and the restaurant closed at 11pm.  Really are you freaking kidding me you can't wait a half hour to change a light bulb.  \n\nTo BLT'S credit they arrived  with a complimentary dessert, however as the wait staff, not our server sets it down in front of us and promptly walks away without explaining what it was we looked down and in fittingly comic horror scribbled on the plate is Happy Birthday!  WOW!!\nOur server shows to drop off the check and looks at the plate and says\"""" did they write happy birthday?  haha that's funny\""""\n\nReally BLT!  We trusted the reputation of Laurent Tourondel to schedule our special occasion and this was very amateur and embarrassing for your restaurant  at best.  When you go out to dinner and willing fork out over $200 for a meal this is not what is expected.  \nI guess my husband and I should thank BLT for giving us such a  great story to tell all of our friends and family of the night we wasted over $200 on a comical night of amateur proportion."""""""

<review>This Safeway scares me. Most of the checkers are scary, the shelves are constantly out of stock and the crazy bums that hang around the corner are annoying.\n\nWhatever renovation they did failed (although I did win an iPod). I go to this place only when absolutely necessary. The Safeway on Osborn nearly 3 miles away is a helluva lot better choice.\n\nWiFi? In a Safeway? This place manages to attract the creepiest people that sit on their laptops. They aren't sipping coffee, and I really don't want to know how they even afforded that Dell they are hunting and pecking away at.

<review>Dropped in here relatively late on a Saturday evening for a fast dinner for five, but it turned out to be nearly an all-night ordeal.  The service was just awful, what with an inexperienced waiter and staffing that did not match the number of people on a Saturday night.  Our order was simple- burgers, etc., but it took nearly a half hour to be served.  The restaurant is relatively large but only one small area was open to guests and that made it very loud and gave a crowded feeling to dinner.  When we did get our order, there was little or no  follow-up with more coffee, etc.  The evening was full of apologies and reassurances.  It may have been a fluke, but that evening, the place was not even up to  the moderate service standard at most Coco's.  The coconut custard pie was excellent, though, when it finally arrived.  I'd give them another try, I suppose, but there are lots of other places in Phoenix.

<review>After working for someone who was on their VIP list and then planning my own trips, I've realized there are definitely two levels of customer service: those who arrive at the drop off in a Mercedes and those who get dropped off by the bus.  I personally try to avoid flying in general because big crowds, undetermined schedules, and confined spaces just scream potential chaos situation, but I definitely avoid US Airways because, as a member of the non-VIP crowd, I've always experienced horrible customer service.  It is common, in the travel sector, to deal with delays and schedule changes due to weather or other issues, however, it's completely unnecessary to remind me, by your tone of voice, that I do not provide the company with enough cashflow/year to be considered important.\n\nUnless you fly first-class on a weekly basis, you won't get much customer service from them.

<review>There aren't many Mexican buffet restaurants in phoenix. Maybe because Mexican food is best served fresh. I remember the 1st time my boyfriend took me to Panchos; he remembered eating there when he was younger  and  wanted to go back.  The salsa isn't very good; it's bland for a Mexican place. We have gone back many times and I must admit that it has gotten worse  and  worse every time. The food selection has gotten worse  and  the price higher. We also saw them on the dirty dinning report  and  they got a horrible rating and neither of us was surprised. It's sad, such a great Idea  and  good location could have done allot better!
</review>
<review>I could not agree more with Alicia B's review. I went here with my husband Saturday night, it is in our nieghboorhood and we had heard decent things. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, not because it was full or busy. The hostess looked a right at us, no acknowledgement and then she went on to what must have been more important business. Finally, a passing waiter sat us. The service continued to be inattentive and slow. Our cocktails were tasty, I had a pomegranire margarita and my husband has something with a kooky name, I think it mentioned a Donkey. We had the Queso with crab which was pretty good, the crab could have been tastier and the whole thing needed some spice. The chips and salsa, OK. I had the carnitas, after recommendation by our waitress. Not bad, but certainly not good and not worth $17. My Husband has the seafood crepes, they were OK, but lacking flavor. The food was not bland, but flat, just meh. This place would be a 3 star, but for the price, it is coming down to a 2 star. \nThe building and patio are really cool and set a good atmosphere, too bad the food and service don't follow suit. \n\nOn a side note I did get to overhear a great conversation by two guys visiting from out of town, probably in thier mid to late 40s. I guess last time they came here the women were way hotter. This time there are hot women, but they are not as common. They seemed to like the place, one of them remarked the only thing better than his food was getting laid earlier that day.

<review>Was dissapointed in this last job and wasn't so impressed the first time, so my fault for going back. First, if I am paying $18 to have a simple hem done on pants, I would hope that would include them pressing the pants. Second, when I put the pants on, I am positive they didn't even hem them. I will not be taking them back for them to charge me $18 again, and will probably be doing the hem myself.

<review>"""I am furious with this place! In the past I have been a big fan of Pro Tan (other locations) as the beds tend to be newer and well maintained. But this location has got to be the worst. \n\nThe girls are snotty (which is fast becoming my biggest pet peeve - self absorbed high school girls with a minimum wage job who think they are gods gift to the world. Get a clue, honey.) \n\nBut the thing that really put this place on my sh*t list is their spray tanning. They have the Versa spa booth. A very simplified way to get a tan. You stand in four different positions and boom, done. Normally that is. \n\nThe first time I Versa tanned at this location the machine sputtered, and I could tell something was wrong. Sure enough once it had \developed\"""" it was spotty in places. I called the manager and she was nice enough and offered to let me try again. So, ok I can understand equipment error, so I dutifully scrubbed the first layer of my skin off and went back. It worked the second time, but it was a pain in the butt to have to go out of my way while on vacation. \n\nSo I'm in the area again a few months later. And, I go in for a spray tan. This time the girl at the front wants to sell me the primer, the tan, and the after moisture lock. I agreed to give it a shot, thinking \""""hey this might be new and improved\"""". But no. Now instead of just going in and having all three primer,tan, and moisture in-one, they want you to pay more money to literally learn a cheerleading routine. Back, front, side, side, back, front, side, back, front...seriously? \n\nBut I didn't even have the opportunity to finish my glorious dance routine, because after the first front, side step....the machine gurgled and died. Thats right, folks. I was standing there naked and cold with half a spray tan. Pretty much the exact thing that a person worries about when first hearing about spray tans, but which one is assured \""""never happens!\"""" \n\nTo cut my rant short, I had to get dressed, get the bimbo up front (sure enough, her words were \""""Oh it has never done this before.\"""" No sorry, no offer to fix the situation) Her best effort was to tell me she could reset it and I could try to leap in at the point where I was left off. Needless to say I told her I wanted my money back. This prompted her to have to call the manager, and finally ask for the credit card that I had paid with so she could refund the charges. At that point I asked why I couldn't just have my cash back since I hadn't paid with a credit card. It was a joke. \n\nIts a shame I won't ever be back here because the location was great for me, but by now if something annoying/shitty/ridiculous happened there it would just be shame on me for not learning my lesson."""""""

<review>This place was kind of gross. I stuck to the floor while I was at the counter ordering some food and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since they opened. This theater has only been open for about a year, but it already has a feel to it that it's been there for about 15 years and is in need of a renovation. All was well once we got inside the theater room, but the lobby/hallway was disgusting.\n\nI do like their policy of not letting small children into R-rated movies after 6PM.

<review>It's weird. I want to love Chez Nous, but I don't yet. You know how it is, it's hard to compare a copy to the original. If you've been to the now defunct location at 7th Avenue  and  Indian School, it's similar. The bouncers are friendly and just the right amount of chatty, my customized bicycle-riding photographer friends enjoy hanging about there, and the soul music will make you want to get down with your bad self on the dance floor.\n\nThe night I went, they didn't accept credit cards so that was a bit off-putting. It's not the end of the world to pay two separate ATM fees: once to get in, and then again to buy round of drinks, but it is annoying. (I've been since and was able to use a credit card at the bar but plan on a $25 minimum, an additional 20% gratuity automatically added.) I've been lucky to be able to grab a table every time I go, with no hovering. Even on a fully packed First Friday. The staff could be a little friendlier. Otherwise, it's ok.\n\nBut, all in all, it's just not the first place I want to go on a Friday night, dig?

<review>"""Booked this hotel because of a local softball tournament and the price seemed pretty good, but I should have known better.  You get what you pay for.  Our first night of three we were put in a room that had a loud air conditioning drip, the kind that gets louder and louder when you try to sleep! We drove from San Diego so we were too tired to complain.  The second night it got worse, so we did complain and they moved us to another room where they used industrial strength Febreze to cover the dirty smell of the room and it smelled like a cheap men's cologne - drenched on everything. So, after a sneezing attack and asthma onset, we moved to another room that was ten times worse.  If you have any allergies, ask them not to spray this chemical in your room.  Finally, after sitting in the lobby with all our luggage for an hour they gave us a \clean\"""" room without all the chemicals.  But, the bathroom was lacking one important amenity, no light fixtures above the sink.  Only a heat lamp over the toilet.  So, if you don't mind  not seeing yourself while shaving or putting on makeup, its an average room to say the least.  Good luck!"""""""

<review>I thought the customer service when placing my order tonight was pretty good. The guy was quick to the point and personable - no complaints there. My order was correct and on time. Kudos for that.\n\nThe food. Wow, lets talk about that. My house salad was fine, better than most pizza places that usually just give you hunks of iceberg and quartered tomatoes like they couldn't care less. My salad had baby reds, arugula, and fresh romaine. Extra points for that. The pizza, however... what happened there? The first thing we immediately noticed was that the sauce on our standard cheese pizza was extremely watery and flavorless. I have never experienced sauce so watery and it made the entire pizza a soupy mess. Despite this, we were really hungry, so I said screw it and had a slice. I wish I hadn't, because now my stomach is paying for it as we speak. \n\nI was also disappointed that the spinach that I asked for on our pizza was nothing like the spinach that I'm used to enjoying on top of their white pizza. Instead we received whole leaves of spinach that were toasted to an unenjoyable, also flavorless crisp. \n\nTo be fair, I realize that when it comes to chain restaurants some locations are better than others, and I also realize that this one just recently opened. Still, I just can't excuse a pizza (and not a very cheap one at that) that could be so bad. Hopefully things improve over the next month or so, but maybe I'll stick with the Camelback location.\n\n\nEdit: To the people (presumably employees or friends of) that are leaving fake five star reviews - stop it. It's dishonest, deceptive, and incredibly obvious.

<review>"""Hillside is doing everything right,  EXCEPT the BREAD.  I looked past it the first time.  Called it a fluke, went back tried other thing.  But this bad bread ruins a whole sandwich.  It looks like European bread, it is NOT.  Hillside needs to change bread distributors.  It could be as simple as \La Brea\"""" or even \""""Fresh and Easy's\"""" new bakery products.\n\nIt is tragic because I love everything Hillside has done; the windows the open kitchen the casual environment remind me of the greatest restaurants in town; La Grande Orange, True Food and The Vig.  I would eat here weekly if only they weren't compromising on the bread.\n\nTo the owners, I plead, get some gourmet breads, European style, herb breads, Sourdough, breads, Whole Grain with Nuts, even sprouted grain breads if you want to cater to the super healthy, but the croissant-looking, Roman Meal tasting bread should go."""""""

<review>So I'm shocked at how many stars this place has.  Don't get me wrong.  It is GREAT for kids.  They love all the toppings, it's relatively cheap, the place is clean, and they even have strawberries floating around in the self-serve water cooler. \n\nAs far as taste goes, I can no longer put anything in my cup that doesn't have the word 'tart' after it.  The banana yogurt has the same flavor as that Wacky Taffy crap. . . not banana, but candy flavored fake banana.  The pistachio doesn't taste anything like a pistachio. My three year old will no longer touch it.  Even the chocolate is bad.  Both my husband and I have commented to each other that some of the flavors have a chemical aftertaste.  If you are looking for quality yogurt or ice cream, skip this place.  If you're looking for toppings and a fun time for kids, well, then by all means.  Have at it!

<review>"""this place was a horrible experience all the way from the customer service to the coffee. i went here about 3 weeks ago with two of my friends who also were first time customer's, im not sure where to begin, its small, crowded, with uncomfortable furniture. all 3 of us got something different, my coffee was nothing but a cup of iced milk with sugar on top, and my 2 friends cups tasted like burnt coffee beans, yuk, when we waited in line for about 15min and reached the counter we had no greeting from the woman behind the couter with the fake english accent, she just said \what do you want?\"""" i asked what their most popular drink was and she sighed as if i was an inconvience...wow.... we barly paid and got the drinks then noticed the awful taste... i walked back to the counter to ask if this was the correct drink and that it didnt taste like there was any flavor or coffee, instead of apologizing and re-making me a new one the woman responded \""""thats the way we make it\""""    again wow... so at that point we threw are full cups in the trash and walked out, never again will i back - i recently found out lux was owned by someon else previously and then the owner sold it to open a coffee bar and resturant called \""""lola's\"""" -- im sure its was 10x better when the prevously owner had it because i just went to lola's 3 days ago and let me tell you the best coffee and the best service i was looking for, so if you don't like lux go to lola's ...... lux rhymes with sux"""""""

<review>"""A warm greeting means alot, but if that's the best part of one's take out experience, the establishment probably doesnt warrant four or five stars.  Portions are solid and prices fair, but there are a number of things Karey's could improve on. \n\nFirst, the signature dishes we tried didnt have much wow factor at all.   The cute little lumpia are like Sharon Stone in 'Basic Instinct'. Blonde and delicious on the outside, dark and horrible within. The pork paste, or whatever it is, might as well be dog food. Sorry, but that's my honest opinion.  The authentic, custardy cassava cake was different (yay!) and cheap(yay!), but quite mild for a dessert, at least to my undiscerning, sugar-addled taste.   \n\nOur chicken sample was dry, the pork adobo and beef offered were better - the texture of the slow cooked beef reminded me of my mother's Yankee pot roast - only this had less flavor and seasoning.  My unadventerous teen said his beef burrito was one of the worst meals he's had in a while...not much juicy meat taste and a ridiculous amount of cheese which overpowered everything.  \n\nSecond, the free samples are fun and appreciated but the context in which they're provided is a little awkward.  When we walked in, all the steamtrays were covered and there were no pictures of the food - at least not that I remember. Maybe there's a culinary reason for the covers, but you cant SEE or really SMELL any food!  So you're kind of at Karen's \mercy\"""" to provide you with these toothpick samples.  She cheerfully offered three mainstays (chicken, beef, pork)...and then there was this sort of lull, where I guess we were supposed to \""""decide\"""", despite a blackboard off to the side, listing four or five addtl specialties.   \n\nIt's partly my fault. I asked about pancit and dropped a hint or two that I wanted to try a variety, but couldve been more forceful probing options.  By this time, however, we had already eaten six skewers and I felt a little piggish asking for more. And Karen didnt offer more. Were we hard sold something we didnt want? No.  But I felt gently steered toward a few standard selections and away from other (more exotic?) options, especially considering there was nobody behind us in line.  If the covers were off, or there were pictures, I'd have been more likely to say, \""""That looks interesting\"""" or \""""that smells good, what's that?\"""".   In lieu of a detailed, descriptive menu (there is none, although Karen was verbally descriptive and very helpful) I just think a customer benefits most from a visual display (think Miracle Mile Deli, Panda Express, etc) of ready to eat fare.     \n\nWe stopped by around 5:30pm on a Thursday, and were at Karey's around  fifteen minutes.  There were no other customers.  Zero.  Tons of traffic driving home from work. And nobody.   At this point, I think Karey's is a more sincere than genuinely  savvy operation, but that could change by smoothing a few rough edges,  showcasing all their recipes and maybe a spicier sauce or two.  \n\nTwo minor glitches.  We werent given a receipt copy for our take out order. Also, one of our plastic clamshells leaked on the way home.   The sauce was filled near the brim, but it was messy and annoying.  Good intentions...not so good execution.    \n\nThere's definitely potential here and they're not too far from making this a terrific place with broad appeal.  Who wouldnt root for a relatively unfamiliar cuisine served up by such friendly folks?   But I think (for well intentioned Yelpers) to pretend they've already nailed it, largely on the strength of warm greetings and surprisingly mild fare with exotic names, may be setting Karey's up for a wave of unmet expectations. I know that's how we felt."""""""

<review>Opened up a checking account several weeks ago. The card I received had my name spelled wrong which was an error I probably wouldnt have noticed until they called me a day later. I went back to the branch where they offered me a gift card for my troubles in hope that the experience didnt leave a bad taste in my mouth. Well, I went to use the gift card (no activation required) and it declined saying there was no amount on the card. So I thought eh, I'll try it some other time. Well tried it again and still does not have a balance. I emailed customer service over a week ago and still havent heard back.
</review>
<review>Awkward set up that is messy and unorganized. It's one of those places where you are not sure what to do or where to stand or where to get your food and coffee - and they don't care. They are trying so hard to be hipster and cool that they forgot about customer service. They just need to re-think they way they operate, and I think they would rock, since the coffee is very good. The food is just average, however. My biggest complaint is that there is one dark haired short girl that works there that just seems out of it and rude. She does't look at you when you order, and then end up making you repeat yourself several times. Also - she's not very polite. Maybe I just wasn't hipster enough for her. \n\nI think most people go here b/c of the hype and to scope out others... If you don't feel like getting looked up and down while you drink your coffee, don't go here. Lola or Urban Beans are much better.

<review>"""BEWARE THE EXPENSIVE, UNWARRANTED UPCHARGE--NOT WORTH IT!\n\nBack in my college days, I would frequent Einstein Bros often. Inexpensive food when you're on the go. On my way to work this morning, I decided to revisit my once-frequented bagel go-to. At first I was glad to see their \Healthy Options\"""" menu, featuring the asparagus mushroom and swiss bagel thin, which is what I ordered. I requested the swiss be replaced by cream cheese. The clerk asked if I wouldn't mind a \""""70 cent\"""" upcharge. Immediately I think this strange that I get charged additionally for one cheese over another, but I'm in a rush and not overly worried about 70 cents. When another clerk rings me up, the bill was $1.50 more than I expected. Yes, they charged me $1.50 extra for cream cheese. I inquired as to why the incredibly high upcharge, to which the clerk curtly replies, \""""sorry.\"""" When my sandwich finally arrived (the other issue was the incredibly long time it took to place the order, another long wait to pay, and yet another long wait to receive the bagel--interestingly enough there were only a few other people in the store), the asparagus was ice cold and the bagel hardly toasted. All in all, this was a bad enough experience to never revisit this or any other Einstein Bros location."""""""

<review>"""If I could give this place a negative star, I would. It is where I shop for groceries, but I detest it every time I go. The only time it isn't busy with bus people and 19th Ave riff-raff (yes, I am being snarky and elitist, but I don't care!!!) is Saturday or Sunday mornings, anytime before 10 a.m. All that roam the isles at this time are nice, older people from the nearby retirement communities. I guess the stink of the city aren't quite up at that time. \n\nI once saw a man with a huge gash on his nose with blood dried up all over it.  I looked at him oddly, and he gave me a look back, like \hey, what are you lookin' at?!\"""" Ummmm... hello!  Plus it smells in there -- not a good attribute to have at grocery store -- and, it is nearly impossible to find a grocery cart or a nice check-out person.\n\nDespite all these unbearable flaws, I know I'll keep going.  I am a sucker for cheap prices!  Just remember: Before 10 a.m. + old people = good shopping experience; 5 p.m. on a Tuesday night (or any night for that matter) + weirdos = scary shopping experience.\n\nUpdate 2.2 - I feel a little bad about giving this Fry's only one star, especially since I shop there.  So, I'll give it at least two for some of its redeemable qualities.  However, today I got there early to do a little shopping, and it was fairly quiet with no lingering pee smell, but I still get aggravated by that store!  \n\nTheir Roma tomatoes were awful looking. I saw a produce stocker accidentally push a red bell pepper onto the floor and then picked it up, dust it off and put it back!  They failed to stock their frozen pizzas, which left me with about two options to choose from. And, they NEVER have any baggers.  My poor cashier had to bag everything.  \n\nOh, and to top it off, whenever I go there I have really bad cart karma.  I always pick a shitty one, I swear!  I really think I am going to buck it up and head to Safeway.  They always smile and say \""""Good Morning.\"""" I think that alone is worth a few extra bucks!"""""""

<review>Brunch was one of the worst experienced. over-priced ($18 per person) and just off. a mimosa served in a tumbler filled with ice? lame. mimosas come in a flute, period. Euro- styled pancake was thin chewy and better off as a frisbee. Mexican scramble on tortillas was disappointing. I was hoping for something resembling huevos rancheros but was left with dry scrambled eggs on dry tortillas. the cheese was mildly flavored and the salsa did have a kick but not enough to make the dish. never again. this place while trying to be different failed. top it off, the waitress was annoying and ditzy. meanwhile, Scramble next door had a long line almost out the door.

<review>The ONLY reason to go here is for the chefs who cook at your table (if you sit at the right tables).  The chefs are entertaining and put on a good show.   However, everything else here SUCKS.  The building is a strange slanted roof/huge ceiling building that looks like it used to be a church or ski lodge or something.  The service is bad and even thought he chefs are good, the food is mediocre.  The worst part of this place by far though is that there is no air coniditioning!!! It's hot as hell in this place.

<review>"""My wife and I met there for lunch. We started with an order of fried pickles which were horrible. The batter was grainy like it consisted only of cornmeal. We each ordered fish tacos which arrived luke warm. Our waiter was running all over the place and seemed really behind...this would explain why our food arrived late. The fish was heavily battered and heavily deep fried.....like a big, greasy sponge. I know some of you are thinking \why did this guy go to a wings place and get fish tacos\"""". Well folks, once I got a look at their wings I decided the fish tacos were probably a safer bet. I make delicious fish tacos at home and figured they couldn't screw them up.

<review>On May 4, 2012, while on vacation, I had a pedicure with Christine who injured me by removing live skin. A deep wound quickly formed and became infected, causing great and constant pain and making walking almost impossible. At the time, the doctor came to look at the injury and advised against using topical antibiotic.\nNow 3 weeks later the wound remains unhealed and the pain remains severe so that walking is extremely difficult.\nI've called several times and the first time the doctor called me back. I've requested a refund and only received one for the tip. I have seen a doctor since returning to DC who is treating the infection.\nWhat was to have been a relaxing hour was instead and remains a painful experience.

<review>This salad bar restaurant is okay. I can't even stress to people enough though that this is on the polar opposite end of Sweet Tomatoes both in quality of food and selection and they are about the same price. The selection here is a lot smaller and you can tell that the quality of produce isn't as high. Also, the bread selection looks like something that they just pulled out of the freezer. I will eat here on occasion with colleagues if we really want a salad bar lunch.

<review>"""Read the reviews on Yelp tonite and decided to give Arriba's a whirl.  We went to the Camelback location.  The place was OK.  Nothing stupendous and nothing God awful either.  The whole place looked pretty grungy, in particular there was trash all over the floors; bits of paper, wrappers, gum and such. \n\nThe service was \meh\"""".  After we were seated a highly disinterested bus person or food runner dropped off a heaping wrought iron edifice of greasy, pretty tasteless chips.  They actually tasted more like cereal than tortilla chips. She also sloughed off extra ramekins of bland, but spicy bean dip and salsa.  She kinda dropped the stuff on the table and withdrew quickly as if she were throwing a diaper into the trash.  Our server barely spoke English and barely seemed to notice we were there.  She seemed either aloof or afraid to speak, which I guess was her personal rendition of subservience or something.\n\nThe BF and I both wanted to try the White Sands Chimi after all the awesome reviews on Yelp, so we agreed that he'd get it, give me a bite and I ordered the Arriba sampler, which was like 8 appetizer sized chucks of really greazy, indistinguishable and pretty tasteless finger foods.  He ordered guacamole with his and I asked for sour creme with mine.  His guacamole did not come out on his plate or on the side, but we were charged $2.50 for it.  I did get \""""sour creme\"""" but it was more of a frozen glop of dairy than anything else.  The White Sands Chimi seemed like it would have a good flavor but I couldn't really savor it because the intense burning was too much to endure. The BF  and  I literally swapped plates halfway thru the meal b/c he couldn't take the heat of the chilies anymore.  I really don't think they're hatch chilies. They burned like jalape\u00f1o.  I buy roasted hatch chilies fresh-roasted at Food City all the time and they do not burn the crap outta your tongue like this food did.\n\nOur server never came back to check on the food, our drinks, bring more water or soda and I literally had to flag her down to ask for the check.  It was NOT busy in there at all and I saw about 5 other servers buzzing about serving the maybe 10 tables total that were seated in the whole place.\n\nAll in all -- nothing overwhelming, including the food. It just all tasted like overly greazy fried corn chips that had been in a half empty cereal box for 6 months.  Other than \""""spicy\"""" -- there were no particularly memorable or enjoyable flavors.  I don't think that just burning my (I suppose wuss-assed, from other people's reviews) tongue on bland fried foods is authentic Mexican.\n\nThere were some people hootin' it up in the bar. I guess if you like Big Gulp-sized margaritas, this place might be cool. Doubt I'll return.  The BF liked it though, so who knows. Maybe it was just an off night for me.  The desserts did look amazing so maybe some other time we'll check it out for sweets."""""""

<review>Bottom line, the service is the worst I've experienced in Casa Grande!  We've been there several times since the opening approximately 3 years ago and have been disappointed everytime.  Our feeling was, it can only improve right?  Wrong!  As of Friday evening have made the descision not to go back to this location.  Met friends and sat over 30 minutes with an empty drink glass,  not offered food, no chips were brought to the table until we asked, and had to ask if we could order an appetizer!!  What is wrong with this picture??  When you actually get the food, it is okay, can get better at the taco stand in the parking lot at Big Lots...  The only thing I can say good about this place is the aesthetics of the place and it appears to be clean.

<review>"""I need to preface this review with one statement. \n\nI used to love the food. I used to be a regular here and told just about anyone that would listen how good it was.\n\nHere is the bad. I was eating lunch here one day and broke a tooth on a bone or large piece gristle. I was not just a chipped tooth, but an actual break. I informed Dan Maldonado, the owner, before I left. He was seemed genuinely concerned and cooperative.  I went directly to the dentist and was informed it would need  a crown.  A few days later I went to Tacos Atoyac to discuss this with Dan . He was the exact opposite and informed me that his cousin was a lawyer (big deal) and that it was up to me to prove it happened there. Well, I gave Dan the benefit of the doubt and let him know I was not there to shake him down. Really, all I wanted was an apology and a little help with the dental costs, which amounted to over $1,000. I left my card and waited a couple of weeks for a call.\n I never expected him to cover all of it, or even half of it. I was looking for a little acknowledgement.  I never got it. I stopped by a couple of times and Dan was either \not there\"""" or too busy to talk. I expected more courtesy. To his credit, he offered to buy my burrito the last time I was there. Unfortunately,  it was was weak attempt to make amends. I did not accept, because this was never about money. \n\nAs far as the food, make your own choice, but be careful. It could cost you more than $4.00 and the owner could care less about the repercussions to his customers."""""""

First of all I got there and all went ok  at the desk then they sent me to get my car , a Versa, and when I get to the gate to leave the teller tells me the Id # is wrong. so back up and go to the window and find out whats wrong. Dodo in the lot tells me the car I need is a Buick.  I have to put the car back and go to the window and she tells me the paper work is wrong and she has to print up a new ticket. The car I just parked is the car I'm supposed to have. So i have to walk and get the right car again. Then I only drove to my friends home in Scottsdale parked and never drove the car again til I came back to the rental. I was super late and the gas needle never even moved yet they said I used 2 1/2 gallons of gas to drive 84 miles in a versa??? Really , the asshole who took the car from me probably put a gallon in his car and 1 in mine.  Never Budget again.

<review>Not as nice as I was expecting... Hotel was at low occupancy and we got a room overlooking a parking lot.  The waterslide pool during the day was nice and not too crowded.    The rooms are sizable and the beds comfortable.The family pool at night was loud and crowded.  Internet was for one computer only... Nickel and dimed.. Even cost $ for the Gym.  Sad when a family goes to have a well deserved break at a place they imagine to be relaxing and it's just more stressful at the end of the day.
</review>
<review>In Short...Decent Atmosphere, Average overall food Quality...WAAYYY Too Expensive.\n\nFor a place famous for it's steaks and ribs I was sorely disappointed. I was with a group of about 7 people. The Big Hamburger that was ordered medium by one person in my party came well done and dry as the desert. The initial helping of all you can eat beef ribs was pretty good...if a little too saucy...with the meat falling off the bone. but the additional helpings were AWFUL!!! TERRIBLY under cooked and had to order 2 additional helpings just to get 3 bites of edible meat...the second helping didn't even appear to have been cooked and I had to fight to get 3 bites off of EIGHT Ribs....Just Awful.\n\nThe Outback, Texas Roadhouse and Saltgrass Steakhouse are less expensive and provide much better fare. \n\nThe atmosphere is country western with a band that plays occasionally and virtually all the staff we dealt with were friendly and accommodating. If only the food was better I might have been abe to give this place 3 maybe even 4 stars, but it is a restaurant after all...so good food should be the focus

<review>"""I don't know if this place has gone downhill since the last reviews or if the people involved are used to lack luster \authentic\"""" Mexican food. Party of two last night, just me and the wife yet it took the staff at least 10 minutes to set our table with menus and ask us about our drink of choice. (- 1 star) I ordered a #12 (Red chili burro, taco, R  and  B) and my wife ordered the Carne Asada plate. The food prep took 40 minutes to get to our table (-1 star), and the only exciting thing was watching the tables next to us get food in 15 minute intervals and by the time one table is finished eating the next received their food. My red chili burro had tough meat and the sauce was clearly out of a can and the wifes Carne Asade was far from par it was a tough double bogey. (-1 star) The place was packed so I gave them some slack but when the waitress says they are out of ice while another is putting ice in a pitcher that's where I draw the line. Horrible service from the majority of servers, with only one working hard (-1 star). Nothing like waiting 10 minutes for a refill or more chips, and the whole dinner for two was nearly 1.5 hours long for a hole in the wall cafe. I normally gives places a second shot, but it's a slap in the face to a real good authentic place in other parts of the valley I.E. Pedro's in Glendale, or Rita's off 43rd ave and the I-10.

We were there for the lunch rush and there were only 3 waitresses to the whole place.  Maybe someone was sick - I'll give them that much. We were able to get a table right away and waited about 10 minutes before a waitress came to take our order.

<review>The food here was decent, but nothing to write home about. The tortilla soup had a nice spicy kick. The ahi tuna appetizer was pretty good, I had that as my main dish. My fellow diners were also satisfied with their orders. The one dish I didn't think was very good was the green chili mac and cheese side. It tasted like velveeta instant mac  and  cheese with a little green chili added.  If I was only rating the food, this place would probably get 3 stars but I had some issues with the service and ambience.\n\nOur party was seated towards the back of the restaurant near a back door, which servers used to go in and out to get more chairs. This happened at least 3 times during our meal, which was an issue since the temp was down to about 50 degrees that night. The service was also not great, for example, we asked for more bread and it was never brought out. \n\nAll in all, decent food but nothing special.
</review>
<review>Not the type of restaurant I was expecting.  Order and seat yourself style.\n\nPrices are low.  Taste is very bland - no spices, no seasoning.  VERY AMERICAN, no real Mexican flavor to it.  Boring!  Salsa bar is a great idea, but even that has no flavor.  The hot salsa was more of a mild flavor.\n\nCustomer service is amazing though! Never had to get up to fill up my drink, constantly asking you if you need anything too.\n\nI probably wouldn't come here again, although I am glad I tried it, I would prefer to go somewhere with a little more flavor.

<review>"""First of all, please forgive. I have been AWOL for the past...months!!! So many changes in my life have happened--mainly the \career\"""" aspect of it--that I haven't had the chance to catch up with the \""""social\"""" aspect. \n\nOkay, I jest...I've been going to happy hours left and right that I haven't had time to even write a single review for the past few months. Hey, at least I know that the first step is acknowledgement that I have a slight problem.\n\nAnyway, I work in downtown Phoenix now...and let me start off my new batch of reviews with the NASTY.\n\nHere it is in a nutshell...101 Bistro is a waste of precious, precious real estate! From what I've heard, this restaurant has re-incarnated itself a few times, and each time, the owners can't seem to get it right. \n\nIt was lunch time and this sheltered suburbanite decided to step into what seemed like a very cool place from the outside. 101 Bistro has a corner, sidewalk patio where you know want to be seen with your patent leather high-heeled shoes, your Chloe Paddington bag (the fake one, of course), and maybe your pouffy, yappy dog, while sipping tea and munching on the most decadent chocolatey cheesecake. Well, I didn't possess any of those that day, so I opted for a table inside where the lunch atmosphere was the typical \""""blue-tied gentlemen and women in ubiquitous polyester suits (not that there's anything wrong with polyester)\"""" all intently examining the mysterious brown leather-bound portfolio, acting as if they have some top secret shit in their hands. You know the kinds.\n\nAnyway, my lonely self found a corner table and began looking at their lunch menu that is supposed to be served fast enough to get you back in the office on time. I decided on the gyro--with slices of meat, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, onion and then drizzled with a Mediterranean yogurt sauce wrapped in a fresh, warm pita bread (is that what you call the bread?). Oh it was served super fast alright, too fast that the warm pita bread was not at all warm and the thin slices of meat could use a little more nuking (oh please don't tell me that they only grill their meats...if you have to serve it quick, I'm sure you nuke it). The meat also needed more seasonings (Mediterranean seasonings preferably). Ooooh, and that yogurt sauce drizzled over it? Water-y and bland.\n\nSo, my lonely self was forced to never let go of the pepper shaker throughout my dining experience and peppered that crap out of that gyro just to give my taste buds some kind of sensation and pleasure. Then I had a thought! Maybe...just maybe...I should order some kind of dessert to make my lonely self feel all better deep inside. But alas, I looked at their refrigerated display case where their desserts are housed, and sad to report, I couldn't really see inside because of the major condensation on the glass! Their frickin refrigerated display case was not working up to par; there was a pool of water on the floor (meaning: the ice is melting); and there are rounds and rounds of cheesecake and other dairy-filled goodies in there waiting to be saved!!! IN THE SUMMER HEAT!!! Uhhh...I don't know about you but, improperly refrigerated dairy desserts in the Arizona heat is a no-no to me.\nSadness filled my heart for 101 Bistro. It has the potential to become the hip happening lunch place to be seen, especially when the light rail is up and running. \n\nBut hey, the service was fast...so fast that they forgot to give me my iced tea (until I realized that I was choking on the bland gyro) and my eating utensils (until I realized that I needed a fork and a napkin to wipe off the watery yogurt sauce dribbling down my chin). \n\nSad!"""""""

<review>"""The saying, \Don't go away mad, just go away\"""" comes to mind. Having dined here several times I concluded it wouldn't even be worth a complaint to mgmt. Regulars at this location seem just too blissfully ignorant.\n\nHints: P.F Changs food is supposed to taste good. It's a chain that attracts people who know how to appear in public, don't wish they were at the beer garden instead, and have already learned how to feed infants in public. Tipping them upside down and shoving a bottle in the mouth while they squirm makes you look retarded.\n\nIf the thought of any of the above interests you, go for it."""""""

<review>I have been to Alice Cooperstown MANY times over the years but it was the most recent experience that made me think back to all those times and wonder why it is I keep coming back? \n\nThe food is bland. I don't know how much simplier I can be. The Big Unit--Bland. The Ryne Sandburger--Bland. French Fries---DOUBLE bland. Onion Rings---Bland. The BBQ dipping dauce for the onion rings--BLAND. There is absolutely NO FLAVOR to this food! Thank God for ketchup and mustard cuz otherwise it would have been your basic hosptial food. And every other time I've gone here, it's been bland bland bland food. Nothing pops at this restaurant when it comes to the food. And the drinks...blah at best. I once ordered a Waborita and had to send it back three because it was so watered down. You'd have to spend a lot of money to get a buzz on at this place because the drinks are very watered down. The beers are crisp and fresh, but the drinks..not so much. \n\nNow if you are looking for ATMOSPHERE, Cooperstown is your place.  The staff all have the Alice Cooper-esque eye-liner which is cool. There is Alice memoribilia covering every inch of every wall in the place. And of course all good theme restaurants have a gift shop.  They have great live bands that come out to play and when there is no band, they have great piped in music too.  \n\nCooperstown is a novel place to take out-of-town guests before a game, but if it's just you and your family, you won't feel empty if you skip it.  It's just too much money to spend on very bland, uneventful food.

<review>So, I take my daughter to the MMR Aquatic Center for her final paperwork to become Scottsdales Next Greatest Public Pool Lifeguard and I arrive with barely enough gas to go another mile.\n\nFortunately, this shell is right around the corner.  Unfortunately, the premium gasoline is uber-expensive at $4.39 per gallon.  I have no choice, so I just put in a few gallons - not that I couldn't fill it, but I couldn't get past this price knowing also that Royal Dutch Shell is reporting greater profits than ever before.\n\napart from that, the station is big, open, plenty of pumps and easy to get to and as with most, offers a convenience store so I can go inside and get a bottle of tea to sooth my frustration.\n\nReally?  I better stop before I start ranting about gas prices.  I don't live in this neighborhood, but if I did, I'd be going to Costco for my gas.   just sayin.

<review>First off dessert and wine were great. Went there with a group of five. Had drinks, dinner and dessert. Shared the creme brulee and red velvet cupcake. But two of us also shared a bout of violent food poisoning. Although we didnt eat the same thing we both were spewing not much later and one of us even took a trip to the ER. Not a clue what was contaminated that made us both sick. Maybe it was the edamame, who knows. But for sure, will not be going back.
</review>
<review>Ehhh. Food was okay. None of us were really impressed with our meal. It was overpriced for what it was. The atmosphere was trendy, but it didn't make up for the fact that my sandwich tasted like crap. The drinks are expensive. My sangria tasted like a newbie attempted to make it. Ugh. This place is LOUD. Good luck having a conversation at a normal level. At least we looked cool sitting in the booth...but we won't be going back.

<review>"""My boyfriend and I were on a date. We had made plans to go watch a move at the iPic for the first time. Being it Scottsdale and a nice area, we decided to have dinner at Tanzy first, (yuck), and then decided to give Salt a try since we were early for the movie. We sat in the lounge area. We were greeted by some guy, no name, nothing, just gave us a menu. And then asked us what we wanted for drinks. We decided since our cocktails at Tanzy were gross, we thought it might be better at Salt. Um no, their cocktails/specialty drinks were just as gross. I ordered the Arizona Rita, so gross! it didn't taste like any alcohol in it. It tasted really sour fruit puree! My boyfriend had a bad experience with the cocktails at Tanzy before we went to Salt so he just ordered a kilt lifter. We finally got our bill, paid and left it on the table, then headed to the movie! As were were handing our tickets over to the ticket guy at iPic, a black guy who was the bartender came running towards us and told us we had to go up to the bar and pay for our drinks. I was really caught off guard and got a little confused and angry because we had left the money with the bill at the table that we were sitting at.  We told him we had already paid and the money was on the table. My boyfriend and I got very angry with what just happened but didn't retaliate. We thought he was very rude to come running at us and yelling at us saying we had to go to the bar and pay our tab. The black bartender told us \Hey you guys need to go to the bar and pay your tab.\"""" How rude!!? He didn't even check the table to see we had already paid the tab, he just assumed that we were running out on the tab and came chasing after us. Before he accuses us of not paying, he should have checked the table to see we had paid, and we even left a generous tip. That bartender was very rude! I'm pretty sure if someone was going to walk out on their tab, theyd probbaly be running and heading straight for the exit. We were just about to walk into iPic and enjoy a movie date together. Service at salt sucks! They need to hire nice bartenders and servers who know how to provide good customer service and not bartenders who are rude and accuse guests of walking out on their tab. \n\nI'm very disappointed in this place, service and bartenders are rude!"""""""

<review>Damn. Pierre's review of the health code violations brought this from a five to a one. ICK ICK ICK ICK ICK!!!\n\nSouthern style Indian food- ALL VEGETARIAN AND VEGAN!!!!\n\nAfter having a few games of Buckhunt at the Stray Cat (and perhaps a pitcher of Miller High Life...I won't front), my companion and I decided we were hungry. Not wanting to resort to Four Peaks in Tempe for food, he suggested Green restaurant-finally! A Flexatarian (def. someone who enjoys not eating meat at every meal and understands that a person may not eat meat and still like food) who understood my lactose-intolerance wasn't just to be difficult!\n\nSo we stopped by Green..and they are closed on Sundays. Damn.\n\nWe drive down Scottsdale road, saddened by the rainy Sunday night, and he spots this Indian restaurant. I pictures creamy paneers and chickeny kormas...uh-uh folks. All vegetarian and vegan!\n\nWe are welcomed warmly to a full house and realize quickly we are the only white people there (SCORE!). I order us the appetizer sampler-WHICH IS HUGE. I mean, it had four sauces (the cilantro, coconut, tamarind..and some kind of chutney), pakoras, samosas, lentils, etc. We ended up cutting them all in half and taking them home. I had the Dosai with potatos, onions, chutney, peas and spices and loved it. I love tamarind sauce and I think the staff was please I did cause they give me a shitload. He ordered a kind of dosai with cheese in it and it tasted yummy..but eerily like an enchilda. I also convinced him to indulge in the mango lassi (god, I miss those dairy yogurty drinks) and it was tasty-not that sweet and maybe a bit yogurty than necessary, but really cooled down the mouth when had too much of the spicy chutney.\n\nThe bathroom was nice, the staff was great, the decor was simply, all the Indian families were happy, I was happy, he was happy, and I had about 100 vegan items to choose from. Why the hell did I wait so long to go here?!? Please check it out!

<review>Tried this place tonight,   I had the fried flounder, originally ordered tilapia but after  placing the order was told they were out. The teenager  working there, was extremely shy, and  difficult to hear what he was saying. My dining compadre had the chicken inasal. The fish was fried perfectly but very small, no side veggies.  The chicken was simply grilled,  but too pink for me.  Never was checked on again by waiter, not offered more tea, or coke. Had to flag him down to get a splenda. It was not busy in there and food took 35 mins to get out then had to flag him down again to get the check.  No excuse to ignore patrons.
</review>
<review>We have mostly had good experiences here but last night was so awful so here's my review. \n\nTwo $7 margaritas and I walked out completely sober. (Tried two different ones even!)\n\nThe waitress, Amber, tried to explain to me some frat bullshit she was told about having a drink that was cold, sweet, and sour and how you therefore don't taste the alcohol. I am usually toast after a half of one of the Top Shelf margaritas...and no joke, I could have passed any field sobriety test.\n\nShe was an awful waitress to begin with - although not intentionally - she just seemed to be way over her head and have some sort of short term memory problem.\n\nShe did however do what she could to make sure we left barely happy - but still charging me for $7 margaritas that I disliked was crap.\n\nWe are done with that place and that will be absolutely the last time we go back.
</review>
<review>Come on?  Really?  Just because Oprah thinks there great, does not make them so!  Mine are better and they come out of a box and you don't have to wait in line for an hour! \n\nI visited Cupcakes at there Beverly Hills store and thought they were ok - but nothing to write home about - in fact, they weren't moist enough!\n\nWhen I saw the one that opened near Fashion Square all that came to mind was really?  Why?  And how the hell can there pay the rent selling cupcakes!?!  Hey, I am not hatin' just asking!

<review>$25 per checked bag and lukewarm bottled filtered tap water from Vegas to Phoenix?  If my company hadn't flown and paid for me, I'd have been very displeased. I understand it's an hour long flight, but even Southwest serves snacks and beverages on flights that long (and your first TWO bags are FREE).  Very unimpressive experience.  Boarding and stowing would be so much less an issue if you didn't charge for EVERY bag.  People might check theirs.  The only thing that got this two stars instead of one, was that we didn't fall out of the sky and I will hand it to the pilot on the return flight, as we flew through a gusty wind storm and though very choppy, he landed us very well.

<review>This is the second time I have been to this new Jimmy John's location.  I thought the first time I went there maybe they were still new and that's why my beach club was missing sprouts...not the case.  Today I ordered a beach club -unwich (hold the bread) and again no sprouts, or really much of anything.. so glad I paid $7.00 for lettuce a slice of turkey and tomatoes...my receipt says beach club...which according to the menu (and every other Jimmy John's I've been to) includes: turkey, cheese,avocado spread, sliced cucumbers, sprouts, lettuce, tomato and mayo.. eh, look at the picture and tell me what you see.  On top of that.. it was definitely not fast and no one was freakin'..more like we were all waiting around wondering when we were gonna get our overpriced, not as advertised sandwich.

<review>The first time I had met Ryan was at the East Valley Bridal Show and I liked what I saw of his designs. They seemed very creative and well priced, not to mention I had $10 off my order from a prize wheel.\n\nWhen I was ready to start my invitations I called and left a message with the owner for Ryan to call me back...nothing. A week later I called him back and he was out, when he finally did get back to me I set a time that I was going to come in and discuss the design I was hoping to get. Upon meeting him he made me feel like he could practically design anything I wanted...WRONG! First of all he gave me a day to expect a proof from him and...nothing! (noticing a pattern?) I had to call him and track down my proof, when I finally did receive the proof it was a mess. At this point I should have found another place to get my wedding invites, but I wanted to give them another chance. I responded with the changes I would like to make and told him that at this point I NEEDED them to be done in a week and a half, well what do you know...no response! When he finally did get back to me about 4 days later his lame excuse was that he doesn't check the email I sent it to everyday, well then why would you only give that email as a contact for yourself???\n\nIn the end I am not sure what his issue was delivering a simply designed invitation for my upcoming wedding in a reasonable amount of time. I ended up going to a chain office supply store (against my own better judgment) and ended up with a custom designed invitation that is beautiful in less than a day! I think it is time for this business to find a new head of the Print Shoppe (like Ashlee ;) ) or cut that part of their business out all together.

<review>"""First of all, this has nothing to do with Tapino's food or service. It may be great. In fact, that's what we were hoping.\n\nSecondly, we are big fans of what Chef Porter is trying to do. We have great respect for them advocating the locavore movement  and  using local farms  and  vendors. We're huge fans of local farmers markets  and  buy all our produce there. We're also huge fans of local independent restaurants  and  business and patronize them as much as possible.\n\nSo the birthday fail begins...\n\nOne more thing. Birthdays in my family are a big deal. Food is a big deal. We all grew up working in my dad's restaurant (the Glass Door)  and  food is hugely important to us. For birthdays, we do a fancy dinner  and  a family dinner. This was a family dinner. Lots of thought goes into choosing the place for each occasion. This was also my wife's birthday. Kind of a big deal for me. \n\nFor family dinner, we all go so we need a place that isn't too hard on the budget  and  that suits different dietary needs (some vegetarians, some food allergies). Looked at a ton of places  and  figured that we should try Tapino as they had a great food/drink special  and  we were into what they are doing. Figured it would be a gateway meal to us coming back a great deal more. \n\nOk, very last thing, kids... So we brought our kids. We've brought our kids out to eat since they were born  and  they know  and  appreciate good food. They've been places like Sea Saw, Nobu, Bouchon, etc. They know how to behave  and  are always expected to behave.\n\nSo to the story...\n\nCalled Tapino yesterday  and  spoke to the manager  and  asked if they could take a party of 12 for happy hour. She said they normally don't take reservations for happy hour but would be ready for us. Asked if they had 2 high chairs for the kids. She said no but they had low chairs  and  low tables on the patio that would work great. So we're in good shape, right?\n\nWell today, I walk in myself (without kids)  and  say that we are here for the party of 12 w/kids. The hostess said no kids allowed in bar nor on patio (as they allow smoking on the patio)  and  they don't serve happy hour in the restaurant  and  just lets it sit at that. Pretty weird. Was almost as if they'd were ready for us. \n\nOk, so if you don't want kids in your place...at least tell us. I dragged 12 people out  and  set their expectations  and  was excited to have the perfect place to celebrate my wife's birthday. Then we get there  and  you say sorry, nope?\n\nAlso, there wasn't a single person in the restaurant at this time. It was about 5:45. Not one.\n\nI'm like in shock so I tell her I spoke with someone yesterday  and  she understood our situation  and  that we were coming in. She said that she was right there when I spoke with her manager  and  they don't allow kids in the bar or on the patio  and  they don't do happy hour in the resturant. Ok, I get it. Probably heard this 7 times when I was there.\n\nMight as well have said go away, leave, we don't want you here.\n\nShe eventually said that the manager was there  and  she'd have her come talk with me.\n\nDuring the wait, I asked about last night's locavore dinner  and  told her we were excited to be there as we'd been following them on Chowhound  and  the Phoenix Hound Gathering group. Also told her I'd been talking with one of the farmers that was in for the previous night's event. Basically I let her know we know what they did  and  were into it. Might have factored in a bit? Nope.\n\nEventually, the manager came out  and  they chatted.\n\nThe manager then came over  and  changed the story  and  said we could sit in the bar at a couple of benches but kept reiterating that the kids couldn't make any noise nor move around at all. Ok, fine. First of all, we expect the kids to behave. If she'd left it with one mention, maybe we'd have just sat down. But with repeated mentions of no noise, no moving around, it was obvious they didn't want us there. I told her I felt that way  and  she said that wasn't the case but it rang quite hollow.\n\nI went outside to talk with the family  and  figured we'd probably go elsewhere as we really weren't wanted. Went in to tell the hostess (manager was nowhere around)  and  got a perfunctory sorry.\n\nJust seems like such a customer service failure. If they'd wanted us there, they could have refrained from making us feel unwelcome. Or if they were uncomfortable with kids being in the bar or on the patio, they could have easily set us up in the empty restaurant  and  offered us the same food/drink.\n\nOr they could have told us their mantra \no kids in the bar or on the patio, no happy hour in the restaurant\"""" on the phone. \n\nMaybe it was a bad situation for them but if it were me, I would have tried a little bit harder to find a solution that wouldn't have so alienated us.\n\nI don't know. I'm epxecting to see Chef Porter at OTFM  and  am friends with people who work with him  and  maybe we'll come back (sans kids of course) but right now it sure doesn't feel like it  and  it's a major bummer as Tapino seems like a place that is doing excactly what we love  and  we could have been huge fans."""""""

<review>"""OK, the restaurant experience is only as good as its weakest link. This lovely little place has great food. However there are two big issues. First, the service has to be good. We got caught in the shift change. Our 1st waiter was fine but our second waitress seemed to care less we were there. Second issue, $2.75 for an ice tea (brewed), and $2 for a refill, give me a break. As sort of icing on the cake, the waitress (yes, the one that didn't really care we were there) simply brought us our check when we finished lunch. We asked her, \hey don't you guys have pastries here?\"""" Never had to ask for desert at a pastry place. \n\nAll in all a nice place to eat but they need to focus on getting the little things right to earn those five stars."""""""

<review>3 hrs for a SmartCar oil change?! Outrageous. I even had to cancel the complimentary car wash I waited so long.\n\nAnd don't expect to get good AT and T or Verizon service in the wait area.\n\nThe SA was very nice, but came out 3 different times to upsell what totaled $1700 in repairs (for a $9000 vehicle!). Very nice customer service and waiting area, but its tough to give more than 2 stars when a simple oil change took more than twice as long as the 1 1/2 hrs they told me to expect.
</review>
<review>I used to frequent this place when it was Long Wong's.  The food wasn't good back then but it was open 24/7 and always available.\n\nSince the change in ownership, I have been repeatedly disappointed.  The size of the menu has gone down drastically (which is understandable, Long Wong's menu was way too big).  They only serve slices of pizza at certain times of the day now (noonish until 3pm supposedly I think? and again some time in the evening) and you never know if they will actually have slices.  I understand that maybe they don't sell that many slices in the off hours, but I would gladly take a slice of pizza that was an hour or two old over none at all.  Not to mention even at 3pm it is not uncommon to get a pretty old slice anyways.\n\nThe burgers are so-so.  Better than McDonald's, but just really not that good.\n\nI've only had the cheesesteak once, and boy was it a disaster.  I bit into it and what must have been a full cup of liquid poured out of it.  I'm not sure how this was possible, but it was almost like it was sabotaged.  I'm sure this was a one-off problem and that they are not normally like that, but I was horrified and have not tried another.\n\nThe owner is eager and you can tell he is really trying to make the business work.  However, the staff he hires can be very rude sometimes.  I've heard some snotty tones of voice saying they had no slices when I've tried to order a slice of pizza during the off hours and have been refused a simple refill of my soda when my order took far longer than expected.  That said, I have not been there in a few months so this may have changed.
</review>
<review>Wow, this place just sucks. What is with all of the old people here? You weren't hip three decades ago, and it's likely the same story now. And why all of the dudes? It's like 1 ugly chick for every 3 guys. And why would you take a limo here? Who the hell are you trying to impress? I noticed a few 40-year old women trying to act half their age. How tragic and pathetic. Sapporo is just a freaking mess. Avoid.

<review>Bueller, Ferris, where's the flavor.  Absent.  I had an expiring groupon for Fatburger and decided to get a to go order for work lunch.  Staff service is ok, but they had the order set up for to eat there. No biggy.   We got our order quickly and had ordered the medium fat burger.  I got the onion rings and my co-worker got the fries.  I could not taste any flavor from the burger, and the bacon had that crispy leaning on the side of burned taste.   The onion rings tasted like the onions were fresh, but still the taste was lacking.   Fatburger, I'll pass.  This place is one where I will keep driving past and not stop again.

<review>My family has been going to Warner Family Practice for 15 years and I am now looking for a new doctor's office, as this office has become money hungry and difficult to work with.  Never in my life have I experienced an office that will double charge you for one visit if you discuss more then what is included in a well visit.  They will then continue to recommend appointments for you for things that could have all been taken care of in one appointment, just to get more money out of you.  My husband was charged for 4 different office visits just to have a yearly physical.  One charge to establish him as a patient, one charge for the physical, one for labs and one because he discussed more then what is allowed during the physical.  They should have a sign in their rooms stating what is allowed to be discussed and what you will be charged extra for.  My daughter also had labs done as a result of a well visit and was charged as a separate office visit, causing us to owe hundreds of dollars when we should have owed nothing.  During a well visit, they will also schedule you for several unnecessary tests, just to get more money out of you.  Offices like this are the reason our insurance rates are outrageous!!  Stay clear of money hungry Warner Family Practice!!

<review>The dish was ok, but I won't go back. Here's why...\n\n1. The food was ok, but I've had better. It wasn't anything phenomenal. The lemongrass in my dish was hard, like I was eating a stick. I picked it out.\n2. They bring community rice! WTF??  I want my own rice, not a tiny bowl for a table of 6 people!!  I understand their soup is community as well. Totally unexpected for an Asian joint, I have never heard of this before. It sucked, I got 1 freakin' spoonful of rice.\n3. Even if they had brought me my own rice, it wasn't good anyway. It was hard and uncooked in the middle, and stone cold.\n4. Portions are very small. This is compounded by the fact that I had to share rice! I was not satisfied when I left.\n5. The server brought food out for half the table, then 3 or 4 minutes later brought out food for the other half. Are you kidding me?? \n6. It is super loud inside. We actually couldn't even talk amongst ourselves because it was so loud. I felt like I was in a bar. It was weird, I think that was the first time I have experienced such a noisy sit-down restaurant.\n7. And last but not least... no Panang?? Really?? This is a standard Thai dish and they didn't have it. Very disappointing.
</review>
<review>What a dump.  With all of our Spring Training choices...to give them money was criminal.  We actually made reservations and were delayed getting to our table by 1/2 hour.  That's where the fun started...they were out of ribs which we thought interesting for a steakhouse.  They were also out of our first two selections of chardonnay wines.  We did order reds as well for the beef, but by that time not even the overtaxed waitresses could lift our spirits.  They are wonderful, but not worth wasting an evening at this outhouse.

<review>I was prepared to love Hula's upon my first visit on a Wednesday evening.  We decided to have happy-hour appetizers as our meal and some Zombie's.  The drinks were great, however we weren't thrilled with the appetizers. \n\nWe had the sweet potato fries. They were under cooked, not good at all, and not even comparable to Fez's.  We barely touched them.\n\nWe had the Shrimp Rolls and the Fish Cakes.  The shrimp rolls were fair, a little greasy though.  The fish cakes were tough and tasteless.  They could have been silly putty cakes for all  I knew. \n\nWe also had the pulled pork tacos. They were fair, although they were served cold. \n\nMaybe it was an off night. I see so many positive reviews that I'll give it another try.

<review>We had been waiting to go here for a very long time.  I had heard such great things and since Binkley's had consistently made lists for best dining experience, I was eagerly awaiting the day I'd dine here.  To celebrate our 9 year dating anniversary, my (now) husband surprised me (well as much as he could, since it takes a good 45 minutes to drive there) by taking me here.  \n\nWe arrived and it was a nice night, so we thought we'd sit outside on the patio (which isn't the best choice it turns out, since its fairly close to the road, and you can hear/smell the cars driving by).  The menus had our names and happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  \n\nService: Our waiter seemed nervous or unsure of himself.  He faltered on the ingredients and some of the items throughout the night.  We would also have to ask to have our water to be refilled and wait some time before it actually happened.  There were lots of other staff that would bring out other dishes, but they weren't very friendly and would often not actually interact.  Mostly just bring the dish and describe without a smile and leave. \n\nFood: We decided that my husband would order an ala carte dish and I would go with the tasting menu to get the full effect.  The amuse bouche were interesting, but I wouldn't say that I was all too impressed.  They were not particularly tasty bites.  For the ala carte, my husband ordered the veal, and we were quite disappointed.  The meat was tough and quite bland.  The side dish of white beans that came with it was delicious though.   For the tasting menu, I understand that portions are smaller (and I don't eat large portions), but they were ridiculously small.  I ordered a ceviche or the cold appetizer, soft shell crab for the hot, rib eye for the meat and halibut for the fish.  The rib eye was super thin, and almost like beef jerky.  Although the flavoring was decent, it was so small and tough that it was a bit hard to eat.  I was just not super impressed and borderline disappointed by everything.\n\nI would like to say I want to come back, and I'm not sure if Binkley's just had an off day, but we were very disappointed by our experience, especially since we had such high hopes.

<review>Armadillo grill is usually a place my\nCoworkers and I like to out out together after work. The spinach dip is great and the servers are nice. Recently, I tried joining them at the bar and had the worst experience, I will not be going back. The bartender was very rude to me and after six times of asking for a menu I had to flag down a server to get any help. It took 2 hours to get an order of wings and I was very unhappy with the service. Armadillo is great if you go during happy our and sit at a table, but I would never recommend going to the bar.

<review>"""I usually love going to Mimi's, but had never been to this location before. I will never go there again. We had a party of 15 with a reservation so they knew we were coming. We waited over half an hour to get menus and then only got 4. We dealt with that and passed them around. That was the least of the issues. About 45 minutes after sitting down, our orders were taken. The bread baskets finally came. I waited about 20 minutes for a refill on my coffee and then went and got it myself. I also got extra napkins, which we had asked for, and refilled some water glasses for my group. Some of us ordered from the \Cafe Express\"""" menu, because we thought that would be easy and quick. Not so! It took at least 45 minutes from the time we ordered until ALL of our party had their food. That is inexcusable! When the food came, some of it was wrong, but we didn't dare send it back for fear that we'd never get the right food returned. Some of us would have ordered dessert, but figured it would take too long to get it, since our waiter, Tony, kept on complaining about the number of tables he had to cover and how overworked he was.\n \nOn the \""""Cafe Express\"""" menu, it states that if you don't get your food in 15 minutes, it will be free. Since they had WAY exceeded the time limit they themselves had set, I pointed that out. If it had only been 20 minutes, we would have let it go, but this was well past that. I was told that the 15 minute time limit  did not apply to large groups, though that is not stated anywhere. After some discussion, we were told the manager would adjust the bills, but it was because we insisted that they honor the commitment they made, not because they wanted to. I am not sure if the problem is in the kitchen or out on the floor, but it needs to be fixed.\n\nI will still go to Mimi's, just not that location."""""""

<review>"""This is actually the first time I have ever been to a Waffle House. My husband's cousin talks about going here all the time, so I had to check it out.\n\nOur server was friendly and she even was able to incorporate the phrase \ sausage fest \"""" into our brief conversations. In other instances this would have annoyed me because of how inappropriate it was in this setting, but while staring at her huge pregnant belly, I could do nothing but laugh.\n\nThe food was not good. The sausage gravy was way too salty, eggs were way under-cooked, waffles were average, coffee was alright ( served in a lipstick stained mug the first go around ), sausage and bacon were below average, hash browns were limp, mushy, and flavorless.\n\nI would only return to a Waffle House if this was my ONLY option."""""""

<review>I don't write many yelp reviews but I thought that I would do one on Prado because it has changed a lot since my last visit and people might not know. \n\nI've been here 2 -3 times now with my girlfriend and others.  However, the first two times were about a year ago when the restaurant had more of a spanish theme. \n\nWe went this past week (11/19/10) and were disappointed with the new italian menu. \n\nThe menu differed greatly from the one posted online, and also the one posted near the front door. Our guest was very disappointed because he had picked out what he wanted to eat while having a drink at the bar before dinner, and none of his selections were on the dinner menu once we sat down. \n\nI ordered a calamari appetizer that was an interesting idea but did not taste very good (not traditional fried calamari). It tasted very earthy, slightly like dirt.\n\nI had a crab pasta entree that was good but not memorable. My girlfriend ordered a whole (roasted?, cant remember) Branzino with gnocci. The gnocci were good, but the fish was overcooked and dry.\n\nMost importantly, the new menu no longer carries the amazing churros that Prado used to serve for dessert. Sometimes we went there just for churros. The new menu features desserts from the Julia Baker chocolate shop next door, which we also visited after dinner. The shop is cute and the chocolates are great, but the churros are sorely missed.  We also had some awesome paella from the old menu that was much better than anything we ordered off the new menu. \n\nOverall, our tourist guest was disappointed and I am going to remove Prado from our lineup.  There are many other comparable choices in the area that I prefer.  Among others, T Cook's and Lon's at the Hermosa offer the same fancy resort feel, and have better food in my opinion, now that Prado's menu has changed.

<review>"""I have to agree with the other reviews. \n\nI lived here from January 2008- January 2009.\n\nThis place blows and I absolutely hated living here.\n\nThe units are outdated, dark, and depressing.  If you live on the first floor you have no wall on your patio, aka no privacy. Kitchen appliances were terrible, carpet was cheap and uncomfortable. If you don't have a washer dryer in your unit, there's only one public laundry room that had 4 washers and 4 dryers, for like 800 people. \n\nThe PARKING. UGH!!! The worst. If you live here, you only get one assigned covered parking space. Mind you, there are only about 12 \free\"""" parking spaces. So, if you have a roommate, you guys are screwed. If you want to have friends over, tell them to get a ride or take the bus! \n\nWhen we moved out, we were charged $900 for \""""damaged carpet\"""". We never had pets, weren't smokers, maybe had 2 or 3 stains on the carpet. $900, what a scam! Had we known we would've replaced it ourselves before moving out for half the price! When we tried to inquire as to what the damage was they wouldn't return our calls or speak to us about it. \n\nThey also have a pretty open pet policy, No weight restrictions, so I was basically always stepping in huskey shit. Not their fault if people don't clean up after their dogs, I understand, but honestly this must be one of the only complex's in Scottsdale that doesn't have weight restrictions for pets. Which sounds like a good thing? Maybe to people that are cruel and think it's okay to have one or  more 50+ pound dogs in a tiny space. I however think if you have large dogs you should live, I dunno, in a house? Maybe one with a back yard?\n\nThe only reason to live here is because it's somewhat cheap. This place made me never want to live in apartments ever again, and I haven't since."""""""

<review>"""The problem with Nordstroms is you spend $$ for a nice shirt/pant/jeans and see 18 other people wearing the exact same thing in a span over the next 14 days. I prefer spending my money at places where things aren't mass \over\""""produced and expensive. For quality of the product to price, I would say Nordstroms is extremely poor.\n\nIf you think Nordstroms men's or woman's shoe selection is the largest ever...than you surely haven't been to LA, San Francisco, Miami, NYC or Chicago. \n\nBy the way, why are 1/2 the women shoes made of patent leather? I guess if you're a stripper, it's right up your alley."""""""

<review>Wow, all I can say is this place SUCKS big balls.\n\nTake your money to 24 Hour Fitness (which is literally 3 minutes from here), where your business will be appreciated. \n\nMy boyfriend and I joined back in early summer. We paid for 2 full-year memberships. We paid nearly $500 each, which I feel is high for a gym. Don't go here if you are interested in a serious workout... All the women come all dolled up. And all the guys are meatheads (especially the trainers, who need to really lay off the roids).   \n\nThe gym is very nice... clean, good/new equipment. The reason for the 1 star, however, is due to their policies and lack of customer service. When joining, they rush you through the contract to get you to sign, skipping over the fact that you are responsible for inquiring any additional fees that they deem as necessary. So, after my boyfriend and I had been working out at this location for a month, we got a bill in the mail saying we owed an additional $52 for their renovations. EXCUSE ME!?! This gym is like 5 years old... \n\nWhen I called to ask what specifically the charges were for, the manager told me it was for the new IMAX Theater, valet parking.... the list goes on. Are you serious!? Valet parking at a gym? I've never heard of something so absurd. Get exercise and walk to your own car... This is a gym for goodness sakes!\n\nThey refused to take the charges off my bill even though I would never use their useless new amenities. They said if the charges weren't paid by the due date, I wouldn't be able to work out until they were paid off (with late fees). HAHAHA. So I went to Craigslist, sold both my memberships and my 20 personal training sessions. And I didn't have to pay their outrageous fees. \n\nThere were other shortcomings, but honestly, my BP is already going through the roof from writing this review. I'm done. You can go fuck yourself Mountainside Fitness!!

<review>"""Well, damn.\n\nUntil tonight, all of our experiences at Red Robin had been positive. Even at this location, our past meals had been enjoyable.\n\nTonight, though...tonight left a sour taste in my mouth. That's not to say that the food was bad...it was actually pretty good. But the service was atrocious.\n\nWe thought it was our lucky day when we walked right in on a Saturday night and sat right down at 7:00. We ordered our appetizer and drinks. The waiter, Cameron, came back and took our order a few moments later.\n\nOur appetizer came out in record time! We had hardly taken a few bites of our hummus plate, and then our food came out! Like I said...the food was good.\n\nSo, where was the horrible service? The food was there fast, hot, and it was good. What could have bothered me so much?\n\nWell, I don't think the waiter said more than a dozen words to us. It seemed like he was late for something very important, and we were his last obstacle to overcome before he was able to free himself from the self-imposed bonds of servitude to Red Robin.\n\nCustomarily, the waiter comes around after the food arrives and asks how things tasted. This guy didn't show up until our food was gone, our drinks were gone, and we were ready for the check and couple of to-go boxes.\n\nHe begrudgingly gave me a refill on my drink before he dropped off the check. Now, granted, we don't ever get desert in a restaurant...but this guy didn't even give us the satisfaction of turning down his delicious sounding proposal.\n\nThe whole process felt like we were imposing on this kid. We were in and out of the restaurant in less than 30 minutes.  This guy robbed us of the entire restaurant experience.\n\nIf you can't enjoy the experience, then why go?\n\nIt will definitely be a while (if ever) before I visit this location again. But I can promise that I'll avoid this kid like the plague if he's still \working against his will\"""" at this location."""""""

<review>The salespeople here need a serious lesson in manners. Just because you work where they sell nice clothes does not give you the right to act like a snob and look down on people. It doesn't matter if I am here to drop a few hundred bucks, the women here look at you like you're dirt. I have given this store multiple chances and the service is so awful I would not recommend coming here unless you're ready to throw back some dirty looks. I don't understand how these people got hired and why they haven't been fired but here's a piece of advice...SMILE. Offer help. Don't look and treat people like you're better than them. If you hate your job, quit. You're making people miserable when shopping is supposed to be enjoyable.

<review>"""Based on the reviews on Yelp, I was quite excited to see this new tea shop in PHX.  My visit was less than thrilling, however.  I must pretense my review with the fact that I'm a purist, a little bit of a snob and opinionated.  I can appreciate tea blends - I make certain ones myself.  They serve a place and a purpose.  That said, I expect to be able to buy pure loose tea leaves at a place specializing in tea.  In fact, you'd think that's the main focus of a tea shop, but here it seems blends and spices are what keeps things together.\n\nThey have lots of \teas\"""" and accessories.  Maybe blends and masking tastes is what the public wants - I have no idea.  I do know that I'd think even a medium shelf, quality estate leaf would be available (or rather, the focus) at a tea shop.  I know you've seen shops like Adagio - you have their products.  When I heard this place opened, I thought it could be the first and only in PHX to really hit the nail on the head.  C4 still remains the place to go in a pinch; at least there I can get something called \""""darjeeling\"""" (even if that's almost as vague as calling it \""""Chinese black tea\"""")."""""""

<review>I haven't actually been inside Luci's, but we had lunch brought in to our office from here so I have had the food.  To start with, I wasn't very impressed by the menu, it was really small, and not very exciting to say the least.  I ended up just getting the tomato soup because it was a cold day and I figured it would warm me up.  Well the soup started out good, it was like a creamy tomato, but after a few more bites I just couldn't handle it anymore....there was way too much pepper....it made it almost inedible!  If they had backed off on the pepper it would have been good, but it was too overwhelming.\n\nAlso, they messed up quite a few of our orders, making for some unhappy people.  I think we all decided that we wouldn't be ordering from them again, and I will probably never see the inside because of our experience.

<review>Staff needs a little bit more customer service training.  Was asked at the door if my husband and I were celebrating anything and I said yes little early 10 year anniversary and didn't even get a congrats or happy early anniv. Then the waitress we had seemed to be in a hurry and kind of impatient with getting our order and drinks. The water is terrible and didn't even get a lemon when asked for the first time when she took or drink order. Then we get a hamburger and well....... we asked for med/med rare and we got rare....it was so much grease/juice coming out of the burger that the bottom bun was soaked and was not able to eat it.  Small amount of blue cheese.  This is the first place that we meet on a set up blind date and needless to say we won't be coming back.
</review>
<review>I like their food  and  drinks and they have some good deals. I've never had good luck with the service at this location though. I had a big birthday dinner here a couple years ago and they insisted that doing call-ahead seating would ensure that our party of 15 wouldn't have to wait. This sounded too good to be true for call ahead seating so I called back and talked to someone else who also insisted that doing call-ahead seating would ensure that our party of 15 wouldn't have to wait. We did call-ahead seating, we got there, we waited for an hour, and we finally split up and sat at opposite corners of the restaurant for dinner. If they hadn't been so insistent that everything would work out great and that we could sit together and wouldn't have to wait, we definitely would have gone someplace that takes reservations! RA in Scottsdale is only good for groups if you  and  your friends are up for doing sake bombs in the bar for 2 hours while you wait for your table. ;)

<review>"""If you are reading this, my guess is you are most likely go to or connected the the Asian/Chinese church in Chandler (where they get most of referrals). If not, you should be another angry customer or will be one soon. This shop charges excessive cost on parts!! Not to mention their bad attitude once they noticed you actually knew something about cars. The owners are 2 married Asian couple. I always knew car shop is a shady business, so I had a impression that I could avoid getting rip-off using mechanics who speak my native language and he will be honest with me and all. Well... BAD IDEA and probably the worst decision I ever made! I visited them a total of 3 times because I live very close by. Each time I learn something new about them and that's it. No more business from now on.\n\nGary is the mechanic and his wife is the helper. He seems like a nice guy but her wife is a total-bxxch. Every single time we walked in to the shop, she would tells us our car is very old (199X) and XXXXX is not a good brand. This upset my wife very much because this car is her baby. I mean WTF, who doesn't want to drive new car? If everything is perfect and all I need is an oil change and tune-up, why make you think I would come to you?!\n\nNot only that, when it comes to quotes, labor and part prices. She always steps out and take over from Gary. She would tell me how hard and rare to find parts for our \old\"""" car. Then, she would call the next day tells us she \""""finally found it\"""". She will at least double or even triple charge ANY parts you'll need. Trust me on this! She will refuse to use the parts you can buy, tells you Autozone suck badly and advertise their \""""Quality\"""" part and lifetime warranty (who doesn't offer lifetime or 1-3 yrs nowadays?! PLEASE, go home to check part prices online and visit other shops!\n\nIf you are not listening to me and still want to go with them because either you have too much money to give away or you trust these referral from your Asian Church... fine but please, get more quotes from different shop. Listen to more people, see what's out there. I personally knows car more than majority of people and I can tell who's a rip-off and who's not. If you ended up using them for whatever reason, remember - she will tell you that you need a $100-$200 tune up before they are able to find out what's wrong with your car - tell her NOT to fill any Windshield Wash for you because she would put some kind of dish washing soap in there and ended up all bubbly when you spray the windshield. She done that to our car, it was VERY NASTY!"""""""

<review>"""Ok, I am a big breakfast fan, trust me.  I have not had a good experience at this place.  First of all, when you drive down Scottsdale Road, you can see the lines forming outside and you would think that the Rolling Stones were in concert inside performing!!  Well, when I certainly can't get no satisfaction when it came to the food.  First of all, the service was a little frantic.  There were a ton of annoying \I think I am cool\"""" people who were obviously hungover from \""""clubbing\"""" in the Scottsdale scene the night before and all wearing sunglasses and tried to look like Paris Hilton and Nick Lashay.  Oh,  well.  As for the food, I ordered the huevos rancheros.  My friend told me that it looked like somebody vomited in a large tortilla!!  I had to agree, he was right.  The eggs were undercooked and the whites were very runny!  I was DISGUSTED!!  My friend ordered a pancake and that looked ok.  Don't order the orange juice here, they will charge you and ARM  and  A LEG!  So, bottom line...if you like long lines and enjoy watching the Scottsdale party girls and guys nurse their hangovers as they text and show off their sunglasses and then eat, this is the place for you.  If you want a good ol' fashion American breakfast, this place may not be for you.  Go to Denny's instead!  :)"""""""

<review>What can i say about Hanny's? Nice location, love the fact that is in the heart of downtown phoenix. The decor is very minimalist, at the point that is almost intimidating. The place was empty on a Sunday night witch it made the space looks even bigger.\n\nWe went with a group of nine and ordered a little of everything, asked a few question to the server which didn't know much about the menu, he had to go back to the kitchen for every question, just basic question.\n\nWhen the food arrived and after a few bites me and all the others arrived to the conclusion that Hanny's might be better for drinks, the pizza , if you can call it pizza, is more like a flat bread with very little flavor and with cheap topping, the salads were really small and again with cheap ingredients.\n\nOverall is an ok place to have a drink with friends after a dinner some place else.

<review>I was in the area for a conference so I got the opportunity to spend my per diem money on their all you can eat sushi.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  So disappointed that I just couldn't keep eating it anymore for the sake of being full.  I actually went somewhere else, because I was still hungry, and got a sandwich.  \n\nThe reasons why I didn't enjoy my meal:\n\n1.  Rice was super mushy.  Eventually, every sushi they served me had medicre rice, which totally ruined the whole meal.  \n2.  They put so much rice in their sushi so that AYCE diners will get full sooner.   I actually had to tell the sushi chef to kick back on the rice.\n3.  The fish was not as fresh as I am used to in Southern California.  One of the servers told me that this was a common complaint by non-local diners. \n\nNeedless to say, I didn't go back here during my remaining 3 days.  I actually preferred the Japanese mall food court restaurant over this.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Benihana...but this one failed me.

<review>"""Like many other reviewers, we tried Padre's because of a Groupon. \n\nWait staff was competent, and our drinks stayed mostly full.\n\nWe had the calamari as an appetizer: very overpriced at $10.95, I liked the flavor (its got a little chili mixed in with the breading). I like one of the three dipping sauces, and my wife liked a different one. When the waitress asked if we liked it, my wife indicated it was greasy and chewy. She apologized, but not really convincingly.\n\nFor entrees, I had the garlic shrimp tacos and my wife had the \Tia's Enchiladas\"""" with spinach and cheese. My tacos were 3 small tacos with a decent amount of shrimp, cilantro, lettuce, and a pineapple salsa. They weren't bad, but were not very garlicy. My wife's enchiladas were good, nothing special. The ever-present sides of refried beans were typical of the variety, and the rice was well done with good flavor. Contrary to some other reviews, I would have called the plate sizes ordinary and not \""""huge\"""".\n\nFor desert, my wife and I were going to split the banana epanadas with brandy caramel, but asked for it to be served without the brandy, as my wife has a severe alcohol allergy. The server checked with the manager and said they could do it, but that the caramel would lose a lot of its flavor without the brandy, and said it all burned off in the cooking. Well, from experience, my wife and I know it isn't true (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Food_and_cooking), so we asked for it anyway.\n\nThen the server went to place the order and the cooks said the brandy was pre-mixed with the caramel. We cancelled the desert order. It was a bit frustrating that the manager didn't know how the dishes were prepped in the kitchen.\n \nOverall, it was typical mexican food with a \""""modern\"""" take (apparently if you put pineapple salsa on shrimp tacos and a fancy swirl of sauce on the enchiladas its \""""modern\"""") -- personally, there are much better Mexican restaurants in town."""""""

<review>ON A SHOE STRING ?\nThis place has a really nice tap beer selection. In the first months after they opened I went back 7 or 8 times until I had tried most all of them. \n\nI tried three or four different menu items. The food was OK. Wife loved the crab cakes. \n\nService was always very friendly but they frequently seem to be operating with a skeleton crew. Like the same person is the hostess slash bartender slash waitress slash cook slash dishwasher. I usually just stopped in to try a different beer so when the server dissapeared for long stretches of time it wasn't that big a deal. \n\nThe atmosphere is a little off.  They have this great tap selection paired with a tiny 4 stool bar in a really big pub. Odd set up.  In another area their are some high tables right next to the main eating area which are booths. So you could be trying to eat a nice quiet restaurant style lunch just feet away from jukebox blasting, beer swilling, pool shooting hooligans. There is just something not right about the floor plan.  It is like they ran out of money before they could remodel the inside to fit the business.\n\nI still visit every so often because they change up their draft beer selection. Unfortunately because of the atmosphere and staffing quirks it is not a place I can throw an extra star or two.

<review>To put this review in context, I was looking for a meal in the same vein as Ruth's Chris's or Morton's steakhouse.  Having eaten at Houston's (in Houston), I thought this would be a great place to get a steak.  I was probably shooting a little high.  Service was good, but there were issues with the food.  First off they ran out of baked potatoes, not a big deal but perhaps a little foreshadowing?  The Steak came out with no red in the center, probably a solid medium.  The redone steak came out a little more pink (not red), but still did not have the deep, meaty flavor I was craving.  The Fish sandwich we ordered was good, as were the cole slaw and broccoli sides.  In other words, I would come back here for lunch (the fish sandwich), but not the steak.  I can't comment on the sushi, maybe this is what they are concentrating on.  I would not avoid this place, but it certainly isn't worth going out of my way to visit.
</review>
<review>I know this place is a Phoenix institution.  And it is quite nice inside compared to many Chinese restaurants.  I was invited to lunch here by a colleague who had dined here many times in the past.\n\nI felt the lunch menu was perhaps a bit overpriced, given the quantity and quality of food.\n\ni ordered the kung pao shrimp ($8.25), which was a spicy dish, but ordered it HOT.  It came so mild I might as well have ordered shrimp in lobster sauce, with some peanuts thrown in.   There were about 10 peanuts, a 1/2 cup of sauteed green onions, and about 4 medium sized shrimp, to go with fried rice that had nothing in it and an egg roll the size of my thumb.  It WAS nice it came with hot tea.\n\nWas it outrageously priced?  Absolutely not.  Would I eat here again if someone invited me?  Of course.  But if it's my choice, there are much better Chinese restaurants to be found.

<review>I love Safeway.  LOVELOVELOVE Safeway.  Affordable blood orange Italian soda and Burt's Bees chapstick in the same place?  I'm in!\n\nAt this location, there's always something wrong at the deli.  ALWAYS.  Sometimes you just want a sandwich, hassle free.  That isn't going to happen here.  Still, the food is good when you can get it and using a Safeway card to get the occasional free sandwich is awesome in my book.\n\nThey're always out of blood orange Italian soda.  Blueberry and pomegranate seem to be in every single time, but not once have I seen blood orange on the shelf.  I think the label is up for decoration.\n\nI've been accosted by a Channel 12 reporter in the parking lot with a large, fuzzy microphone who refused to be blown off and shoved it inside my car window so I couldn't even back out on him.  I've decided to blame Safeway for this transgression since I'm already harboring a deep hatred.\n\nThey're always out of everything I'm looking after.  I don't know how this is possible, but they've found a way.\n\nThere's a ridiculous Starbucks kiosk.  This makes two Starbucks in the same parking lot, three within less than a mile.\n\nThe stucco is literally peeling off of the building.\n\nYou know the Soviet Safeway in Washington DC?  This Safeway makes its east coast counterpart look good.\n\nAll I ever want is a sandwich and Italian soda, but somehow they always make sure something stands in my way.  Seriously, guys?

<review>"""I was craving pizza. I wanted to try somewhere local and found this place across the street from hotel. I ordered to go, and the host was bubbly and cute. I didnt know what I wanted so I decided to try the \recommended\"""" pizza skins and the numero uno deep dish. \n\nThe skins came the size of a peresonal pizza and had the deep dish crust, looking like a pizza, but it was filled with mashed potatoes and topped with bacon bits. I do not recommend. It was too starchy, and not enough flavor. I only had one piece. \n\nThe pizza was good. It was basically a combination and the personal pizza was huge. The crust became a bit much after a few pieces, but the filling was great. I think the restaurant has better options, but rating purely on food I was not impressed.  \n\nIf I were ever to go back, id keep it simple... a pepperoni thin crust."""""""

<review>I love the emporium of beauty products that is Ulta, but the customer service is h-o-r-r-e-n-d-o-u-s! And I don't think that's exclusive to this location, either. How hard is it to at least pretend you enjoy your job? \n\nThis last year, the only person I can recall ever being greeted by / assisted by in this store was Heidi. She helped me find a Bare Escentuals eye brightener I was looking for. She even went as far to show me how to apply it (without me asking), and . . . *gasp* appeared ENTHUSED about her job! \n\nI don't think I would waste my time coming into this store if they didn't carry Bare Minerals products. Plus, it's on my drive home from work, so it's a matter of convenience really.

<review>So I had a 50 dollar coupon from local dines---wanted to take my husband there for his birthday in May but because of difficult schedules decided to go this week if available---Usually go once a year for the last 12 years and was looking forward to it.  Cocktails, hubby asks to try the merlot and the pinot--waiter says you don't have to try---the pinot is awesome, we say ok--he brings the pinot---it is awful!!  Send it back and get the other wine which is just ok.  Ordered the scallops , 3, for $18 dollars, and they split it for us--good but 3 scallops for 18, think you are starting to get my gest, ordered the beet salad for $13, split  good, split the Halibut for $36---fish in a sauce with vegetables,bread was good, then split the dessert for 9 dollars.  I started out ordering a Grey Goose Martini up---small martini--must have cost at least $13---asked for blue cheese stuffed olives---the waiter said they did not receive a shipment of them today---I always found that restaurants of this calibur stuffed their own---so they brought me a small martini with small unstuffed green olives, no pimentos even---The food was ok---surprised to see the younger female generation walking in with short jean shorts---so our total was $120 without tip, they of course forgot to subtract the $50 dollar coupon  which they did correct.  When waiting for our car before entering, we heard the valet tell another customer that Vincent was not there that night and it was not good when he's not there---should have left then--food was a B-B+-we split glad we did---disappointed in all and will we go back---not for a long, long time.  Hope Vincent reads this---there is work to be done here!!

<review>A PERFECT marriage between Party On  and  Bottom Of the Barrel.  First experience here reminded me of what happens to us all after a few too many to drink.  A friend wanted to show me out and suggested this location to end the night after 2a.m. Lets just say the cab didn't get far before I got back in.  It was a mix of 'clicks' still dancing the night away surrounded by the hopefuls and out of shape-late 40 something's preparing to pounce at the first sight of a wounded gazelle.  Looks like I better try this place out once more under different circumstances as the previous reviews show it may have  potential.
</review>
<review>I have observed little to no reviews. Could be folks have given up. I agree with the little sample cups, it shows to me the employees are not real happy about coming from behind the counter. Just last month we lost our rewards program to a electronic book that you need to enter your phone number for as many yogurts you have purchased. They count on you not spending the time to do that. They need an IT guy to fix that. Product is great, service is not.

<review>"""I go to Mill Ave quite often with my friends because it's the cheap bar hopping street to go on a college budget.   Zuma Grill is often one of  the places they want to start their night because they usually have some sort of cheap drink special. \n\nI do not go for the food but if you're looking for the nightlife experience be forewarned.\n\nFirst off Zuma is fairly small and gets really crowded especially on the weekend and it takes some time to finally get a drink from the bar. Once you actually get up to the bar I feel like the bartenders are very pick and choosy about who they serve, esp the women bartenders. I am a female and I swear every time a girl is bartending she helps every single guy before she helps me. I hate to talk badly about other girls but I feel like I'm not welcomed because the girls send out bad vibes. \n\nOne night when I was out with my friends they mentioned that a  drink was 2 dollars on special that they just got so I ordered two for me and a friend. When I got my bill it was 4.50 each and I said my friends just got this for $2 and they said they didn't know what I was talking about.  I was completely offended and wouldn't of ordered the drink and my friends were like why did she charge you more?  And this was around 9 pm when there was no one in the bar and it wasn't even busy. \n\nOn Halloween weekend last year when it was especially packed and the music was way too loud to even hear myself talk I worked my way up to the bar and asked if we could have 2 Zuma juices on separate cards. The girl that was bar-tending made a mean face and ignored me and helped everyone else that came after me to the bar(that were guys). I was waiting for maybe 10 minutes until I finally was like put it all on my card. She helped me hesitatingly and made some comment (that I couldn't even hear) and when my friend asked for her name she said \Don't worry about it\""""  I was not drunk there was no reason for her to refuse to serve me and I didn't think my request was an outrageous one. \n\nAfter these stints, and along with all the guys that go in there being extremely douchey(and always running into you because it's so damn small in there) and really nothing cool about Zuma that they offer I REFUSE to spend any money there. I am always spreading the word of their bad service and when my friends suggest to go there I recommend some other place to go.\n\nAlso their bathrooms are tiny with 2 stalls and looks like no one ever cleans them or the floors in the entire bar for that matter.  Also an added bonus is the bouncers only let a few people in every 5 minutes and of course allow the people that they probably know or slept with in in front of everybody. And they try to get you to pay them to get in front of people when you ask why they let other people in.\n\nThey also play the same generic music most bars play and there is nothing unique about Zuma. If you just feel like standing around in a tight packed bar not hearing what anyone says and getting terrible service then I guess it's a good place for you.\n\nIf you're new to Mill Ave and are looking for the Mill experience I suggest you pop in next door to Cue Club (which can also be packed but you'll actually be able to have a conversation with someone and play some pool!) that has cheap long-islands lots more room and awesome bartenders who are always friendly. \n\nZuma has yet to redeem themselves. My suggestion is to have a friendlier staff that doesn't think they're better than everyone walking in."""""""

<review>Damn you Yelpers you steered me wrong!!  I agreed to go to this place only after reading all of these glorious reviews on Yelp, only to be in for a rude awakening upon my arrival.  \n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the phrase you get what you pay for has never rang more true for me.\n\nI love Middle Eastern food, like seriously, no joke.  So how excited was I to try a new Middle Eastern restaurant not too far from my office with ridiculously low prices?? You can probably figure it out from there.\n\nThe meal started out okay.  I got a pretty darn big piece of Spanakopita for $1.95, which excited me.  It was decent, not very flavorful to be honest but for $1.95 I'll eat them all day long. My boss ordered a side of hummus to start, and his story was pretty much the same.\n\nWe then both ordered the Chicken Kabob sandwich for a whopping $3.99 and I was stoked. Until it arrived that is.\n\nI took one bite and could tell right away that something was not right, with the chicken I mean.  After I taste a funky piece of meat, that's it. I will not be taking another bite. It just won't happen.\n\nI did however perform a little surgery on one piece on a side plate to discover that as I suspected, the inside was pink, as in NOT FULLY COOKED.  It took a bit out of me to not get sick right there at the table.\n\nI was hungry though so I tried to eat around the chicken, only to discover that this was the dryest chicken kabob sandwich I had ever had.  I probably should've figured that out by watching my boss douse his with the entire appetizer of hummus to add some flavor, but what can I say, I like to figure some things out on my own.\n\nAll in all my meal ending up costing less than $6, which was sweet, except for the fact that I didn't really eat anything.\n\nOh, and I should probably mention that we got back to the office and my boss didn't stop bitching all afternoon about how badly his stomach hurt. I believe that's called salmonella : )\n\nAnyways, I'm a bit surprised that I had such a lousy experience with so many great reviews before me.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe all the reviewers before me were blinded by the price, regardless, I won't be back to find out.

<review>"""Rude, rude, rude. I will *never* go back to this place. I don't normally carry cash and when I went to pick up my son's pants for his recital that night, I was in a little bit of a jam (they only take cash or checks). When I suggested they might put this on the claim ticket, or at least mention it when people drop off their clothes, the owner pointed to an itty bitty sign and told me \we have signs everywhere.\"""" The owner was hostile and argumentative and just didn't care about what I had to say. Then he hovered over me while my son tried his pants on, like I was going to steal something (the place is TINY). I went to an ATM and pulled out cash, it wasn't that big of a deal, but this place has no customer service skills whatsoever. I won't ever go there again. Steer clear."""""""

<review>This place was just okay for me. As a vegan, there were hardly any options for me and what I did get definitely left something to be desired. I also spent way more money than I expected to ($2.50 to add a tiny glob of guac? Really?).\n\nI did love the salsas, though, and the hot sauce is very tasty. I would go back and just munch on the chips and dips that they bring you, but I wouldn't order anything off the menu. I've had better Mexican food for cheaper.

<review>"""My girlfriend and I came here for dinner on a Friday night. We were led to a table outside and told our waiter would be with us in a few minutes. We proceeded to sit there for over 20 minutes while no one came to our table .Numerous people were sat around us outside and the host came outside multiple times and seemed to just stare at us. We proceeded to leave .On our way out, the host had the nerve to just look at me and say \Thanks for coming in\"""" with more than just a hint of attitude. The service at this place sucks and the hipper than thou attitude is a joke. Stay away."""""""

<review>Nick's has been a pretty popular gathering place for a group of my friends. I have had their pizzas, calzones,  and chicken parmesan. Those dishes have been pretty good. \n\nLast night I wanted to try something new, so I tried the baked ziti with meatballs. I don't recommend it. The issue was that it was overcooked. The ziti was rubbery and the dish was dry. The ends of the ziti were hard and crunchy. The best thing about the dish was the meatballs. \n\nEven though my food was not up to par, the service was exceptionally good.
</review>
<review>The food is okay for an average chinese style buffet as long as you get there early. After 8:pm the cooked food at the grill and some of the hot food in the dishes are old looking and need to be replaced. It is decent, but basically the same as everywhere else the low priced buffets are. The Sushi is decent as well.\n\nThe thing that really got to me is that while leaving the restaurant after you pay, there are two wire mesh containers on the counter where people leave tips. ( similar to a starbucks). I have seen them overflowing. The only problem with this is that the staff get NONE of it. Thats correct, the owner keeps all of it. So if you leave a tip for someone thinking that the workers are getting something for their hard work, they get nothing. I think they should be removed, and I think it is VERY deceptive.\n\nI just returned there yesterday, 11/19/2012 and the food has gotten much worse. There were items that were old and dry, and it seemed to me that there were money issues. There were three servers all handging oot in the back and talking and ignoring everyone. Even the names of the items were wrong. For 8.99 plus tax you can do better...much better.
</review>
<review>Wow how can you screw up pizza? This place did. Soggy and flavorless and we got attitude from the manager (owner?) when one of crew asked for a fork and knife. There was no way you could pick up the pizza to eat it! Service was slow, yes there were ten of us, but it was lunchtime and it's slices!  How hard can that be to reheat and serve them up?! Lame place they get one star for the air conditioning. Brooklyn attitude with Dominos Pizza quality.

<review>"""Planned to stay for a relaxing labor day weekend.  Purchased tickets on their own website and selected the room with a golf course view for $10 extra than the regular price.  It appeared to be a good deal since the reviews on Tripadvisor gave the resort a 4.5 (out of 5) star rating for customer reviews.  Along with the resort rating of being a 4star facility, we thought we should be fine.\n\nUnfortunately, we did not stay longer than an hour!  \n\nThe hotel itself had character with an old southwestern decor.  The approach to the property was welcoming with  spectacular landscaping.  Customer service was good with friendly and courteous staff (mostly from the valet and door guys), although the front desk staff were pleasant and not directly rude!\n\nWe were given our room and went to start our relaxing weekend only to find the room we had did not have a golf course view (well... it would have if there were not two huge trees in front of the window!)  The room was small but nicely decorated.  My hubby (affected by allergies, hay fever etc) began sneezing almost immediately on entering the room, which was due to the dust layer on window shutters, phone, table, tv stand and headboard - dusty as though the room had not been used for a few weeks!  We called the front desk to ask if we might be able to move rooms -  the person on the phone said \Let me see what we can do\"""" and then the phone went dead.  We waited for about 5 minutes to see if he would call back but nothing!  Strange... we assumed he put the phone down by accident and didn't make a note of our room!  So we called back again and spoke to a lady who said \""""OK give me a moment to see what we have and i will call you back\"""".  This time we waited about 10 minutes but no call back.  Obviously, my hubby could not stay in the room during the this time and we were simply waiting in the area of the room in case a manager came to see what our problem was.  We ended up going back to the reception and spoke to yet another person.  I explained we had spoken to two other people but that comment was ignored and none of the other staff identified that I had spoken to them even though they all could hear me!  The young lady said she would look to see if there was another available room, after a while she offered a casita but noted it was 50ft smaller than the room we were in - I asked if she meant 50sq ft and she said \""""no, 50 feet\""""!!!!  Anyway, before I digress on such a minor point, my husband asked if it was possible we could have a refund.  She said \""""yes no problem\"""" without a fuss - I believe this was only because we had booked directly on their site, not using Priceline or other such service (which we use a lot ourselves and have had great service through).  We left and booked into the JW Marriott Desert Ridge (paid more but had a stress free, clean, pleasant and relaxing weekend).  Both these are rated 4star but in our well traveled experience, the Scottsdale Resort should be rated 2.5 or 3 star.   \n\nWe agree with the resort fees being a rip off - just like the airline charging baggage fees.... put it in the overall cost and don't tell us about it, unless we ask for a breakdown.  Adding it on after you arrive is a real turn off!"""""""

<review>I think the only thing that could make this place more chaotic at lunchtime is if the building were on fire. Even then, you probably couldn't tell the difference.\n\nI was told the sub rolls were no good so she put me in a 7-grain.... which was $1 extra. They sold me a drink for iced tea (only there was no ice. Or tea. And no plans to refill either). Slightly warm lemonade to wash down my turkey sandwich? WHERE DO I SIGN UP!?!?\n\nSuch prime real estate deserves better... Prices are cheap but much better sandwiches around town. I'd take a knuckle sandwich over a Jimmy John's.

<review>If you're looking for a healthy meal with tons of Gluten Free or Lactose Free options - Nourish is your place. I was dining with my friend Michelle who had come off of a massive pig-out stooper and was looking for a lighter, healthier dining experience. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan and it was good although maybe because I am pregnant I couldn't really get into it as much as Michelle was. She had the protein burger and enjoyed it as well. I will say the atmosphere isn't anything special and because of it's size it can be a bit noisy inside. It is tough to access the restaurant because it is located in the Optima in Scottsdale so parking is in the underground garage. The service is great and the friendly staff help make it a pleasant experience it just wasn't a place that I was head over heals for....

<review>Went to ricos for lunch with a friend last week. The place was a ghost town. The food was ok. a bit over cooked for my taste. I have had better. I stay at the hilton alot and I have had way better dining experiences at Aunt Chilada's down the street. Don't get me wrong... The place is beautiful. I guess I'll have to try it again. Maybe try the fish tacos as someone else said they were good. I'm a die hard Chilada fan. What can I say.

<review>We have been going to Hula Hawaiian BBQ in Buckeye since it opened. At the beginning they were competing with the local Chinese joint. Hula's food was not great, but it was good and the portions were very generous. Later on the local Chinese joint went t!ts up and Hula was the only remotely Asian place in town. Lately the quality of the food has gone downhill and the portions leave much to be desired. The prices, however, didn't change; we spend on average $20 there. Today, 8/23/2011 at around 7pm, I went with my family again but only my wife ordered food totaling about $12 and me and my 8yo son brought a couple of sandwiches from Quiznos next door. Like we always do, we all shared on my wife's drink. We've always had free refills at Hula but today, when I sent my son to refill his soda he was told that we couldn't because we brought food from outside and can't share. WTF??? REALLY??? After I've spent hundreds of $ in that place over the years they're denying a kid a $.05 refill? Well, we're done! That $.05 soda refill just cost you our business. Buckeye is a very small town and restaurants here can't afford to lose business. That explains why the joint was empty. Oh joy! They're opening a Panda Express next door!

<review>this place sucked u walk in cash only had to go to chevron and pull money out biggest mistake i should have stayed out so its $6.95 with a drink and you have to get ice tea to get refills all the good ones u have to pay (not that the others were any better) another $1.40 (retarded) the selection is 4 or 5 dishes which include chicken, fried rice, fried noodles, small freaken veggie egg rolls and some pepper chicken (WTF) seat selection is not bad but you see drunk indians go behind the gas station not to mention if you need the restroom its a door that goes outside to another door smh this is NOT place you wanna go sorry but i will never return

<review>"""Visited 5.27.2012 (@2:45pm)\n\nThis is only the second time that I have eaten at this location and my boyfriend and I had pretty terrible service.  When we walked and asked if we could sit outside the hostess handed us menus and told us to sit wherever.  So we did. We sat there for about 15 minutes.  A few waitresses smiled at us but no one asked if we had been helped. \n\nFinally, a waitress came over who didn't know the price differences between domestic or foreign beer - only new the specials.  Then she left to find out how much a Kiltlifter draft would be - $6 (kind of pricey) but my boyfriend ordered one anyways.  I ordered a bloody mary.  The drinks seemed to take a long time and the waitress explained that my bloody mary was what was holding things up. Truthfully it wasn't busy at all and the bartender should have had no problems pouring a draft beer and mixing vodka with bloody mary mix pretty quickly.  When the drinks came (brought by a different waitress) there were no garnishments for my drink.  I had to get up to get my own (no bloody mary bar either).  The food came, again from a different waitress, but we had no napkins or silverwear.  I stole one off of the table next to us and went in for another. When I asked the bartender - he told (rather rudely) a waitress to \get her a place setting.\""""  I was really appalled by the way he spoke to her.  We started eating and the original waitress stopped by to see how our meal was and the food was pretty good so we both said good.  \n\nWhen the bill came I was pretty disappointed that the waitress did not inform us that there would be an up-charge for sweet potato fries.  So his burger and my Caesar chicken wrap were $13 each. \n\nHaving been to many downtown restaurants where I have received great service I could not let this experience go by without saying something.  I regret not saying something at the time but the staff didn't seem to appreciate our patronage in the first place.  Go to Arrogant Butcher if it is open instead.\n\nS~"""""""

Apparently they don't read their Yelp reviews or even care what the customer has to say because once more as I went through the drive thru and ordered 2 large TWIST ice creams with sprinkles in a bowl the person at the window either needs to have their ears checked, hearing aids implemented or just plain be banished from this earth because I was served 2 VANILLA ice creams with sprinkles in a bowl..... looking at my receipt - AMAZING 2 TWIST ice creams were ordered (so I'm not crazy- Hallelujah!)\n\nDairy Queen, I'm done- stick a fork in me. And you're lucky I didn't  just throw my ice creams at the idiotic lady who served me... At this point the assault charges that would have followed would be worth it after numerous times you've failed to serve the customer correctly.

<review>"""On our way back from Vegas we decided to stop for dinner and figured there may be options in Wickenburg...and Wikiup was out of the question since the last time we stopped there we saw racism blasted on the walls.

So I was craving Mexican food being fully aware we wouldn't find anything that could compare to places in Phoenix we saw the Rancho 7 Restaurant and a sign that said \Mexican and American Food.\""""  Bingo.   Ok.....fast forward to me biting into my chicken enchilada plate....what?!?!  I never knew \""""Mexican food\"""" even \""""Gringo Mexican food\"""" could be so bland.  Seriously?

<review>Epic fail for this place. \n\nI was just out wandering around thinking about what to make for New Years Eve Dinner.  So I thought I would pick up a pound of their signature ham.\n\nTo my dismay, once I brought it home in the sealed non-see thru packaging, it had no authentic glaze on it whatsoever.  And if you know ham, then you know that ham aint ham unless you have it glazed.\n\nSo it was extremely dissapointing to say the least, I will be calling the manager back to see what they have to say and if they make good on the mistake.

I ordered my food, nothing crazy, just a crispy chicken sandwich with a little ranch added. I pulled up behind a car at the second window and then WAITED FOR TEN MINUTES. I know that isn't a huge amount of time, but what the hell were they doing in there? It's McDonald's! It's supposed to be super fast! When I finally got to the window, it was then another almost five minute wait. I asked the guy what was going on and said \there was a mixup with my food\"""". Huh?

<review>I didn't expect much from a mall food court cajun restaurant. I tried a sample of the Bourbon Chicken and it was incredibly good. So I got that and the cajun shrimp and garlic noodles.\n\nThe  Bourbon chicken was nothing like the sample I had just tried even though they got it from the same dish. The one I tried was full of flavor, moist and plump. What I was served was small over cooked pieced of chicken that were bland.\n\nNow regarding the shrimp, maybe this is was how it was supposed to be and I just did not know it, but I did not expect to bite into a FRIED piece of shrimp with the shell and legs still on! Thats right they breaded over the shell. You had to peel the breading off so you could take the shell off.  What a friggin mess. Now I will admit that the shrimp and breading were rather tasty, but so not worth the effort and mess.\n\nNow the noodles. mushy, sticky flavorless. need I say more?\nWont be back to this place ever

<review>When this place first opened, they tried their best to please the customer.  Every time I told them they missed something, they would go back over it and clean it properly.  The last time I took my car there, I was less than happy with the service I received.  Cleaning wheels thoroughly is a standard practice at any car wash or detail shop and being confrontational with a customer when confronted with the fact that the wheels were poorly cleaned does not sit well with me.  The other thing that does not sit well with me is the upselling of services I do not need.  I don't need you to replace my windshield, redo my tint, change my oil, or any maintenance service.  If I pay for a car wash, I expect just that and expect my wheels to be cleaned thoroughly!!!

Sign said seat yourself. Ordered a water to drink, was a toss up between a sandwich or pizza/wings. Decided to go with special. Server comes over I ordered she said the special is actually 4.95 not 4.50, well then change it. Anyways not a big deal, she didn't ask if I wanted a\nCoke I'm assuming because she seen my water. Food came out and it looked good. I was disappointed that the crust was too doughy and may have ruined the extra cheese experience. Meh...not rushing back..

<review>Rock Bottom continues to earn it's name. I have been to this location on 5 separate occasions because my partner likes the beer varieties and the Pretzels. He has stopped telling me we are headed here because I will get them to change their mind before we arrive. After this last visit I told them that there are no more redeeming factors for me at this restaurant and I am not returning.\n\nChicken Oscar ~ belongs right in the trash with its muppet fur of shredded canned crab meat stuffed inside. Special of the night? It was a disaster and took forever to prepare. When I got it the chicken was dry and burnt all on the bottom. I could easily split the chicken open and see that the stuffing was a light smear of obvious canned shredded clam. The asparagus was hard and over buttered and the mashed potatoes were heavy and uninspired. It took so long and I couldn't get the waitstaff attention to bother returning it or thinking of more food to try. \nMy partner had a burger, it was nothing special. The good part of that meal were the kettle chips, really! They were awesome.\nWe enjoyed our pretzels very much.\nWe didn't stay for dessert, we've had problems with three of their desserts in the past and we weren't going to try them again.\nService and wait staff were slow and uninterested, it's July and it must suck to work there with it mostly empty, I know servers make crap, so I left a fair tip, but I'm done. \n\nIn this economic climate, either get good at what you do or go away. There are better places to eat. Tons of them.

<review>I work in fine dining, and this place would have failed any shoppers report. \n\nThe server never introduced himself and was negligent in attention to us. \nThe food portions were so small I was very disappointed that they charged so much.\nManagement was scared and hesitant to check in on us and primary paced the restaurant dreading any social interaction. \n\nMy biggest concern and reason I am bothering to write this review is the PORTION SIZE. And perhaps it was just what we had ordered, but the Hamachi was barely more than two bites and the Dinosaur salad was just cheesy large kale pieces. \n\nDrinks were tasty. If ever I go back, it will be for their bar ONLY.

<review>Went there as a walk in. Thought they should be great since they were rated number 1 for 2011. I went there for a mani/ pedi. The girl I got spoke way too softly an\nD her English was not that great. She got me to upgrade and add the paraffin wax treatment to both hands and feet. She was quite abrupt with the way she handled me. Not at all relaxing. After she was done and I was home I thought my feet felt warm but didn't think much of it. Well it's been 3 days and my feet are still hot and red. Hurts to walk to much on them. They look burnt. Also the nail art she did was crap. The little stones she glued on were not clear, but murky so they didn't shine at all. Iwent back to Ahwatukee nails for them to redo my nails and nail art. They do an outstanding job there. Definitely will not go back to Angel Touch.

<review>"""You can always tell a theater is going to be really horrible when they spell their name \Theatre.\"""" Mark it down. This rule will never fail you.\n\nThe Marquee Theatre offers a collection of everything you don't ever want to experience in a venue. Every part of the building and staff are a complete joykill. I was there on Dec 1st 2010 and every step of the way I considered leaving. I will never return no matter how badly I want to see the act.\n\nParking here is nearly non-existent. We walked far from a parking garage across busy roads to get to the building. Walking up to the front, the grounds were littered with trash amongst the overgrown weeds and potholed concrete. \n\nTo get into the building we had to push through a crowd that had no attempted organization. There are no queues and no one directing any sort of a line.\n\nWhen we reached the front of the line finally, we were told to take off our shoes outdoors. I saw several kids barefoot on the glass-strewn ground. Then a hideous troll groped me and told me to empty my pockets.\n\nOnce inside, there was a very foul odor. This couldn't be due to the current  human traffic because the event had not even started yet. I was immediately thankful we took our shoes off outside and not in here because the floor was filthy and sticky.\n\nWe went to get a drink before the show started and were met by the surliest bartenders I have ever experienced. The theater inside is exactly like being at a rave in an abandoned warehouse. So try not to think about the fact that you PAID to be here.\n\nYou will not like this place unless you have killed ALL your braincells like too many of the area's students."""""""

<review>I just finished my BSIT degree.  I would not recommend U of P to anyone looking at learning something.  If you already have the experience and just need the degree like I did it is ok.  I still was frustrated spending $1200 a class for not learning anything.  The best classes I had were the general education classes.  My IT classes were poorly thought up and had horrible content.  One example is that a teacher was showing us the inside of a computer and didn't even know where the CMOS battery was.  I know I'm a geek for knowing where to non IT people but this is a major problem.  \n\nI have had a few friends go here as well and all have the same problems.  Many of the team learning assignments are challenging because the other group members are just looking to take up space and get your good grade.  You will fail based on your other members if you don't do their work.  So it's just a mess.\n\nI am glad to be able to have a degree though which is why they have 2 stars not 1.  Just do yourself a favor go to a real school get a real education and be happy.  :)

<review>It's Sunday, right?\n\nDo I have your attention?  It's Sunday, and Barry's Capezio is closed, right?  You need dance supplies for yours or your daughter's dancing class tomorrow and the dance store that you always go to is closed.   You're looking for an alternative and you found this place.  Please don't be tempted.\n\nWhen we went, service seemed friendly, but the consequences for our choice came later.  Our daughter was about ready to begin classes for pointe, and we described to them our situation.  We, on their advice, walked out with demi-pointe shoes--this was the WRONG ADVICE!  No fitting (other than to try them on), no advice as to care, just hand us the shoes and ring us up.  Nothing else.  To see the pain on my daughter's face after that first class was agonizing, as were the huge blisters all over her feet.\n\nWait.  Please wait until Monday.

<review>Seriously!?  So I ordered from them twice last week.  Delivery.  They messed up my order just a little (wrong bread) on one of them, eh, no big deal.  The delivery time was OK, but not fast...about 20 minutes.  Well today, I need to leave my house for a job interview at 12:45, so I order at 12:15.  I wait till 12:50, then leave.  My wife is still home... apparently they showed up around 1.  Sorry, but that is not freaky fast, at all!  Then they have the nerve to say I am out of their delivery area.  Then what are you doing?  Did they tell me this and say it make take longer than usual, NO.  Did they decline my order for delivery, NO.   Not to mention why they heck am I out of your delivery range...I live at 87th  and  Bell - 1 mile from your shop.  I canceled my order and they gave me my money back, but the whole situation is very frustrating!\n\nI love the food and when I have ordered from other locations it is truly freaky fast.  Very disappointed in how this location carries the JJs name.

<review>No Bueno!!!\n\nThis place looks nothing like the photo's on the Ramada Website! The halls smelled like cigarette smoke as did all 3 rooms I looked at. It needs a total remodel. Better yet, bull doze it down and forget about it. Also, it's in an industrial area/commercial area that has a lot of closed business'. The walls are paper thin and the furnishings are old and busted. Keep going up 101 to the next exit. I do have to mention the staff was really nice! They deserve a better facility to work at!!
</review>
<review>So I only give 2 stars because I don't think you should fancy up a burger.  I've had some really amazing burgers for cheap.  That being said, the burger was good.  The truffle fries were ok...a bit too oily.  Nothing out of this world but ok.  The location is convenient being in the mall and the atmosphere is nice.  One weird thing are the cows wallpapering the place.  I'd rather not see what I'm eating while I'm eating.  Kinda freaked me out.  \nSeems like a great place to grab a beer and watch a game on a Sunday.

The sandwich had turkey so it had to be remade.  This time, there was no lettuce or the spicy mustard ordered.  When we asked our server, he returned with raspberry dressing. This was pointed out and he finally returned with the correct mustard.  By this time, the croissant was a greasy, sloppy mess.\n\nI ordered the french dip which was OK, but the beef was cold and dry which leads me to believe it was made first then sat and sat and sat...  the potatoes in the potato salad had good consistency, but instead of a creamy mix, it was little potatoes swimming in a cream based sauce.  Not sure if this was correct, but ...\n\nThe comment card in our bill folder was even pre-filled.  I flipped it over and wrote my thought for them there too.  I hope this place gets its act together.\n\nAlso, the staff should stop worrying about how they look and worry about the guests."""""""

<review>After reading the reviews, we were excited to experience sushi nirvana. Didn't quite get there.  We started with the Deluxe Sashimi Platter.  Around $125, the presentation was gorgeous.  Chef's choice sashimi, it does include some of the harder to find specialities.  We also had the Grilled Pork Belly which had great flavor, but the amount of fat was too much to handle.  The crispy fried squid with chili and lime was flavorful.  Overall the flavor, atmosphere and service was good.  But that's just it.  It was merely good.  I can't complain about the taste or quality of the food, but I can't write home about it either.  I've been known to pay a lot for a meal.  This one was not worth it.
</review>
<review>Uh...how is it that this place has so many good reviews?!  I love me a good burger and there are a few places in town that serve yummy burgers, Delux being one.  In retrospect we should have gone there instead but we, my beau and I, wanted to try a new place.  Yeah, well that'll learn us.  This place was soooo gross .  I don't think I have ever had such a greasy burger.  I was excited to see fried pickles on the menu, since I haven't had fried pickles since I left the South.  Well that excitement was quickly snuffed out after my first bite.  I think it's safe to say that we will  not being going back there again.
</review>
<review>If I could get service on a regular basis, I'd maybe rate the food at 4/5 stars. But I've just about given up. This location has a major problem with spotty service, and you never know what you will get. Sometimes, it's great, with an attentive, personable server.  Just as likely you'll get completely ignored even when it's not busy. About 6 months ago, my husband contacted corporate about the problem. They were apologetic and seemed truly concerned, and even sent a $40 gift card as an apology. We've been back a few times since then, and I will miss the garlic fries and southwest chicken sandwich. But we won't be back. When  you're hungry and willing to spend $20 a person for a decent dinner, you don't want to play the lottery to see if you'll get service or not.

<review>"""\Hot Mess\"""" \nI was expecting something along the lines of  an NYPD Pizza, since this is a local chain, but instead got a cool atmosphere and bad food.  The atmosphere just doesn't seem to fit the food and service vibe. It is also interesting to me that this location gets the lowest YELP score of the Humble Pies - hard to put your finger on it, but something just doesn't seem right.\n\nWe were super excited to have another spot coming to downtown phoenix, but won't be returning.\n\nIt's seat yourself when you walk in and the staff was not overly friendly at first. Once we were seated our 2nd day on the job waiter came over to take our orders.  He was friendly and got our girls some kids menus and crayons.  \n\nWe ordered 2 pizzas and  a bloody Mary. My husband got the Buffalo Chicken and said it was ok and I got the sausage which came with TONS of large onions.  I asked to have a new one since the menu didn't say anything about onions, he took it and then brought it back saying no,that just fennel...um no. But, whatever! So I just picked it off. The pizza was below average and our bill was $37 before tip for just the 2 pizzas and one drink - very over priced.\n\nOur waiter did say to the table just over from us, sorry about the wait - \""""It's a Hot Mess in here,or actually I am just a Hot Mess!\"""" Um Random!\n\nThey need to cleanup their act before this location closes"""""""

<review>This trendy bar is like Scottsdale.  If you are not in, you are out.  Simply a local bar with cliques.  We went there the tonight to celebrate our success\nand were treated coldly. at best.\nStay away from this pretentious wine bar.  It's too bad because the food was satisfying but the staff is very cliquish.  Go to Rokerj instead and have warm, friendly evening.  This is a bad place and don't be sucked in by the eclectic surroundings,  Especially stay away when the bartender Kim is on duty,  She is cold and very unfriendly and preoccupied with the other help instead of the patrons.  This place deserves to close as Scottsdale pretentiousness moves west because of high real estate cost.  Stay away with your attitude.

<review>"""I notified the owner of my issue directly and despite his tendency to respond to reviews online, I haven't received a response from him in over a week providing any apology or explanation so here it is...\n\nI cancelled my pest control service after a billing dispute.  I did this not because of the error, that happens, no big deal.  I cancelled because of the very rude attitude and customer service of the office staff.  In June I gave Probest my debit card number so they could just automatically deduct the monthly service from my account instead of writing a check each month.  I was charged in June and then double in July.  I called in to inform the staff of the double billing and they said they would have to call me back.  All of this was just a minor inconvenience up until this point.  Then Bonnie calls me back...\n\nI'll spare you the details of the conversation for brevity's sake however Bonnie proved to be quite incapable of handling the billing issue.  She seemed like an older lady with a southern drawl and genrally unpleasant attitude and seemed uncomfortable with their billing system and technology.  On our third go-round where she insisted I wasn't charged for June I told her in a firm (I stress I was NOT rude, yelling, cursing, etc... just firm) tone I was indeed charged in June and I expected it to be fixed.  This is where she turned from generally irritated and unhelpful to flat out argumentative and belligerent, yelling at me that it was my fault because I wasn't helping her enough.  I asked her calmly but firmly to please cancel my service and I would take up the issue with my bank.  She then hung up on me without saying another word.  I had to call back to confirm my service was in fact cancelled, she said she hung up on me because \once I said I wanted my service cancelled there was nothing more to discuss\"""".  \n\nRoughly a half hour later she calls me back and sheepishly says she found the charge for June. When I politely ask if an apology is in order for the way I was treated she absolutely refuses to apologize and starts arguing with me again!  She was going on about how much paperwork she had to go through to find the charge, as if I am the one responsible for the poor billing records.\n\nFor what it's worth the service itself was pretty average, the guys showed up and were nice enough, however I never really noticed a change in the scorpions I was looking to get rid of.  \n\nFinally, I'm NOT accusing Probest of impropriety but it is a general curiosity and coincidence that after several years of never having an issue with my bank/card that shortly after my dispute I had fraudulent charges on the same debit card I gave Probest."""""""

<review>Thanks for making my birthday dinner horrible! First, I would like to say that our waitress was courteous and very nice, but the food tonight was inedible! My hubby took me here for my birthday dinner, it was my favorite place and we have been coming here for 8 years. I ordered the lobster bisque and he ordered the clam chowder. Both soups were very very salty, but I was ok with that and ate half my soup. For the main course, he ordered the blackened catfish and I got the sea bass. My hubby took one bite of the fish and knew it was bad. I took a bite and yes it was very bad, not just bad in taste, but it tasted rank/sour. My sea bass was good, but what made me mad was that we told the waitress and she said she would have the manager come over and talk to us...... We waited and waited.... I ate my dinner alone while my hubby had nothing....... Finally the waitress came over and after two glasses of liquid courage, I gave her a piece of my mind. Evidently, that brought the manager over. My hubby didn't want to risk another choice from the menu and I was finished eating. They comped our meal, but that didn't make my birthday any better.... And Pappadeaux, no need to respond to my review because no apology is going to be good enough to have me dine in your establishment again.
</review>
<review>"""I thought I would have a chill evening with the boys. We have been waiting what feels like forever for this place to open! So we were so excited. Hubby's out o'town and we came up here. There was a crush so we decided to place a to-go order. As I was standing, ready and waiting to place my order, they fielded calls from people and took phone orders right in front of me. I could have called from my cell phone while standing there and been ahead of myself? So I end up placing my order and  I left and came back after 40 minutes (couldn't keep my kids calm in there that long) and they don't have my order. Poof. It had disappeared. An employee kept asking me for my phone number even after I told them I  had ordered it in person. I actually had to tell her to stop and listen to what I was saying. Finally the manger comes over and I came up with my receipt. The manager looks at it and keeps saying, \He rang it up wrong. This says delivery.\"""" (The person who helped me was female, so I have no idea who he is talking about.) Then the employee who took my order came over as the manager is about to hand me 2 salads. He read the receipt number incorrectly, she informs him I ordered a pizza. Then after a few clicks on the register he said to me, \""""I put your money back on your card.\"""" And he walks off. This paragon of communication says nothing else so I assume it was a dismissal and I head for the door. I had 3 hungry, tired boys and, apparently, I needed to go find food elsewhere. At this point it had been over an hour. I was trying to navigate the stroller out the door as the gal who took my order chased me out and promised to deliver it for free. I was afraid it would taste like sawdust just because I was so angry. Fast forward another half an hour...We get our pizza and I was trying to be objective. It was doughy because it was undercooked and the bottom was positively coated with corn meal so in turn it coated my tongue every time I took a bite. And looking at my bank account today, I see that the expansive loquacious manager did NOT reverse the charge. So I paid to wait almost 2 hours, listen to my kids whine, drive there twice, be ignored by employees, disrespected by  management only to finally be disappointed by the corn meal pizza. The garrulous manager probably refunded those people their salads. I hope they were better than my pizza. :("""""""

<review>This is my second time visitng since we live in the area.  The first time was average and the second and last time to visit was disgustingly unprofessional.  The overly loud and uninviting climate of the restaurant masks the distinguishing and historical architecture. I was very excited to be revisitng the place to discover more about it, but it all changed...\n\n  Most of all, the service was outright unprofessional and rude.  After making a huge attempt to go out of our way to be kind to the waiter, he just kept barking at us and insulted us.  This extremely angry person ruined every shred of your dignity.\n\nA plead to Hanny's management: i know most of your clientele are tourists, but to keep locals coming back, please hire persons who actually want to work there in the service industry.

<review>What the F, Chelsea's?\n\nWe've been coming here since day one, and I wouldn't call it our 'favorite' restaurant, but it's probably the restaurant we visit most frequently. Why? It's just so gosh-darn good, and very consistent. You can always find us at the bar--the bartenders are always beyond friendly, and we love looking out at their gorgeous patio and marveling at how they've covered up that nasty ass canal (DON'T HATE, we ride bikes on the canal, and that is a particularly gross patch). You can't go wrong starting off with the sangria, a glass of wine, or a margarita (one of the best in town), and I could close my eyes, blindly point to something on the menu, and be totally happy with whatever arrived. \n\nWhy did it suck so badly on our last visit? It was busy, although not any busier than usual on a Saturday night. We snagged a seat at the bar and after awhile the bartender handed us a sticky, ketchup-caked menu. No thanks. The bar surface wasn't any cleaner, so after about ten minutes I asked for a wet napkin and she finally took the hint and wiped our space down. Drinks were fine. The ceviche was so blah, I can't imagine any spice or lime went in to it. It tasted like a soupy bowl of tomatoes, and although this is one of our standbys, most of it went untouched. My husband's burger came out overcooked, as did my filet. Like, really overcooked. My green beans were soaked in butter and that was about it in the way of flavor--we asked our bartender for salt and pepper that never came.\n\nShe gave us a free dessert for our overcooked meals (thanks?), but I'd rather just have the old Chelsea's back.
</review>
<review>Oh, I hesitated before we entered this what seems to be a pretty highly rated yelp restaurant...\n\nThe only reason for 2 stars instead of a one  is a super friendly service.\nOur waiters were excellent, very helpful and accommodating. It is absolutely not their fault that food is mediocre. Actually, what was strange is that they charged our CC just the amount on the bill and did not include the tip my husband left. Bill was $26.40, my husband signed for $31, but online I see a charge of $26.40 only.  I don't know if I should call and make sure that waiters got their tip... I guess, I will do it on Monday.\n\nWe ordered pho chin ( well done brisket ). The broth was good, but nothing spectacular, brisket itself was still pretty chewy and tasteless. I expected it to be at least a little bit better, but if you are hungry and want something hot, go for it. The portion is very generous.\n\nVegetable Cha Gio (Fried Vietnamese egg rolls) was completely soaked in some oil, which totally ruined the dish. It looked like their fryer was not hot enough when they dipped rolls for cooking. Another possibility is that oil was old. Neither of the scenarios excites me.\n\nVermicelli with seasoned grilled shrimps disappointed as well. There were only 5 tiny shrimps on the top, pretty rubbery but tasty. The rest seemed to be 2 pounds of vermicelli.\n\nI don't know what everyone else with 5 star reviews ate there, but whatever we had was not that. I don't mind cheap, ethnic food, and I know that it can be inexpensive but still very good. \n\nI will not repeat, but I encourage you to try. Maybe, it was a bad day and you will get something better. Again, the service is very friendly, I kind of feel bad leaving such a negative review, but I cannot lie and led other people believe that the food was good.
</review>
<review>I have been here to eat twice and while the first experience was ok the second time\nhas me writing of the place for good. I will say the service was always speedy and quick both times but when we went to brunch the menu has better options like the chiliquiles.\n\n My problem is the limited menu during lunch time and the quality of that food. The table side guac was ok and some could say great if they prefer it one way more than another. I would say it wasn't close to Salty's but not terrible like America's taco shop on 7th st. There menu consist of two basic options excluding the soup during lunch, tacos and tortas. Their tortas remind me more of something you would find at a wildflower except without any good mixture of ingredients. you would think that if you only served 5 different things you would be really good. I don't mind a small amount of choices, even if you think of your own home rotation of meals you cook for your family you could limit it to your top 5 things and have a menu that would kick the crap out of most restaurant menus I am sure. I had the brisket torta which seemed to be a mix of a lox and a thin(super thin) layer of burnt beef. My girlfriend thought the same. My friend had another one that looked better but she said she wouldn't rush to come back for it. The side of beans were ok and the chorizo and potatoes were ok more for the potato side as the chorizo was semi bland and couldn't hold a candle to any Shreiner's offering.\n\nSo we had a 90$ lunch (no alcohol) that had faux latin food. When I went to brunch my girl did like the drinks and the chiliquiles are good but you could do better from any torta chain with little effort and just suffer from the ambiance for better food. Guero's tortas comes to mind but like I said even Subway could own these guys.

<review>I think I just don't like El Salvadoran food. It's either that or I accidentally consumed the cardboard and polymer display models in lieu of my actual entree. That was some seriously dry, bland food. Even tossing some watered down hot sauce on that pile of bland meat and carbs didn't really improve the edibility. I had the appetizer platter and the chicken with white rice and weird white sauce with a dry side salad. It was a bland, white platter of food. Plus, what's with the side salad of iceberg and radishes? Is it garnish? It's not dressed with anything and, you know, tastes just like a pile of lettuce. \n\nMaybe I'm just an ignorant prick. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I just don't like El Salvadoran (although I love just about everything else Central American). \n\nThe pupusas were crazy delicious though. I would totally return for these. (And only these.)

<review>A friend picked this place when we were visiting from out of town. The parking lot is pretty torn up and we actually were afraid it might not be open at first. The place is HUGE, but pretty much empty when we got there. They sat us at a table, but the waiter seemed pretty annoyed when we wanted to wait for the rest of our party to arrive before ordering drinks.  They wanted to rush our dinner order also which I don't understand considering how empty it was and the more laid back vibe I had been told to expect in comparison to NY. I might have ordered appetizers had I been given enough time to decide.\n\nI got a combo plate that had a cheese enchilada  and  chile releno. The sauce had a bit of a skin on it, but everything tasted OK for fast food Mexican standards. The corn tamale filling that they give a tiny scoop of is honestly the best thing on the plate. The rice was overcooked and hard. My husband had the same but added a beef taco that was just as unmemorable. One of our dining companions had a veggie fajita that turned out to be mostly potatoes and that seemed to be the most diet friendly thing on the menu. \n\nOverall, the food was edible which is more than you can say for alot of chain Mexican places. I was just hoping for a bit better considering we were vacationing in the southwest.

<review>Had my first experience at SanTan on a Friday night. The food was ok, the beer was mediocre. Our server was exceptional, wish I could remember his name. I think the thing that really turned me off was how HOT it was. It was miserable trying to eat, drink and be merry while you're near sweating on a cool Arizona night. For the money you're better off going to Four Peaks where the food is incredible and the beer is tasty!

<review>"""Call me a hater, but you all are brainwashed. \n\nEdit: changed my review to two stars to be a little more fair.\n\nI will start off by saying this is by far the best restaurant the Clarendon has had yet, though that isn't saying much considering their track record. The place is very unassuming and actually has a very comfortable feel. We were absolutely confused where to go when we walked into the restaurant. You can't tell where the bar ends and the dining room begins, and they don't have a set up hostess stand (the one they have is in the middle of the room) which you can easily find. Our hostess looked at us oddly for a couple of seconds before I let her know \were here for dinner......\""""\n\nAfter being seated, our server came over and we told her it was our first time and needed her help choosing. She described everything to sound absolutely delicious so we ordered away. I started out with the Picolo, a drink made with jalapeno, tequila, lime, and muddled seasonal fruit. Sounds delicious, but this is where the night took a turn for the worst. I took a taste and just about dropped my glass and my head twitched.... it was so tart it was undrinkable. I'm a guy who likes my sour candy and sour anything, but this was almost painful to drink. I told the server and she started laughing and apparently assumed I was kidding??? \n\nI ordered three tacos, and a side of rice. I first tried the Cochinita, which I have to say was an absolutely butchered dish. Does this white boy need to go over and give lessons to you people about how to properly cook a Mexican dish? YOU DO NOT PUT GUACAMOLE ON COCHINITA PIBIL. You also don't used tough, chopped pork. You use shredded and slow roasted pork. You don't put chunks of fruit in it either. You ruined one of the greatest Mexican dishes of all time. The Carne Asada had a wonderfully textured and tender quality, but fell flat on it's face when it came to flavor, of which it had none. I tried the Ahi Tuna taco as well, which also was covered in guacamole. You can't just cover all of your food in guacamole and pass it as mexican, unless you are trying to hide a lack of skill in the kitchen. I ate my \""""guacos\"""" (not tacos) begrudgingly. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the guacamole and proclaimed it to be completely average, but I'd have to say otherwise. I took a bite on a chip only to find a big chunk of orange slice. Really? People order this, and then come back and order it again? This is actually the second Mexican dish you've managed to butcher, after the cochinita pibil. I won't even start on the rice, which was not cooked properly, was covered in cilantro... and I mean COVERED, and was borderline cold. \n\nService here is good enough, but I had the feeling the whole time that our server was simply going through the motions. When she laughed and told me she was glad I liked the drink I was complaining about, all the way to the end when she asked why we didn't finish the guacamole and couldn't understand why we weren't licking the bowl, she just flat out was off. \n\nThe meal was absolutely a bastardization of the Mexican cuisine. You all are trying to damned hard to be \""""cute\"""" and made yourself look like inexperienced buffoons in the kitchen. I have to tell you that this place is probably only surviving because it caters to a niche and because some yelp superstar decided they like it, and all their sheep friends followed. If this place had to survive on it's own in the real world (outside it's \""""I'm to hip to go anywhere that cool people wont see me\"""" atmosphere) it would fall flat on it's face, just like every other restaurant this hotel has dreamt up."""""""

<review>I lived here for 15 months and it was living hell! I moved out weeks ago and I'm still dealing with their --------! First of all the office management is terrible! MINDY is not helpful what-so-ever, they will not give my deposit back because of fees she cannot even explain, they even wrote the wrong date when correcting my lease! I have to constantly call and I never received a call back. The apartment itself is cheap! My dishwasher broke, carpets are disgusting, cabinets falling off the ceiling, closet doors break....\nA neighbor of mine DIED and they did not recover him for almost a month and expected his neighbor to live there still with the smell of a decomposing body in his apartment, and never once reimbursed him for rent! Management simply wants your money and does not care one bit about your satisfaction. They are rude and unprofessional,  and  will create charges just to get your money. \n\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE \n\nRead more: http://www.apartmentratings.com/rate/AZ-Phoenix-Colonnade-Gardens-Apartment-1423915.html#ixzz1sDuNXSCQ

<review>Nice atmosphere , a lot of German in this place. However the food was a disappointment. Beef Roulade was tasty, but meat was dry. Weiner Schnitzel was a dried out slab of meat, breaded and possibly laying on a plate in the kitchen for a while. Precooked and then reheated. Not freshly fried for sure. No additional lemon based gravy, made for a super dried out experience. Potatoes were too mushy. Apfel Strudel was very good, but obviously over hot from a microwave 'heat-up' before serving.  We don't need to go back. We did love the accordian and tuba players, they were great!  PS, I am German and I know my german food!

<review>As far as Cummings effectiveness against bugs in the house, I'm neither here nor there. We have a contract for them to come out every 2 months. We still have our ant problem and we still get bugs in the house. The annoying thing for me is the bug guy who stops by our house 2- 3 hours before our scheduled appointment time. Is it better than being late? I'm not so sure it is. The bug guy calls and leaves messages on our voicemail that he is at our house and wants to treat the house sooner (of course it always a time that is not convenient for me). When I explained to the scheduling lady the concept of an appointment (which is I schedule a time that works for me and they schedule a time that works for them/bug guy), I was told they would speak to him about arriving early. Now he just waits in our driveway until I get home. Perhaps I am being paranoid but the guy gives me the creeps! As soon as our contract is up, it will be 'Smell you later, Cummings!!'

<review>Wow.  Because of this review, Piece of Cake Desserts have become somewhat defensive.  Very Polite, but defensive.  I've already received two follow up emails from the owners.  \n\nI'm sure it was the 'too busy for your business' , with no other reason that was a bit off-putting.  \n\nMaybe the situation and referral could have been handled better.  Instead of, 'we're too busy for your business, call so-and-so'.  Maybe this would have worked;  'Hello, my name is so-and-so from so-and so bakery, we helping Piece of Cakes Desserts through the Fathers Day weekend rush.  We would be more than happy to talk about making a cake for your special occasion'.  Hey, Just an example. \n\nSo, water..bridge, as they say.  And on to the next thing!

<review>"""Hey now, let's watch that young energetic staff at Fakefathers dump those \great\"""" fries out of their respective bags into the oil (that includes the sweet potato variety). Now, let's watch the cook take inferior meat that has already been chopped up and is waiting in bins and dump it onto the grill with the pre-cut and measured onions and peppers and voila your sandwich is ready in 2.5 minutes. I want my freakin steak to start red and get cooked on the grill you idiots.  Ok, now let's pay $8 for a tiny sandwich that uses SIRLOIN steak, not ribeye and be happy about life. Nah, let's just call this place what it is:  a ripoff, a place that uses cheap ingredients to make a profit on the poor customers of Phoenix, who don't ask questions and assume because they throw alot of cheap meat into the bun, it must be worth the price. \n    Some folks take cheesesteak seriously and no lazy establishment is getting my cash these days. There was nothing to these sandwiches. no flavor and using sirloin is basically the equivalent of buying a pack of Steak-umm's and making these yourself at home.

<review>Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur. \n\nThis is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but that's all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have.\n\nIf you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand. \n\nTiny servings.\n\nThe good. Friendly wait staff.\n\nIf authentic Thai is what you're looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill.

<review>Food-wise, I think this place may have deserved 2 stars. I'm from the Bay Area, and the Thai food there is delicious!\n\nThe coconut soup wasn't what i expected-- the taste was okay, though a bit watery. I liked the lemongrass in it.  then we had Rama's Favorite, which was basically beef with peanut sauce. more like peanut butter-- the peanut was overpowering. \n\nthe WORST part was the food poisoning-- both my fiance and i subsequently got vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. i even had to bring him to the ER, it was so bad. I see Thai Basil is generally well reviewed here on Yelp, so maybe it was just an off day? but just warning you-- something we ate there was bad, and I think it was the Rama's Favorite.

<review>If you value your privacy, this is a place to avoid.  This place offers NO privacy, even though I was told to sit down while filling out my forms due to privacy.\n\nI went in for a sinus infection - I don't live in Phoenix but I was working here - and showed up at 8am along with two other people.  Of the others, one was there due to a work injury and the other was trying to scam an Oxycontin prescription.\n\nHow do I know this?  The walls between the examination room can't be thicker than a human hair.  I had my intake done (heart rate, blood pressure, etc) behind a curtain, and instead of having me fill out a form detailing my health history, I was required to recite it.  \n\nAfter some VERY personal questions (it's my sinuses, NOT my plumbing!) the interviewer asked if I have a health power of attorney or a living will.\n\nUm... just how bad IS the service here?\n\nThen I was put in an exam room with plywood for walls.  Grimy ones, with a thin verneer that hasn't been washed in a LOOOOONG time.  At that point I first got to listen to the fella who had the work injury and the guy who insisted after having an accident four months ago (!) he was still in pain and needed... y'know... something a little stronger... than, well, Vicodin.  \n\nUh, huh.  The doctor, who was quite nice, gave the junkie a prescription for naproxen sodium (Aleve).  Bummer for him.\n\nAfter seeing me, he not only gave me the antibiotics I requested, he gave me a prescription for the pain that contains codeine (??  What's that about?), Flonase (for a cold?) and a cough syrup (I don't have a cough).  Whatever.\n\nBottom line:  there has to be somewhere better than this.

<review>Eh, uh, Meh.\n\nI get excited whenever my priceline offer is accepted and I get placed in a Hyatt. This one is my least favorite Hyatt locations. I won't complain about the typical parking charges and internet fees that always occur at 4 star hotels (even though the restaurant/bar downstairs is called freaking NETWORKS! duh). \n\nHowever.....the thermostats are waaaay outdated and don't work that well, can't open a window, awkward check in - they now have a self check in computer (like airline ticketing) but the desk lady still takes your DL and credit card and runs them through the machine....standing on your side of the desk. Just kinda awkward. \n\nYes, the elevators are neat and fast and the views are cool, but CLEAN THEM. No excuse for those things to not have the snot-nosed kid handprints wiped clean a few times a day. The employees ride them too, right? \n\nI got a beer at Networks, downstairs. 1 beer = $6.01 + tip (not sure why I did tip) = $7.01. FOR 1 BEER. \n\nWanted to watch the Dbacks game.....neither front desk nor concierge could tell me how to navigate my remote away from the corny adult movie ads to normal TV, or tell me what channel it would be on. \n\nAbout that thermostat.....mine didn't work. Called front desk, they sent someone up. Took 45 minutes, but they fixed it at least. I'm just used to outstanding service with Hyatt, 45 minutes for a fix-it visit is too long. \n\nIt is modern, beds are comfy(as expected), you can see the Dbacks stadium from your room, just BYOB and hope you don't need help from the staff. \n\n2 stars on a Hyatt scale. I'd give them 4 if it were another hotel that I nabbed for $70 on priceline.....

<review>I'm sure Dr. Gentile is a fine doctor and a good person but when when my husband and I were interviewing pediatric offices I found Dr. Gentile to be annoyed by our questions about alternative shot schedules and he stated that they only follow the APA's vaccine schedule and then he proceeded to tell me what horrible things might happen to my baby should we not follow the schedule. \n\nI understand that vaccines are important but we chose a different pediatric office because we live an organic lifestyle and chose to go with a variation of Dr. Sears' shot schedule (our kiddos do get all of the shots, just more spread out), and this other office was willing to work with us. Dr. Gentile's office was just not right for us.

<review>This is a 2ish-to-3ish-back-to-2ish star kind of joint. Doesn't get more Americanized Chinese than this - your sweet  and  sour chicken, your Mongolian beef, your walnut prawns....and you realize you're the only one in a packed restaurant at lunchtime actually eating with chopsticks (given upon request). The few times been here for lunch the food has been nominal. Decent but nothing that stayed with me, except that typical post Chinese-lunch craving for a massive nap. \n\nService...well, depends on the server. Some are friendly, some not so much. Prices for the lunch special hover around $5.50 and include egg flower or hot  and  sour soup, entree, fried rice, and the greasiest egg roll that ever egg rolled. \n\nChinatown this isn't, but Grandma Ethel would love it. Actually make that plural Grandma Ethels. They were all over, rockin the place.

<review>"""As previous reviewers have stated, the course is an expensive but beautiful place to play. Those who greeted us when we arrived and left displayed impeccable service.\n\n..so, why the two stars? I suppose it's unfair, but a fact of life, that an experience is remembered not by how much went right, but how much went wrong. Our foursome came to the golf course after a long conference, expecting an opporunity to unwind, talk business, and enjoy some fun after a few days of work. It appears we were scheduled to play ahead of two scratch threesomes. We fell about a hole behind those in front of us, and had planned to start letting those behind us play through at the 1st par 3 opportunity on the Raptor course.\n\nRight before we got to the first par 3, we were accosted by the rangers. No polite request to speed up play, or to let those behind us play through. Instead, we were critiqued for our slowness of play, and the trouble we were causing those behind, and if we \planned to speed up\"""", as if we were playing slow purposefully. \n\nSo, we allowed the 1st 3-some behind us pass through.. and immediately on the next hole, were accosted by the very same rangers! Now, we could still see the 3-some we just let pass through teeing off on the hole ahead of us, and yet we were accosted for our slow play.\n\nSo, regardless of the service we received coming and leaving, regardless of the beautiful vistas, all I remember when I think of this golf course is our discourse with the ranger, which is a shame."""""""

<review>Growing up in Arizona I remember the days when this place had a lot going for it. Recently, I ventured back on a visit back home and was less then impressed. It would seem that whoever is managing this place now cares more about what the place looks like then whether or not there is actually anything worthy of shopping or eating at. The slide has been so bad here that I fear it will become a ghost town if the economy gets any worse. Before long it won't be worth the rent for the few retailers that are left occupying it. Shame...

<review>After years of living away from the McDowell Mountain Ranch area, decided to try Nick's again...It used to be a favorite of mine.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  First off, our table was given cold bread.  -  Not room temperature bread, but COLD.  Next, the food was only so-so...I had the spaghetti  and  meatballs.  The spaghetti was ok, the sauce not so great, and the meatballs were totally dry.  My partner ordered the pizza.  The crust was on the thicker side, and the sauce too sweet and very greasy.  \n\nThe worst part was the service.  We were on the fence about ordering dessert, when our waitress came and quickly dropped off the check....rushing us out.  Not only that but, the owner was getting the table ready next to us, and we overheard him saying to get us out of there because they needed to use our table for a bigger party.  \n\nTerrible...will never go back.

<review>"""Wow, Monkey Pants, you really let me down.  I've heard so many great things, from Yelp and from friends, and I couldn't wait to check this place out.  I finally did, and was honestly very surprised at how much I didn't like this place.\n\nSo the basics... you can usually get 2 out of 3 on service, price, and quality.  Well the service sucked.  The waitress was literally angry we were there.  The prices were ok.  Quality?  When your coke doesn't taste like coke (we're talking about soda here), the lemonade doesn't taste like lemonade, and the nachos seem like they've been prepared a few hours ago... not my place.\n\nThe decor confused me.  It seemed like they wanted to try for a sports restaurant, with a ton of TVs, but the TVs were fighting with the grandma's living room section.  I didn't feel the vibe, in fact I felt the desire to go home.\n\nThey have a free comedy show on Thursday nights as well.  The MC kept reminding us that you get what you pay for, but he must have been lying because they didn't pay me to sit through it.  Just about nothing offends me, but these \comedians\"""" had offense on lock.  Jokes about rape and abortion, one after another, and nobody was laughing - time to give it up."""""""
</review>
<review>I walk in to get seated, and it took about 15 minutes for the waitress to get our drink order.  I ordered chicken wings...an hour later (no joke, literally an hour), the wings came out and i ate 4 of them. My friend told me to look down on my plate. As i look down, it looked like the chicken had been murdered, yes, they were bloody and raw. Im not saying I wasn't a dumb@$$ for not looking at chicken while i eat it, but damn. I told the waitress and she took them off the bill, a small compensation for what ensued later that night. About 5 hours later, i get home from work, and i start crapping and puking simultaneiously. This went on for 8 hours. I called the doctor to see if im going to die, he said possibly... and to keep slamming water. So i did, i kept myself awake out of fear of death in my sleep by dehydration. So all in all, if you're looking to lose some lbs by crapping out your intestines and other non important organs, Turf is the place to be.

<review>I had been meaning for a while to this place out and finally did since it is hard to pass up The Main Ingredient. I wish I hadn't as not more than 50 feet from where I sat people where most likely enjoying some awesome appetizers and good food for way less.\n\nI tried the wings which had an odd taste but were so so. The antipasto board was terrible and for 11$ should have had a little effort to it. The food came slow as well as the service was slow and inattentive. The lady we had seemed to not be thinking about the place since we had to request a pizza to go 3 times she came back out from the back. I must note that at the time there were 2 people at the bar and one other couple in the whole place. The steak and turkey chili was pretty bad also. \n\n I am not a fan of pizza much besides maybe Red Devil or the now closed Western Pizza but I live with 3 females that are and not one of them cared for it. The bread was good but the sauce had the hint of toothpaste( probably from too much tomato paste) that peter piper seems to have in their equally terrible pizza. \n\n I can't say I will be back, I think my girl liked the martini she had but she will have to go alone if she wants another.\n\nI would mention that just like a terrible steak house or a Chili's you will pay more than you should for sub par dining. I don't mind paying well for good food but you can't help feeling like you have been ripped off when you have a larger than average bill for crappy food.

<review>"""Was here for NYE and my birthday celebration, bf explained it was my bday upon making reservation.  It was a little more casual than expected but that was fine.  Server Laura, with long blonde hair and big silver circle earrings took her time getting us started.  We ordered a bottle of champagne on the menu and she said I don't know if we have that.  Then she proceeded to flip through our menu on the table to see what they had, clearly unfamiliar with their offerings.  Hmm. NYE you would think you would know what bubbly you have..just sayin'.....She then brought a tiny bottle of sparkling sake and my bf politely asked, \Um, is that champagne?\""""  She looked at it then realizing her mistake, rushed off to get what we ordered and said it was my mistake and the bar's.\n\nWe started with a tuna and poke appetizer which was good, it had truffle oil and served on tortilla chips which was a nice crunchy contrast.  The sauce was really sweet and almost too much as you could barely taste the truffle oil even though you could smell it.  Next the tuna in the spicy tuna roll was brown(?) and not spicy, must have been with a mild soy sauce, and accompanied by only cucumber inside.  This was my least favorite.  The rainbow roll was good and what we expected, albacore sashimi was good but not the best I have had.  Sunshine roll had tuna with a mango sauce that was a refreshing fruit sauce to the palate since most of our rolls were sweet, salty, and or creamy/rich.  The baked scallop roll was okay, too much mayo in the overcooked scallops and was drenched in eel sauce.  The creamy baked lobster roll was the best, with lobster tempura on top of the roll with eel sauce.  Lobster was cooked just right.  \n\nI really wanted a lava cake for my bday but she said they were out which was disappointingly surprising since it was early, like 9:30 ish.  So we said we didn't need anything else (code for \""""you can bring the check\"""")  but still waited for the bill. No luck so I put my coat on as a hint. Still nothing so we started looking around as a sign and even had bf put his bright red debit on the table for her to see...still waiting.  Finally had bf take his card to her.  Sub par service considering the restaurant was not even full and she clearly wasn't busy.  Food was good but not memorable.  Service below average and unlikely to return.  She never even wished me happy birthday."""""""

<review>Huge selection of wine, booze and beer along with other bar/party type items. Snack food is really overpriced. My biggest complaint about this place is the lack of good craft beer that is kept cold. They have a big selection but 98% of it sits on a warm store shelf where it can go bad fast.  For my money I'd rather shop for beer at AJ's, Sun Devil, Tops or Papago but for wine and booze Bevmo is more than adequete.Prices can also be surprisngsly higher than their competitors.

<review>My husband and i went here early evening on Saturday (about 5:45pm). The place is very close to where we live and wanted to give it a shot. There was only 3 other tables that were occupied so we were seated right away. Our table had a balance issue that my husband solved by placing a napkin under one of the legs. The place was tastefully decorated, nothing too special. \n\nWe were greeted right away by our server and were informed about the happy hour specials that were still good until 6pm. I quickly ordered a wine flight for each of us ($2 off each flight) and an appetizer of chicken satay with pineapple salsa ( $8). We received our wines and they were all very delicious. I had the chardonnay flight ( $10) and the husband had the merlot flight ($12). \n\nThen the appetizer came. It was 3 skewers of chicken planted into a thick slice of grilled pineapple and a side of the salsa. I tried to take a bite of it and it was too chewy. I used my fork to slide it off the skewer and ended up getting a work out. This was way overcooked and way overseasoned. We had to put plenty of the sweet salsa on the chicken to balance out the amount of salt that was used for the chicken. So...not impressed with the satay.\n\nFor the entree we ordered the blackened salmon with risotto and veggies. They were out of risotto so we chose the goat cheese mashed potatoes instead. The salmon had a good flavor but was overcooked and the mashed potatoes were very good, even though I would have never knew that there was goat cheese in there. The server came over and told us that since we were sharing that if we wanted more veggies to let her know, my husband said sure I will have some. She ended up bringing out some weird stir fry veggies which did not come with the original meal ( we had steamed veggies) and we were charged $4 extra for these when the bill arrived. She really misled us, I thought she was OFFERING them. \n\nWe ordered the chocolate crepe with fresh fruit and creme fresh for desert ($8).The crepe was horrible in flavor and texture. The berries and creme that were inside were delicious.\n\nThe wine here is reasonable, and there are not many places in the westside that have this type of selection. i may go back for the wine...and that is it. The food did not impress me at all and I am so glad that the husband and I shared the plates we did get. This is usually what we do when we go for the first time to a place that is a little pricey. That way if the food is bad we do not spend so much. \n\nThis place may have some food that could be good, but I am not willing to take that chance. I would like to see a little more quality in the food here than what we received. I mean I have had better chicken satay at a backyard BBQ.
</review>
<review>"""We had high hopes for this place.  Rave reviews (mostly), and personal recommendations.  Heck, if you don't have a reservation you probably aren't getting in!  What a disappointment.  Even with the reservation we had to wait about 15 minutes.  Menu looked appetizing.  Sounded very up-scale!  \n\nI had the salmon.  If you can call it that.  The actual salmon was microscopic.  A tiny piece perhaps 2\ square by about 1/2\"""" thick.  That's it.  The rest was \""""greens\"""".  Apparently they expect you to fill up on \""""greens\"""".  And the flavor of that miniscule bit of salmon was just ordinary.  Nothing special.\n\nOne person had a sandwich.  It was small, but bigger than the salmon.  It was reasonably tasty.  At least as good as Quiznos.  But, again, nothing special.\n\nAlso, you have to ask for bread service.  It's complimentary, but if you don't ask you don't get.  And the bread wasn't even warm.\n\nThe lemonade was really sub-par.  Not good.  The one bright spot was that their apricot tea is really outstanding.\n\nIf you like salads and \""""greens\"""", you might like this place.  The person we went with had been there before, and she loved her strawberry salad.  But even she commented that the portion size had shrunk (she had never finished a whole serving before, but this time she did).  The other two salad-eaters in the group weren't as impressed (they didn't get the strawberry salad, though).\n\nOverall...I'd skip this place.  Drop in and buy the tea (they sell it in leaf form), but skip the food.  Overpriced, undersized, and nothing special on the flavor front."""""""

<review>I just wanted to say out of all the hotels in the valley I chose Sheraton Wild Horse Pass for  me and my wife to stay the night and celebrate on the joyous occasion for New Years Eve.  It was very disturbing saying the very least when the fire alarm went off around 4 a.m. in our wing and immediately we jumped from a dead sleep.  As I proceeded into the hallway people were looking at each other saying is this a false alarm without knowing what to assume.  I personally felt systems should of been in place to where the management staff should of been there conveying whether to get out of the building or it is simply a false alarm.  Think we both can agree moments in a real fire can have serious and disastrous consequences.  After the alarm stopped we were way too alert to even thing about falling back to sleep so needless to say we left after 4:45 this morning.  Personally don't think it was worth the $166.88 when it pertains to personal safety.\n\nDo think out of all the casino hotels in the valley Talking Stick Resort is the best as well as being close to all the ammenities in Scottsdale.  \n\n\n  Leonard W Payne\n  Reservation Number #095468391

<review>Food was okay, but nothing to remember.  The portabello crab cake appetizer was a disappointment as we didn't notice any crab in there.  The steak we ordered was not that good as it seemed like it was precooked, then reheated.  The beef in my Beef and British Ale Pie tasted like the beef sirloin you get in Campbell's Chunky soup, even though it is immersed in sauce, it is somehow dry and bland.  Only redeeming qualities are the beer selection and fries.

<review>Save yourself from unnecesary restaurant pain and go somewhere else for real Mexican food.  I usually don't do restaurant bashing but sometimes it's just a guys civic duty.  This place is like somebody in Switzerland's idea of a real southwest Mexican restaurant.  The place is cavernous with decour ala Taiwan import company.  The food is bland and you could probably find more authenticity eating Stouffers.  Margarita's are overpriced but OK.  How can you screw up a margarita?  Besides that it's a great place for another restaurant.

<review>No stars!\n\nMy wife and I were looking for something different in Glendale \\ Peoria area.  Lots of the usual chains here, and since we had never been in Firebirds, we might as well try it.  Mistake\n\nIt wasn't that busy and we were told by the door holder (can't call her a hostess since she was no host) said to sit anywhere.  We waited 15 minutes just to get the waitress to come take drink orders.  Not a good start.\n\nOur Queso with Chips was cold when it came out.  Our meals were bland, greasy bar food.  My ribs tasted like they were bought from Safeway.  And service continued to be ridiculously poor.\n\nYelp makes me give it a star, which it doesn't deserve.  Spending $60 for dinner for 2 and having it be this bad an experience deserves no stars  \n\nDo not waste your time at this poor excuse for a sports bar.  There are many better choices.

<review>We brought home Serrano's takeout for dinner to feed the 5 of us.  Some observations:\n\n- The food is way overpriced; for example, a cheeseburger plate was $7.50 and grilled cheese is $5.  While these aren't Mexican dishes (they were for the kids), this is sky-high even for restaurant standards\n\n- The side dishes are tiny -- my portion of rice and beans was absolutely lacking\n\n- The carne asada tacos were decent, but could have been more flavorful; including a lime definitely would have helped the cause\n\nAs there are many other, better, and more authentic places to get Mexican food in the East Valley, search elsewhere.

<review>I am being very generous here, because the expectations were so much higher. They jam packed us among a heard in the middle of the room. They couldn't  remember whose drink was whose and they brought my girlfriends meal out wrong, oh yeah, and it was her birthday. Well I just dropped the rating again, just remembering the experience we had. Then as they went back to fix her meal again, they just let mine sit out in front of me and get cold, cause you know if I started eating before her, not a good idea. When they finally brought her meal, we told them that mine wasn't hot anymore so they went back and nuked it, nuked it, I am paying $150+ for the 2 of us. Oh hell no!!! So we choked down our meals which were all right, I have had better. No apologies, no manager apologies, nothing. Might not ever go back!!!!!

<review>"""This is not about the Phoenix location but Avis in general...\n\nWhile traveling from Phoenix to Sedona we had a flat tire in our rental. This was Sunday, July 15th, late afternoon. We needed a drivable car first thing Monday morning. I called the number on the paperwork and spoke with Ryan. He said he would work on getting a car to our hotel in Sedona and call back in 5 minutes. We waited in 100+ degrees temperatures in the sun. We then procedded to walk up a hill to the visitors' center of the Nat'l Park Service. I called and talked with Nathan. Same thing, he would help me. Nathan was able to find our rental information by name as I'd inadvertently left the paperwork back in the car. Nathan said will call back. Waited and no call back from either. I called and talked with Floyd. He started to take the info but had the wrong Robert Kerr. He needed the reservation number (back down the hill in the sun and heat). I mentioned Nathan was able to locate the account and his response was: \Well good for Nathan.\"""" I asked him to check another Robert Kerr and he said there were too many and he could not help without the reservation number. I asked for a supervisor and was put on hold for 10+ minutes. Concerned that with the previous attitude difficulties that I was being ignored with no hopes of being able to reach a supervisor and a cell phone with a low battery + sketchy cell phone coverage. I called and got Ryan who was helpful. He pulled up the account right away without the reservation number. I asked how many Robert Kerrs there were and he said three. I asked if there were any notes on the account and he said yes with the last being Floyd's (who couldn't be bothered looking up three accounts. Ryan resolved the problem and we received a replacement car that evening. We used AAA to change to the spare as Avis could not find our location."""""""

<review>"""This is the worst Paradise Bakery I have been too. Mike and I came here last Friday night primarily to get some chicken noodle soup since he was feeling under the weather. \n\nWe get here and immediately someone tells us that this has been the night from hell and that they are out of a lot of stuff. Ok, thank you for welcoming me into your establishment. \n\nWe asked for a club and were told that the croissants were cooling. Ok, how long until they are ready? Response, \I don't know. A loooong time. But we can get it for you if you wait, but not if you are getting a to go order.\"""" So no croissants for us. I wanted a panini. Only one was available even though three were listed online for the menu for this location. They were out of one kind and I was told that they didn't offer the other even though it was listed as an option online. Fine, I took the only one they had. I then went to get a mixed greens salad and they were out of mixed greens and tomatoes. Who knows what else they were out of that we didn't ask for. \n\nAll the kids who were working here looked miserable to have to be explaining this to customers and be put in this situation.

<review>Visited Sunflower last night in search of Scharffen Berger chocolates.  Nay on SB chocs, but you may find organic (Green  and amp; Black's, Love, Newman's Own, etc.) in the impulse buy sections.  I sampled a peanut milk chocolate cluster and an almond chocolate cluster at the bulk section and decided I'd get some peanut ones.  I already had a plastic bag open and was about to jot down the item number on a label twisty-tie when I spotted something moving at the corner of my eye... I lifted the peanut chocolate cluster bin lid to have a look, and there was a 1/2- inch maggot doing its dance on one of the bin's walls!!  I dropped the lid shut, stared at the bugger to see if I wasn't just seeing things, lifted the lid back up and pinched it off the bin's wall with the plastic bag in hand, and handed the bag to a clerk and told him where I found it.  The manager on duty was close by so I repeated everything that transpired to her.  She said she'd empty and sanitize the bin immediately.  I didn't hang around to see if she did anything.\n\nUgh!  I'm getting shivers up and down my spine typing this just now!!  \n\nBTW, I had a look into the freezer aisles a few weeks ago to have a look at the Berto gelato selections and they ALL have a horrible case of freezer burn.  Looks like a pretty low turnover rate...  I'll try to see if Sunflower still carries Laloo goatmilk ice cream, but, honestly, I can't see myself going there anytime soon after the maggot incident...\n---\nUpdate: Just recalled that Sunflower never sold Laloo... I found Laloo's goatmilk ice cream at Whole Foods and AJ's Fine Foods.  Sorry for misleading!

<review>My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night jazz night once and I've been here a couple of times for coffee. I really want to love this place but I just can't get into it. Each time I've been I haven't been moved by the coffee drinks and the veggie lavash pizza I had for dinner was just okay. \n\nThe ambiance is great and I love the location. I just feel it's a little overpriced and the market holds very few things I couldn't find at Trader Joe's/Sprouts for a better price.\n\nI can definitely see the appeal. Nice  and  healthy. I've been meaning to try their breakfast. Perhaps that will win me over...

<review>Came here for a group dinner, and wasn't impressed with the food menu. Granted its Chinese multi-course dinner, but there wasn't much flavor in anything. The soup was okay (its difficult to mess up soup), and the soda was fine, but everything else was just so bland. The waiters were quick to bring everything out and clean up the table, but nothing memorable stood out in the dining experience. The drinks at the bar were watered down and weren't nearly worth the $6 price tag, as cheap as that is.

<review>"""Made a return trip this past week because my buddy raved over his chicken dish he got here a year ago(seriously. he went into the kitchen after the meal and thanked the cook). No dice this time. Us being a group of four rolled into this joint without a reservation hoping to get seated. Imagine our delight when we walk into a place with less than half the tables occupied. The host went over to the bartender after we spoke with him and we got the look. You know the look. It's an over the shoulder glance of disgust and \not these people\"""". The host returned and told us a 1 hour wait. I believe my half buzzed response was no way or something to that effect. The wife pointed towards the plethora of empty tables and we were told those were reservations. Immediately I called Guinness Book because this place had to be near setting a record for reservations. We mosied on over to another establishment that probably blows this one out of the water. You get 1 star because I have to give you one and another for the grub my buddy had last year."""""""

<review>This Safeway is ghetto...for Arizona.  There are always security guards hanging around and looking creepy, like maybe they stole the uniforms.  This store is always understaffed and usually only has one or two checkout lanes open when there are 20 people in line.  None of the employees are helpful nor friendly.  The products are all grossly overpriced.  I did a Fresh and Easy comparison in terms of price of a recent trip there and Safeway was a little over double the cost of F and E!  Yikes.  This is a terrible location.  All Safeways are terrible actually.  I don't like paying double and getting half the customer service I get anywhere else.  No thank you!

Our drinks were not maintained and when we had issue concerning our meal our server told us it would be a while before we could get another order of pancakes, without an apology. \n\nWe had the chicken and waffles, which were ok ~ the chicken was nice and crisp but was a little over done. The waffle was flat and plain. We also had pancakes with sides of bacon and sausage. The pancakes were cold for some reason so we wanted to order some fresh but our server was not helpful. The bacon was very good as was the sausage.  We also had the Wolfpack, which was very good with two eggs, bacon and cheese between layers of crisp buttery hashbrownie goodness. Very filling but not something to order if your watching your carb in take. \n\nI hope you listen to the Yelpers and make some changes soon.  There are too many other places to dine for breakfast and lunch that are as good if not better than you now.

<review>I have eaten in, and done delivery now. So...eating in, pretty darn good. Passion bread is a perk, and the pizzas are great. Wings, not bad. Delivery...something bad happens on the way to the drop site. I think, well my boyfriend and I hypothesize, that since they bake their wings/boneless wings, they aren't as crispy. But maybe, during the drive over, they get even more soggy.  I predict there are better places to get delivery wings on a Sunday Funday football game dinner. But make up your own mind...

<review>Went in to get my radiator checked because it was leaking. Estimate came back at $911. $285 for labor, which would have been acceptable if they were charging a fair price for parts. For new radiator and fan, seal and hoses. I called my brother a mechanic and he said I was being gouged! Radiator $100, Fan assembly $110, tSeal, upper and lower hoses. Midas is charging double what this job should have cost! This should be a 2 hour job and they charge for 4 +. They over charged me for an oil change and I went on my way to get the work done elsewhere. I used to get my oil changed here religiously as its close to home. I won't be back! They charged me for the estimate, but were ashamed to leave their price tag on it!

<review>I am a little hesitate about writing a review about this place because the stylist there are nice to me. I went there several times to get my eyebrows waxed and hair cut and flat ironed. There were times were they did good and times were they messed up pretty bad. I went in to get my eyebrows waxed and the lady made one of my eyebrow long and one short. The other time I went in she waxed so many times that I had skin peeling.One stylist has messed up on my highlights and made it to blonde in different sections and had to get it fixed. I got my hair burned because they used a strong flat iron I asked the stylist what is that smell while she was flat ironing my hair she said she didn't know and the other stylist were sitting there and didn't say anything to my response. I don't understand how you can stand there and not smell that my hair was burning? I trusted them and thought nothing of it till I came home. and then the manger had to use a condition treatment on my hair and when I went a second time the owner was there and she used a stronger conditioning treatment even when I told her that's not what the manger used and when I called the manger she went on by saying that maybe it was to much protein in my hair because after two treatment I was to see better results on my burned hair and did not. I don't understand what kind of owner they have there that wouldn't even listen to me when I said that's not what the manger used. I called to manager on what to do next she said that she would call the owner and get back to me and never did. They didn't seem to want to listen to the customers needs and they seem like they were helping me by doing the conditioning treatment but they should have gave me my money back.  I will not go back there. I don't trust this place

<review>I have to say, I went to a lot of different Hooter's establishments throughout the 1990s, when I was in military. It was the natural place to go when you're a bunch of young, low-income guys being shipped around from place to place. But I hadn't been to one in at least 10 years.\n\nI was expecting it to be worse, because I've heard these stories about how they'll get sued now if they fire their waitresses for getting fat, but I had no idea how pussified this place had become. Hooter's used to be a chain of bars where guys go to watch football games and have hot chicks bring them beer. Not anymore. There was a table of 6 chatty 50-something yentas sitting next to us, there were children running around, and the waitress talent seems to have suffered. Then we get seated at a gross-ass table, had a pretty long wait before the waitress came by, and another long wait before it got wiped down, and I just wanted to get out of there.\n\n1 extra star because a balcony on 5th  and  Mill is a good thing, though I'd go to Gordon Biersch (mediocre in its own right) over this place every time.
</review>
<review>Romanelli's makes a good sandwich, I admit. But other than that, I don't see many redeeming qualities.\n\nThe two stars is for the fact that they appear to pass off fake Parmigiano-Reggiano as the real thing (check the rinds -- if there isn't an imprint, it's not legit). And at around $18/pound, that's a shady thing to do. They also sell Garofalo pasta for $5/pound, which you can buy at Costco for $12 -- and for that price you get 8 pounds. Also: skip the cannoli. They taste like they just added a little vanilla to a can of Betty Crocker frosting for the filling.\n\nBut they do have several good olive oils that aren't absurdly marked up, as well as my favorite, La Valle San Marzano canned tomatoes which are only a buck or two more than you can find elsewhere. They also sell Maestri Pastai (a very good pasta), but at AJ's prices (although to be fair, Romanelli's and AJ's are the only two stores in the city who sell the brand).\n\nSo, go in for a sandwich, but I can't recommend much else other than the aforementioned few items.

<review>After reading these reviews, I was highly anticipating my visit to the Tuck Shop.  Since I live in the same neighborhood, it already had my seal of approval before I sat down.  Unfortunately, as the evening progressed, the meal continually regressed.  The portions were small and overpriced. The food was poor.  In general, I was disappointed.\n\nThe patatas bravas were glorified french fries - I was extremely disappointed with these.  Yes, the mac and cheese was delicious.  I would gladly order this again.  However, as mentioned by other reviewers, the bowl of mac and cheese is small and definitely not large enough to feed two.  Finally, the halibut tasted pretty good but slightly over-cooked.  \n\nPerhaps I just ordered the wrong items, but I am in no hurry to return.
</review>
<review>I have to say I'm surprised at how many people love this place.  I had the Delux burger, and it was as two stars says...Meh.  I would not go running back there for another one, especially at $10.50 a pop.  I will say the mixed basket of regular and sweet potato fries was tasty ($6.00 but enough to share).  The burger lacked flavor, even with all the toppings including caramelized onions.  Nothing popped when you would bite into it, and even the bun was a little soggy.  I would go to In and Out and get a tasty burger for a better price before going back.  OR, stop in at Blu Burger for a tastier burger at the same price.

<review>I needed 2 new front tires, dropped the car off and came back 1.5 hour later and it was done. Then the problems started. The new tires were put on the back and the old rear tires put on the front. The rear tires were both the same brand but different tread (the tire was discontinued and I had to replace the other). Anybody with a brain knows you do NOT put 2 different treads on the front of a car because the car wil not drive straight. So drove away with 2 kids in the car and the car pulling so hard to the left, that if I let go of the steering wheel for a split second I would crash into the car next to me. \n\nWhen I called and asked that they put the new tires on the front like I had requested they told me it could not be done because the manufacturer requires any new tires be put on the rear, even though my car is front wheel drive AND your supposed to rotate the tires front to back every 6000 miles. When i called Falken tires they told me it is only recommended to put new tires in the back but not required.\n\nThe discount tire solution: Try and sell me 2 new tires! I was told they could adjust things down to $98 for 2 new matching tires. I was blown away by their refusal to simply mount the tires where I requested THEN try and sell me more tires. They ended up comping me the tires and just charging install. \n\nThey also misplaced one of my rim center caps. When I went inside to ask where it was, the schumck at the front who did not work on my car just tells me its wasn`t on there when I came it, but he also did not ask the guy who changed my tires. The rim is discontinued and I can not buy more. Maybe the clipped it to sell, maybe it really just spun off on the way to their shop, but I don`t think so.

<review>So I've admitted in the Biltmore location's review that I secretly LOVE Cheesecake Factory, but this particular location stinks.  \n\nLunch is always busy, and service (up to now) was so-so.  But most recently my co-workers took me to lunch here for my birthday, and here is how the exchange with our 22 year old skanky server went. I swear I am not making this up.  We place our orders and then my co-workers call over our server.  Let's call the 22 year old skanky server Tammy McSleazerston.\n\nCo-workers:  (point over at me like I'm not there, as if to request some kind of retarded ice cream, song and dance freebie) It's his birthday today, could we have some kind of something for him.\nTM:  (In baby voice, and taking her index finger and pointing at her right cheek) Aww, is it your boothday tuhday Mishtuh Man??\nMe:  (Stunned, and not knowing what to say)  Um yeah.\nTM says she'll be back, and walks away.\nMe and Co workers:  (Look at each other jaw-dropped)\n\nWe finish lunch, they give me my stupid ice cream, and we leave a crappy tip and a note to the manager to rein in his flippant servers -- and no apology, or other response.

<review>I too had the lunch special and thought for the price it was a good deal. My pita bread was ice cold and stale, which sort of put a damper on the whole meal. I was expecting more. I liked the variety of meat selections served with the lunch special, but the steak was grizzly. Also, the rice was just okay - it was a tad dry. Also, the decor and ambiance was nothing special and sort of depressing. I'll probably go back and try them again, but I'm not racing back.

The naan was just ok, the Tandoori chicken, meh (well I have never been a big fan of this anyway because almost anywhere it is usually just dry bland chicken to me). The butter chicken type dish with tomatoes, was ok but looked like they added red food coloring. I enjoyed the flavor of the meatball dish, the palak dish was bland. Honestly the only other dish I found interesting other than the meatballs was the Carrot \pudding\"""" which was sauteed sweet minced carrots, went back twice just for that. The sweet rice was ok, it had raisins and coconut.  I generally prefer it without either.\n I may go try it one more time and order off the menu for dinner.

<review>"""HORRIBLE---no, NON-EXISTENT customer service!  Which is a shame considering they have good pizza.  I ordered 2 pizzas, wings, a 2 liter and extra ranch; an hour later, the delivery guy showed up with 1 pizza and wings.  When I told him that the order was not complete, he just rolled his eyes and rudely informed me their online ordering was \messed up\"""".  Then shoved the pizza and wings at me without apologizing or offering to correct the mistake.  Problem was, I had already been charged for the whole order so I was not about to take less than half of what I paid for.  I told him to cancel the order and he turned and stomped away without another word.  I immediately called the store to make sure I would be credited for my screwed up order that the delivery guy made no attempt to correct.  I asked for the manager when they answered.  The girl who answered said to someone in the background (without putting me on hold so I heard every word): \""""Someone wants a manager.  I guess that is you.\""""  The  \""""manager\"""" told her he didn't have time to talk to customers and proceeded to yell at her about all the work he had to do....uh- FYI buddy, customers are THE REASON YOU ARE IN BUSINESS so it would be a good idea to make time for them!!!! The poor girl came back to the phone after being totally berated by the manager, and I told her what had happened with my order. She offered to credit my card for the order.  Only problem is, it takes 48 hours to process.  So now I am out $40 for the next few days, I have waited over an hour and still have no dinner, and I was treated horribly by not one (delivery driver) but two (manager) Mama Mia employees.  I told the girl on the phone that the delivery guy and manager should not treat customers so rudely, she apologetically agreed.  I asked for the contact information of the owner; if this were my business, I would want someone to let me know if my employees were treating customers like dirt.  She could not provide the contact information but offered to call someone named Frank and have him call me back to resolve the situation.  I never received a call.  Apparently, the \""""customers are not important\"""" tone is set at the top in this business.  There are lots of good pizza places in Phoenix, save yourself the hassle and the headache, order from somewhere that actually knows the meaning of customer service."""""""

<review>Whoever runs this stadium has no understanding of baseball tradition or how to serve people food.  \n\nThe concession stands were unbelievably slow. It took 2 and a half innings during a slow moving game to get a hamburger and coke.  What makes it unforgivable is that all the concessions are broken up by food.  So all that this concession offered was hamburgers.  There was no guessing what the next customer would order and the lines were huge.  Hmm, I wonder what the people are waiting in line for?? \n\nIn the 7th inning, the stadium committed the ultimate sin for a ballpark.  They replaced 'Take me out to the Ballgame' for seventh inning stretch with 'Cotton Eyed Joe'.  Are you freaking kidding me??? \n\nWhat a poorly run ballpark... Needless to say, 1 star.

<review>Just once, I would like to be charged at the end what is quoted in the beginning.  \n\nMy alternator went out and I called American Auto Lube and Repair as they have positive reviews on another review site.  They quoted me $221 for the alternator.  The same alternator sells retail at O'Reilly for $180 but I figured they have to make their money and I am sure they do not have the buying power of O'Reilly.  \n\nSurprise, Surprise, I get the bill at the end and they charged me $272 for the alternator.

<review>My last visit there ended in a total mess. I ordered pick up, the item i had problem with was the bean curd family style with vegetables, as the waiter seem to think it did not exist. So I had to point to him where that was on the menu. Once I did he said that must be a new item, it wasn't as I have ordered that every time I visited in the last 2 years.  His excuse was it was new to him as he had not seen the time in two years. After telling him the other items I had to re-point him to where the tofu dish was. I told him he should write the number down for that item, he explain the cook did not go off of that.\n\nWhen it was done they handed me a 4 item meal in one bag. Keep in mind I live about 20 - 25 minutes away. When I got home I found instead of tofu dish, I had a shrimp dish. I called them, and the waiter asked if i was sure it was wrong.  Just a hint tofu is square, shrimp is not. After making it clear the dish was wrong he told me he would have to find the cook to see if she would replace it. I decided I just wanted my money back on that item. That was until I went through the bag further.  The egg rolls were on the bottom of the bag soaking in fluids from the other meals. Unlike most Chinese take out these guys do not put it in boxes and bag it separately if it will leak,instead they put it in styrofoam. That was the last straw I decided I wanted a full refund.\n\nWhen I got there I had a replacement to my order, despite the fact I stated I wanted a refund on the phone. I also stated I wanted all of my money back as I showed them pictures from my iPad of what my meal looked like. First excuse was the guy was new, seriously three months should be enough time to know your job when handling orders. The worst part was it was my fault that fluids from my food leaked on everything according to the manager. I got my refund, but the manger does not understand what went wrong. Clearly I will not be going back again.

<review>They only have a few good instructors left at this gym, since most have left for better paying gyms. It has gone down the tubes in my opinion. The whole place needs a facelift and the management could care less.

But when I went to use it, the keg put out foam all night! I did everything I was supposed to do from keeping it cold to tapping it correctly. We ended up going to Fry's and just buying beer for the party! When I returned the keg  and  explained the issues nobody cared. I spent over $180 on this keg.

<review>Pros: Free wifi.\n\nCons: \n-really narrow security line\n-not many power outlets by the gates and some didn't work\n-no gate agents to be found on a Saturday after Christmas--especially troubling when my flight got cancelled, luckily I got through to the airline on the phone\n-the most confusing path to car rental return I have ever seen in my life, and judging by other cars on the road, they were puzzled too\n-the concessions/stores in Terminal 3 closed early (5 and 5:30).  Faced with the prospect of being stranded there all night, I had to buy food early or I would have been stuck with nothing.  Also, pickings were extremely slim for food shops.

<review>"""eh, I don't know how to even start this. I guess I'll start on the positives the staff was very nice and I used the restaurant.com coupon so I got about $40 dollars worth of sushi for like $22 after tip. Also, the interior was really cool looking and the little sake bottles along the wall that had been signed and stuff was a nice touch. Now the problem is that this was probably the most bland sushi I have ever eaten. It's not that anything was out right disgusting (maybe it was due to blandness idk, but it wasn't full of any weird nasty flavors) but I didn't finish much of the food at all.\n\nI had a good mix of different rolls.. firecracker (i think) which sounded good with spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, along with a spicy tuna, a vegas, and the sushi sampler with various nigiri. The prices were cheap so I wasn't expecting anything amazing but lets just say if I had paid full price I would have been severely disappointed and this might have gotten one star. Everything was just bland and the definition of \Meh\"""", the nigiri had super thin slices fish on it which isn't a terrible thing but it was on a HUGE ball of rice so I was basically eating riceballs. The spicy tuna which is hard to mess up was just not good at all. The rest was just more of the same. \n\nOverall, this place is getting a gift with two stars. I really like sushi and I have no problem eating it at cheaper places (think Ra happy hour or even Teharu Sushi) but this is honestly a place I won't be coming back to no matter how cheap it is."""""""

<review>The gym is nice and clean, everything looks new but its not worth the price.  I've been a member at several golds gyms and this is by far the smallest and most limited I've been to yet; and the most expensive, i am already canceling my membership.\n\nThere is a serious lack of space or options when it comes to free weights.  Most of the plates end up stacked on the sides of machines, so you need to work around others to get the weights off.  Why not just a simple plate tree?  There is good area for doing squats or deadlifts.  Few if any leg machines.\n\nMost of the floor is filled with all sorts of cardio and nautilus styles machines.  The trainers like to occupy benchs when their trainee is on a different machine.  Bottomline: if you are looking for a place to be seen, go here.  If you want to workout, find some where else.

<review>Very disappointed.  The lamb with gnocci was 90% gnocci, very few bites of lamb and the gnocci was doughy and flavorless.  The chicken saltimbocca arrived overcooked, one dry, stuck-together lump of heavily-spiced chicken bites with very few mushrooms or onions or anything else. \nAll four tables surrounding ours arrived well after we did and yet received their food well before we did, even after we politely inquired about our order.  \nThe only positive was our waitperson - very pleasant and funny, and we actually felt bad for her!\nNo plans to return, obviously.  Too bad, could be different as  it has nice atmosphere, easy and plentiful parking.

<review>"""= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =\n\nIt's been almost a year since I was here,  and  last time one of the things that I didn't care for was that I was seated near a glary window.  Thus, I dropped back in here today with Mike C. to give it another try  and  see if I could get it up to 4-Stars.\n\nWell, we sat well back inside the restaurant, so there wasn't a glare, but now that i've visited many (all?) of the Indian buffets around the Valley, I found the selection here to be a little small, the Tandoori Chicken tasted like benzene (!),  and  the service wasn't friendly.  It IS a stylish place, inside  and  out,  and  it wasn't \bad\"""", really, but I'm not likely to return to this one.  We just have better choices in Indian Buffet.  \n\nLunch Buffet $8.99"""""""

<review>Luckily we had a Groupon otherwise I would have been even more disappointed.\n\nIf you say the chicken you're putting on the pizza is grilled then grill it for gosh sakes. Don't give me some freezer burned, dirty tasting shredded chicken with dab of pesto sauce on it. Yuck.\n\nMy partner had the spaghetti and meatballs which was okay, but came with one lonely slice of bread. Can't they splurge and be a little more generous with the bread? Especially for almost $40 bucks. \n\nFor $36 plus tip you get a pizza, Spaghetti and Meatballs, an Iced Tea and one glass of wine. The Safeway store brand frozen pizza is better than this.\n\nWhy I came here twice is beyond me. Never, ever again.

<review>"""Ah, another day, another new buffet!   :-))\n\nSo Here's \Golden Nugget Chinese Buffet\"""".  It's beyond scary from the front, so I put off eating here for nearly a year, but today was the day to fight off several temptations  and  finally give it a try.  It's a small place, seating 36 inside plus some shaded patio tables out front.\n\nTemptation #1 was that I had to drive past Best Wok Buffet at 51st Av.  and  McDowell to get to this place.  Now Best Wok (* * *) is no Zen/Jen, but it's practically free at $4.25  and  you just can't go wrong for the price.  (I eat there all the time.)\n\nTemptations #2  and  3 are that there is the big \""""New China Buffet\"""", nearly 4-Stars, right across the street,  and  also 4-Star Sizzler (Buffet), right over there, too.

<review>BS West is only getting two stars because of the easy parking and the layout of the place.  It can support alot of people without feeling like you are getting bumped and pushed.  The bar runs across the place so you never have to go far to get to the bartender.  Too bad you will end up waiting a long time because of the unattentive bartenders.  I have been there with a friend waiting 15 minutes at the front of the bar while the bartender had a conversation with a friend.  Another big problem with this place is the customers.  No one here conversates with others outside their group (I tried).  The customers are almost as rude as the bartenders.  The drinks are very expensive for the quality of alcohol you will be getting.  I realize it is in Scottsdale which is supposed to be nice and normally I don't mind spending more for better atmosphere and service but you will not find it at BS West.  It is a complete rip-off!

<review>"""J and I were planning on attending this event.  Mainly because I had purchased a Groupon that got us 2 for the price of 1.  That and we have watched both seasons of F.T.R and love it!  Needless to say, we were pretty excited for this event. \n\nWe got to Indian Bend and the 101 around 10:00am.  Having never been to the ballpark before, I wasn't sure if I was heading in the right direction.  No sooner than I got to Pima, I start seeing the line of cars.   \n\nIt takes 30 minutes to finally get to a lot entrance.  I ask the guy standing at the entrance if there's expectant mother parking.  He says no, but that I'm free to park in the area where they're directing those with handicapped plates and placecards.  I thank him and drive over to the grassy knoll.  I don't even have a chance to put my truck into park before some guy comes running over telling me I cant park there.  I very strongly said, \Well I'm pregnant, and the gentleman right over there said that I could.\""""  He doesn't say another word.  The woman in the car next to me then said, \""""They'll end up giving you a ticket.\""""  I state that since this isn't technically handicapped parking - No signs that state HC only parking - They technically don't have the right.  I then remembered where I was and I didn't really feel like fooling around with tribal cops.   I throw the truck into reverse and get in the line to head to park with the rest of the cars.  \n\nWe finally get to the head of the parking line and next thing we know, we're being told parking is $5.  NO WHERE ON OUR WAY INTO THE LOT WE WERE PARKING IN DID IT STATE PARKING WAS $5!!!  We were livid.  No where on the event website did it state that parking was $5.  We pretty much yell this to the min. wage lot attendants.  AND - Where does SRPM get off charging people $5 to park in a f-ing DIRT LOT!?   $7 for parking for events at the State Fair location in Phoenix (which they have noted on their website)- to park on a paved lot.....Fine.  $5 to park on a f-ing dirt lot?  I told them where they could shove the car behind me's $5 and make a U-Turn to leave.  \n\nJ and I ended up going to breakfast instead - where we didn't have to pay to park.  \n\nFrom what I'm told, and from what I'm gathering with glancing at a few reviews - the Street Eats Festival was not worth it.  With long lines, and trucks running out of food.  I'm now kind of glad we bailed in the dirt lot."""""""

<review>I have to agree with the others, it's not much but a high priced ice cream stop. The concept was good when it first arrived on the blockmany years ago, but now I wonder why people keep returning. This was my 1st or maybe my 2nd visit to the Creamery, I think I went decades ago to the first one on Mill Ave. \n\nHowever for the $6 I spent on a medium scoop with mix-ins I am not impressed. The coupons given to me I will pass along to some friends' kids who may or may not ever use them.

<review>I have yet to visit this facility or see it's doctors, but now I never will.  I had made an appointment about a month ahead for a regular check up, and I have just received a call that they had to reschedule my appointment. Now I am not a totally unreasonable person, I understand even Dr's have lives and things happen, but my appoint wasn't for three weeks, anything worth canceling on (i.e. a death or being sick) would be over with by then. When I questioned why I had to reschedule my appointment I was told the Dr wasn't going to be able to make it in that day. My appointment was on a Friday... sounds like some one decided to go on vacation to me. I do not have time to deal with an office where appointments are meaningless.

<review>I've been itching to go to FEZ for a long time based on all the other wonderful reviews. I drive by FEZ nearly every day as I work just down the street.  \n\nFinally went with a buddy of mine and I got razzed more than I'd like for picking out a sub-par place! That is factoring in the food and the service. I'd probably give 2.5, 3 stars for the food. I'd give 1.5 stars for the service.  Went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, although the service would have suggested otherwise. Now don't get me wrong, the waitress was very pleasant and personable, but the time that went by before we got refills or that my dining companion's DIET COKE was fixed to a regular coke took too long. Me not being a soda drink couldn't care less about diet vs. regular but I know, I know, you soda drinkers need to have it exactly as you're taste buds know. \n\nThe food: I already had a lunch so just got the kisra and hummus.  I must  say I was extremely impressed with the taste of the kisra....actually...I would come here for the kisra and hummus for lunch, for sure. But I would get it to go. I wouldn't come back on a lazy Sunday afternoon b/c although I'm being lazy, I don't want the service lazy.  On to my friend's lunch...he got the All-American Burger. To me, this should have come on a sesame seed bun, what's more American other than apple pie,right?  Now I understand the Mediterranean flair that is FEZ, but it just didn't seem right to call it All-American when it's more like half-American....and his salt and pepper fries were not even warm-ish. And they tasted reheated. boo.\n\nWe both decided this would maybe have been a better time had if we were there in the evening. I think we'll give it one more try at night and see if we don't enjoy it a little more.\n\nMaybe my hopes were built up b/c of all the other great reviews, maybe we came at a bad time, maybe he ordered the wrong item. Maybe I'll give FEZ another shot....but I'm not in a hurry to do that right now.

<review>i switched to the human bean in red bluff so that i didnt have to feed corporate america via starbucks. the coffee is comparable, but the price is the same...which it shouldnt be since it doesnt have the overhead. when i was forced to pay a quarter to get my 2 year old a cup of water after paying 4 bucks for coffee, i refused and gave the water back. she said i could wait in the parking lot whil.e she contacted the owner re. a refund. it was 109 degrees ...f that. i left without the quarter that she charged  me, without the water...and ill never go back. starbucks is successful for a reason, i know that now

<review>After the excruciating four hour long Barrett Honors College convocation ceremony my parents took me (new graduate) and my boyfriend out for celebratory BBQ. My dad talked Lucille's up like it was better than Pappy's in St. Louis. He raved about the biscuits, the ribs, and the apple butter for days before we attended my ceremony, and I was really excited to try the food. Disappointment does not even begin to describe our experience.\n\nThe restaurant was relatively empty at the time of our visit. The hostess sat us at a table that could, possibly, have doubled as the freezer. The AC was turned way to low on a relatively cool evening, and I was shivering throughout my entire meal. I know that this isn't the hostess' or the waitress' fault, but my mom asked several times if they could turn up the AC or move us. \n\nThe food was terrible. I ordered a full rack of ribs for $26.99 and they were burnt to high hell. Paired with the AC, my whole plate was cold in five minutes flat. I ordered Mac and Cheese as both of my sides and that was decent. My parents also split a burnt full rack of ribs, and my boyfriend had an average tasting pulled pork sandwich. We were served terrible quality food for the pricing of this restaurant. \n\nOur waitress was really nice, but I think she should have noticed how burnt the food was that she served us. I understand that we visited the restaurant at 9:20pm on a Wednesday evening, but their website showed that they take reservations all the way until 9:30pm. It is just really unfortunate that this establishment doesn't take more pride in their product. People go to restaurants on memory making occasions, and a bad dinner can ruin a good moment. Lucille's would do better to remember that in the future. \n\nTL;DR Burnt food, terrible for the price, will ruin your graduation experience.
</review>
<review>The ambiance was promising when we all arrived.  It was suggested that the prime rib would be the best option so I ordered the 7 oz, medium (using their menu-rankings and descriptions as a guide), plus the usual sides.\n\nWhat I got was essentially steak tartar, with a millimeter-thick quick sear on the outside.  On first bite I wasn't sure what I was eating, so I had a second.  Then it became apparent that the middle of the steak was not only rare, it was completely raw .. basically refrigerator-cold to the tongue.\n\nSo, steak sashimi not being what I wanted I waited for the server to return.  This didn't happen so I got up and went searching through the restaurant, to no avail.  I finally just stood in the middle of a busy intersection until one passed by, and explained the situation.  He could not find our server either so agreed to take it back for 'reheating'.\n\nA few minutes later someone higher up came and apologized and said another would would be right up.  The rest of our party continued to dine while I sat there with no dining whatsoever, no refills on water/drink etc.  About 20 minutes later my food arrived (45 mins after ordering), and everyone else was most way through theirs.  \n\nWith wine glass completely empty, no service for refills forthcoming, I proceeded into steak #2 with just a glass of water.\n\nSteak #2 was marginally better, but in lieu of medium it was just well done on the outer ring and again, all-rare tartar in the middle.\n\nI gave up after a few bites, just surrendered the meal altogether and just went to a taco take-out on the way back to the hotel.\n\nI didn't do an exhaustive review of the check but it did not look like anything was comped, though the restaurant put in a $25 gift card for a future visit.  This I regarded as a final insult, as I have no desire to return to this place and in lieu of making up for the bad meal and poor service, the only apparent apology is an invitation to come back and do it all over again.\n\nI hope others have a better experience.

<review>Hmph... I had always wanted to try this spot, and living within walking distance for the past 3 years hasn't done much to change that, until now.  After catching a show at the Herberger, Ashley A. suggested we go here for drinks/food.  I wasn't really feeling it because I was scared of what I expected in terms of premium pricing, but we went anyway.  The elevator ride up was fun and it made my ears pop.  Once we got off the elevator though, things kind of stopped being fun and I felt like I just stepped into a closet.  It was so dark!\n\nI will give the Compass one thing, their service is fantastic.  Unfortunately, service does not make up for the lack of quality in food or the overwhelmingly inflated prices.  They didn't have Coke, which really irritated me, so I just had a water.  We ended up getting the Drunken Shrimp app since we weren't entirely hungry and then the Lava Cake for dessert.  The sauce with the shrimp was startlingly salty.  Even for me, and I oversalt everything.  The shrimp were okay, and there were only three.  Seriously?  20 bucks for 3 shrimp and a piece of bread.  Sheesh!  At least the desserts were priced fairly.  The lava cake was okay, but it doesn't even come close to my beloved Domino's Lava Crunch Cake.  \n\nAfter checking out the rather uninspired menu and it's awe inspiring prices, I won't be back.  Besides, the view from the top of the Chase Tower is much more impressive, so the view alone will not get me to come back.
</review>
<review>Update:  I realized I had overrated it before. I think i am still being generous with two stars. \n\nBasic chain Americanized style of Mexican food. It's alright, but nothing special. Noting that our GPS had it listed under American food and not Mexican should have been the first clue. Totally forgettable and certainly won't be on my list, or on the list of anyone I know, when I come back to Phoenix. \n\nThere are so many choices around, don't waste your time and money on something so very mediocre.
</review>
<review>"""$25 for a pizza. and it's really not all that great. \n\nThe owner chimed in, so after further thought, I upgraded Streets of NY because their food is good, just not my fav, and in MY OPINION, over priced.\n\nI did keep noticing some pretty bland sauces in the calzones, so I quit ordering them.. and then I noticed the same thing on the pizza. Kinda waters it down, for lack of a better term. If you take issue with some sauces, the only pizza I would recommend is their Pesto, which I have had, and it is delicious. \n\nIt looks like on paper they have a good lunch menu, which I have not tried. I'm more apt to get a sub for lunch than do a sit down, which the average bill goes from $8 to $15-$20 with tip. and last time I ate there, which was last week for dinner with a buddy, I was annoyed that while I was eating the server asked me if I wanted a beer after I already ordered coke. This was after I had already been served and was drinking it. I just felt like it was kinda tacky, maybe even pushy. You see, I had a DUI last year and i'm more sensitive to drinking and driving these days. I drove that night and did not want to drink alcohol, hence ordering the coke. So, why would a server be asking me if \i want a beer or something??\"""" To boost the bill maybe? Yeah, I think so for sure. \n\nAs far as the pizza, I'm not here to advertise another restaurant, I just know that there are better deals on pizza. For that kind of money, I'd rather just get something from the grocery store and cook it at home OR get a Happy Hour Deal at a restaurant in Scottsdale."""""""

<review>If we were able to give 0 stars... I would ask to give -1.\n\nI live nearby, and am sad to see that a coffeeshop that sells coffee this horrible is still in business in my neighborhood.\n\nNot only was the breve mocha that I ordered disgusting, so was the process of watching the barista make my drink.\n\nThey use hershey's chocolate from a dirty nacho cheese style pump with chocolate sauce dripping down the sides, and coagulated into a thick cap at the tip of the nozzle.  *Disgusting.  \n\nThe espresso shot was made without care, or concern for the fact that it was done way too quickly, and with espresso grounds that were ground way before I walked in the door.  Possibly way before the barista started her shift.   *Gross\n\nAnd finally.  The milk.  She steamed the milk with the automatic steam wand.  This was a huge red flag.  Those are notorious for burning milk and making disgusting drinks.  Well, both were accomplished. \n\nThe steam wand was tinted white from lack of cleaning.  And the worst part was that near the end of the wand was a DARK CHEESE that had accumulated from burning milk and not cleaning the wand after every use. \nWhich is FREAKIN - DISGUSTING.\n\nI wasted 5 bucks on an overpriced small mocha, and threw it away after taking a sip.  \n\nHundreds of businesses in the area close down every year, and there are more realty signs in strip malls in this neighborhood than actual storefronts.  AND I really don't understand why this place hasn't joined the many defunct businesses and starry eyed entrepreneurs in the unemployment line.  \n\nIf you own a coffeeshop.  Coffee should be your passion.  \nIf you own a bait shop.  Fishing should be your passion.\nIf you just want to open up a business that mirrors a nearby popular chain (short, tall, grande), please stop wasting space in the strip mall and get a day job in a cubicle.\n\nNever going back, warning my friends about this place, and am probably going to contact the health department on Monday.

<review>"""I've lived down the street from this carwash for years. Since I wanted to removed a think layer of dirt and dust from a car quickly I went here for the quick automated wash. The price was good and all, but the problem happened when I got back home and noticed that the roughness of the automated wash had torn off one of my side mirror panels. I went back there to ask them if they had found it and they let me look around a bit. It had only been no more than 15 minutes since I had left there and it was no where to be found. One of the employees there tried to tell me that it could have slipped under the drain, which is impossible because this panel is over 6\x 8\"""" and would not have slipped through the grate. All I got in response to this was a simple \""""sorry\"""" and no offer of anything to make it up. I had to buy a $100 replace for both mirrors as they are not sold individually. Personally, since I looked everywhere for it myself, I'm thinking the piece may have been run over by another customer's car after mine and they just threw away the evidence."""""""

<review>I had been wanting to have barbeque for awhile. This was the only place that was close to me. I had read the bad to average reviews, but still decided to give it a shot.  That was a mistake. There was no other customers inside and the food was incredibly bland. \n\nI decided to go with the 2 meat dinner combo. It ran just under $15. I went with pork ribs and sausage. For my sides I had Mac  and  Cheese and baked beans. The thing that had the most taste was was the baked beans and they tasted like they came straight from a can.  \n\nI would not recommend going here to anyone. I personally will not be going back.
</review>
<review>What kills this place is certainly not the food...its the service!!\nWaited 10 minutes to even be approached by my waitress. I actually had to get up and ask the host for our drink order, which he didn't get because he was texting on his cell phone. The table to our left arrived after us and got their food, drinks and check before we even got our food. \nBreakfast was great, it always is...but the service is horribly slow and made me ask myself several times if I was on some sort of prank show because I just can't believe this is acceptable/normal. \nThe manager was even walking around asking customers how everything was going, but convenietly forgot to ask our table. \n\nMaybe next time I'll order it to go?

<review>02.08.10\n\nI don't know why I almost always end my trip reviews with a bad one on a fast food restaurant at the airport.  This is no different.\n\nSeriously, I know life sucks when you work at a fast food restaurant at the airport.  If you don't want to work there, maybe you should find another job.  It's definitely not good for business when you have a sour look on your face while you point me to another cashier because you don't feel like taking my order.\n\nI did get an extra piece of nugget.  In your face.
</review>
<review>If you like an arrogant waitress you are in luck! If you do not have a reservation be prepared to sit in the sun (where today, 12/29, you smell gas from the construction next door) or in the yellow room (if there is anyone beside your table, you can't hear each other). The food was fairly good, but if you are not really hungrey and just want a small soup or salad, no choices. For the money, not worth it. Especially have a waitress that completely made me feel like a second class citizen.
</review>
<review>If I could give negative stars I would. This place sucks. We have eaten here a few times and the service has always been subpar, but this trip takes the cake. We left after 15 minutes standing in line while the only two employees on the floor were making passes at the Pepsi vendor working on the soda fountain. We will not be back to this location, I would rather make the trip to Gilbert were their food is actually fresh and the service isn't terrible.
</review>
<review>Man, this place sucks. The service was awful. The server forgot my husband's drink. The food took a long time to come out. We ordered cheese sticks for $7.49, it came with only 5 cheese sticks. They charged us .50 cents for ranch even though it says on the menu that the cheese sticks come with ranch. Our server disappeared halfway through our dinner. Just as bad experience all together. Its a convenient place because its connected to the Best Western, but its overpriced. Avoid Hoot  and  Howl.

<review>"""I used to come here on occasion and always had a blast; HOWEVER, this time around has put me off forever.  Went to eat with friends; waitress I found to be rude as she acknowledge my guy friends and barely made contact with me throughout the night.  Sat in my chair, did not look at me nor apologize when I came back, to find her sitting there beside my significant other.  Odd...\n\nSince I found her demeanor to be lacking and found her to be rude, and short, I tipped her 10%; which she in turn told me that was \shitty\"""" and proceeded then to call me a \""""bitch\"""" several times.\n\nI kept my composure while she continued to have issues with her anger and I asked to speak to the manager.  I knew from her tone that the manager would not be helpful at all, and I was correct.  He was insincere and unhelpful.

<review>Not a fan.\nSadly this is where my doctor and Insurance have me go for appointments.\nI have asked them to send me to the location at Arrowhead and it is better.\n\nThe wait is horrendous, when you have a high insurance deductible I would HIGHLY recommend someone calls to talk to you before your appoint to talk to you about the price of your procedure. Ken S is right on the money with this.\n\nLook I know how a medical office SHOULD work, I've worked in one before. You call usually a few days before to verify insurance and you get all of the information about deductibles etc. \n\nDo the patient a favor and call them. \n\nService here is pretty bad. I will go to the arrowhead location if I have to go here again.

<review>Well, This review is based on the sushi alone --- so 1 star. If I was reviewing the bar - 5 stars!\n\nAnyway --- If you actually enjoy RA Sushi, I wonder if you're only eating Vegas Rolls and potsickers. I know your type: New to sushi, want to get drunk with your friends and pretend to actually enjoy raw fish. I know, I know...you're in college and it's Mill Ave. \n\nI am fine to get trashed here, I LOVE their bartenders and inventive drinks...but the food is nast. \n\nThat's RA in a nutshell.

<review>Really everyone? This pho place is by far ranked down there on the Pho places I've had. Growing up in San Jose, one of the largest Vietnamese comminutes in the country, I'll say I've been to a fair amount of Pho places. I drove to Orange County, CA all the time in college just to get Pho. I'd like to think I have some Pho cred. But hey I know this is AZ- the pho competition  is not like in CA where there's larger Vietnamese communities/restaurants. This place really skimps out on noodles and meat. Seriously for the regular bowl of pho it felt like the amount of noodles and meat you get for kiddie size. You know that feeling when you eat all the noodles and meat and you're FULL but there's still all the soup there? Yea not here! I also tried their pork and rice and it that was the nail in the coffin. The pork meat tasted like rubber and it was amazingly VERY dry. Also try not to burn the sauce on the pork- doesnt taste yummy. I hope I......wait for it......phoget about this place! Service was good though +1.
</review>
<review>Take warning! Do NOT go here for sporting events, especially football! I gave 1 star bc the wait staff was ok. They did not make the home town team thr priority game. I was tucked in a corner for Cardinals game watching a tv with no HD. I ended up leaving after the first quarter... Better off at home... Or ANY other sports bar in town! In all fairness, I cannot speak to the quality of food or atmosphere when it isn't a game day.
</review>
<review>Had some apps  and  drinks here a couple nights ago. They have a really nice patio  and  it's a pretty nice location.\n\nI'm all about food though.  We had mini chimis, beef taquitos  and  spinach artichoke dip - nothing sexy. Seemed like the mini chimis  and  taquitos likely came frozen in a huge bag - have enjoyed ones we've gotten in the frozen section of the supermarket more. The spinach artichoke dip was kind of bizarre too. Tasted predominately of cream/sour cream without much flavor. \n\nWould go back for a social thing but if we ordered food here, definitely would try something different.
</review>
<review>I had lunch at the Scottsdale location this week.  I was carrying a Contigo water bottle.  The hostess who seated me asked what was in the water bottle.  DUH - water!  Odd- never had that happen before.   I was seated right away but it took 10-15 minutes for the person to take the order.  Food came out very quickly.  Chicken breast was lukewarm, tough and not very tasty.  KFC has better chicken for less money.  Waffle was ok but the maple syrup had no maple flavor.  Paid with a credit card and had to show a driver's license.  Odd again -- can't recall that happening in a long time.   There are many places to eat where the food is better and your water bottle is not treated with suspicion.  Skip this place
</review>
<review>Not a bad place for being in a strip mall, buy don't expect service. It seemed as though we were more of an annoyance then a guest.  Basic service, but when you have to find you waitress to get what you already asked for and then she has another person bring you the check as she stands up front, kind of makes you feel unwelcomed. Wings were great , not so much the boneless. All in all, great place to order to go bone- in wings

<review>Okay, I want to like it more than I do but.....well, lets just dig into the review. First, know that I went there for lunch on a Saturday, not in the evening when it is in full swing, so maybe I missed part of the ambiance but honestly, I went there to try the food. \n\nFirst, I had the olives appetizer and based just on that, this place would be amazing. It was a small plate full of big, meaty, green olives, obviously warmed in a bath of live oil and served with a light sprinkle of salt and oh, so good. I would go back just for these. But, an appetizer does not a meal make so lets go on to the main course and side dish. \n\nFor lunch I had some sort of pasta which was advertised to have anchovies, lemon, and if i remember correctly, hot pepper. I also ordered a side of braised greens. The pasta, when it was served, came in a large white bowl and honestly, when I order a pasta dish over $10, I prefer it to be well...plated, on a plate. The dish also contained sauteed fennel which, while not unpleasant, was not expected, and it seemed, it was a bit dry. As for the braised greens, also served in a large white bowl and that was it, just the braised greens. Some cracked black pepper and some shaving of hard cheese, would definitely have helped round out the side dish (though at $3 I can't complain too much but make it $4 and bump it up a bit). \n\nFinally, the decor, nothing really stands out. Sen, right next door, has much more of an artistic edge so maybe they could kick up the look of the place a bit. So, take the review for what it is and if nothing else, go in the evening for a glass of wine and the olive appetizer (a steal at $5) but overall, it did not wow me as much as I expected from all the write-ups.

<review>"""Formerly a restaurant I raved about (circa 2009 :), Tee Pee's has very much gone downhill. It started with the salsa; the one thing I looked forward to the most, as chips and salsa are one of the staples of my diet. Once fresh-tasting, smoldering, and served in copious amounts, the salsa served was a sweet and ketchup-y stale (a la Pace Picante) and presented in what appeared to be a shallow ashtray. It was however, attentively refilled. But seeing our server so many times before reaching an endorphin-boosting caloric level made the interruptions a bit annoying. \n\nI really want to skip to the best part though, so instead of describing how unpleasant our server was, how our food was served at a nuclear-hot temperature and quickly turned icy in the arctic corner of the bar (as the common area was the polar opposite -- hot, crowded, and littered with crying children,...), how our nachos were covered in quite obviously right-out-of-the-can green chillies, and unacceptably dirty silverware,... was their \hot\"""" salsa (NOT HOT,... AT ALL!!) located on each table in a plastic 'squeeze' ketchup bottle. \n\nI'm not sure who the genius was who decided to put a slightly chunky sauce into a bottle with a small tapered opening, but the result was salsa clogging the end and squirting with such force, every person at the table was sprayed with this smokey ketchup crap. I have a feeling that same person designed the post office parking lot near my home,... but I digress. \n\n:: WARNING TO FUTURE DINERS :: \n\nPartially resulting from an immediate need to seek revenge, and partially because potty humor and booger jokes still crack me up, there is one UNIDENTIFIED bottle of table salsa that has been contaminated with an enormous booger. \n\nI'm  p r o b a b l y  joking,... Who would do that :^) \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be coming back. Los Dos Molinos isn't THAT far away."""""""

<review>We came here with comp'd coupons about a month after a less than stellar experience at The Eggery's sister restaurant The Good Egg on N. Central.  Refusing to go back there at the risk of getting the same waitress, we headed up the road to use the coupons.  It was realtively busy. They sat us next to the emergency exit in a renovated add on, enclosed patio type area, it was cramped and uncomfortable, but remained hopeful.  Our waitress came through took our drink order We got our drinks quickly and were not ready to order just yet.  Mistake!  We then waited, and waited....with no sign of our waitress or any other one for that matter in our area.  We waited...finally about 30 min after being seated a lady who looked more official than a server asked if we had been helped, she must have seen the famished look on our faces and seen we were about ready to walk out.  She then took our order and we recieved it relatively quicky (within like 15 min of taking the order or less).  Thankfully we had no where to be in any specific time.  We left full, the food run of the mill.  Thankful we had coupons in all the experience was barely worth the tip we left.

<review>"""This place is supposedly owned by the same people that own Sapporo. Or maybe it was and isn't now, I don't know. What I do know is that we have been there many times and the one constant is the shiiiiiiiitttttty service. Here's an anecdote: \n\nThree friends and I went to Ten to get some sushi. We ordered sushi. My little deal is I like to order spicy tuna rolls but--get this--add avocado. Because avocado is good. The couple with me orders a spicy salmon roll, which ordinarily comes with avocado--except that they didn't want the avo. So, among other things, we should be receiving spicy tuna rolls *with* avocado and spicy salmon rolls *without* avocado. Backwards, yes. \n\nWell of course I wouldn't be writing this if that's what had arrived. No, alas, we got our rolls but sans modifiers, i.e. spicy salmon with and spicy tuna without avocado. So I politely pointed this out to the waiter. The appropriate response would be: O. M. G. I'm so sorry--be right back with the correct order. Nope. The waiter looks at the rolls and then goes to check with the sushi chef. He returns and tells us (!) that the rolls are actually correct: that salmon colored roll is indeed tuna, and the tuna colored roll is, in fact, salmon. When confronted with the issue of salmon colored ties (not to mention half of Craig Sager's wardrobe) being named after the wrong goddamned fish, the waiter could only muster a vacant stare and offered to talk to the manager. TALK TO THE MANAGER? \n\nSo the manager comes and reiterates: yes, that is indeed tuna. \The one colored like salmon?\"""" Yes. \""""And the tuna colored one?\"""" Salmon. Ah. \""""Would it matter to you if I told you that I ate the 'tuna' roll and it tasted conspicuously salmony?\"""" No, that is indeed tuna. We add to our tuna (insert name of some made up, nonexistent spice that turns tuna salmon color and vice-versa) and that makes it look that way. \n\nNow I'm making this story drag, I admit. But the concept of someone so brazenly lying to me (or just being plain fucking stupid) is highly irritating to me. If it weren't, I'd watch fox news. But no, the manager and waiter all stuck to their story. What I should have done is played along and ordered a spicy \""""salmon\"""" roll, complete with avocado. But I was too pissed to do that, and so instead I argued with the manager and embarrassed my friends. Sorry all. \n\nMoral of the story: Ten has mediocre food and fucking dipshits working the sushi bar. If you trust these mensas with raw fish that you're about to eat, go ahead. Otherwise I recommend Celsius or Shogun. (reviews to come, maybe.)"""""""

<review>"""Y'all are officially on notice.  Why?  It was based on these reviews that I decided to try the place.\n\nI was totally prepared to wait when we arrived because we got there at about 7:15 on a Friday night.  They said 30 min wait for a party of 5. Not too bad.  After watching 3 groups who came in after us be seated first (and yes, one was a party of 5) we approached the hostess stand to check on things.  Suddenly we were \next\"""".\n\nServer was Justin.  He said his hellos, told us about the specials, took our drink orders. We'd planned to try a few appetizers, but at that point we were all hungry enough we wanted to go right for the main course. Then we were brought the chips and salsa.  I inquired about the 3 salsas.  He said, this one is hot, this one is pico de gallo, and this is our pineapple salsa.  The chips weren't just \""""got out of a bag\"""" chips, they were no-name, not very good, wouldn't serve them to my friends chips.  But, we nibbled on them anyhow because we wanted to try the salsas.  I went right for the hot.  Hot?  It was barely warm.  It was very \""""tomato\"""" tasting, with one person commenting that it almost had spagetti sauce taste.  How can you be going for a Latin flavor and not be packing any heat??  I try the \""""Pico de gallo\"""".  It's chunky salsa.  But whatever.  It had that fresh taste that many salsas have fresh out of the bottle.  My last hopes were the pineapple salsa.  It was different, and in the end the one I actually liked the most because at least they were trying to be creative.\n\nCan you believe I'm not to the main courses yet?  Justin sets them down quickly and makes his escape.  Visually - they were quite good.  2 of our folks got tortas - one beef and one chicken.  They were \""""fine\"""".  Both tortas and the burgers come with fries and the fruit slaw on the side. No one liked the slaw.(Friend said it was more straw than slaw)  To me, it was ok - but not worthy of the large portion it took on the plate.  Would have been MUCH better to just fill the plate with the waffle fries that were actually pretty good.  One person got shrimp enchiladas.  That was pretty good - but could have been done just as well or better by quite a few places in town.  I got the pork loin chops.  Honestly - with this being one at their highest price point, I figured I should really get to see their strength here.  It was pretty.  The two thin chops were cooked fine - but it wasn't cooked IN anything for extra flavor, which pork really needs.  It touted an \""""herby garlic, cilantro, lime sauce\"""".  It was green, and not bad, but with those things you would have thought it might have had more kick.  Or at least flavor. It wasn't bad in a way that detracted from the meal, but it didn't add much.  The green beans were at that same \""""fine\"""" point.  They were very green and looked great.  But beyond the almonds someone threw on top (again, not cooked with at all, just threw on top at the last minute) there wasn't much flavor.  ( I buy the big frozen bag from Trader Joe's, steam them, toss w/ a pat of butter, salt and pepper and they could kick the butt of these green beans. I didn't have that high of a bar, but they didn't even meet it.)\n\nThe night was capped with some poor service mistakes.  Several of us had discussed trying a desert.  Instead of a request for desert, we got a check.  We figured it was a sign.  We were dividing the check into 2.  A friend who had been a server suggested that we mark the items that went on a particular card and then it was easiest for them to split the check.  We were explaining that to Justin as he was seemingly running from the table. (Did we have ebola and no one told us?)  When he accidentally put the wrong total on each card, and we asked him to switch the totals, rather than go do it, he was argumentative at the table for several minutes about how he did it right and kept trying to push fault to the friend who handed him the bill. he then stormed from the table (like a 2 yr old) saying as he went, \""""Fine, I'll just have to go switch them\"""".  Yea, that's all we'd been going for.  The whole table felt uncomfortable and insulted.  A friend noticed we were \""""dropped off\"""" to go boxes when all other tables had their food taken away and the server put them in the boxes.  I don't know if we just had an awful server or if he thought we'd be bad tippers (I've never gone under 20% for good service - bad never gets less then 15%) but it will be a long time before any of us go there again. The atmosphere was cute, but the food was not a good value and never really rose above \""""Ok\""""."""""""

<review>Average burger, average taste, above average prices. Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food. If you want cheap cheese, bland meat, and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place. I go to Columbus OH for work, Graffiti burger is the place over there. They have a big sign over the Five Guys in Columbus. I passed by the Five Guys, almost empty, go to Graffiti, PACKED. There is a reason for that, they serve the best burgers around. I so wish AZ had a place like that. Until that happens, I am in search for the best burger in AZ.

<review>I bought a new mountain bike from them in Dec 2011. The buying experience was great, my salesperson was very knowledgeable and they had the bike built in a couple of hours. \n\nMy problem was the included 90 day tuneup. They didn't do any of the work that needed to be done and gave the bike back to me with my brakes rubbing, gears not shifting correctly, and wheels that needed to be trued.\n\nAfter spending thousands of dollars on my bike and accessories I expected more. They only give one tuneup at Landis (less then many of their competitors) so I wish things would have been done correctly. I will be bringing my bike to another shop for service in the future.

<review>Sad, the photos on the web and other media are from when this place was built. Just stayed there and wow! What a crappy motel! I say crappy motel as it was like a motel, dirty carpet, mold and mildew in the bathrooms, terrible service/sarcasm from staff, erroneous fees on a incidental card, (over 300.00) for no services redered, stay away. Also, you have no opportunity to speak with management and they will continue to say they are not in.. Perhaps that is why this place is run like crap, no managment around...

<review>I have to say, I have not been impressed with most of the food I have had at the Biltmore Fashion Park and Stingray Sushi did not disappoint.  One of the worst meals and dining experiences I have had, at least in regard to sushi.  Where do I start?  Do I start with the server who helped us at the sushi bar?  She took our drink order but unfortunately it never came so we just had water which in the end was a good thing since the food did not have much flavor.  I did not think it was that tough to serve up a Coke and a beer but it proved to be a request beyond their ability.  From there it went down hill.  My two hand rolls were loosely rolled and almost fell apart as I ate them.  In addition, there was little to no flavor.  Then came the 9-11 roll and that was pretty good, though for the money it was not a lot of food.  Next my Chilean Sea Bass came and it was definitely overcooked.  I could have sent it back but at this point I just wanted to get the meal over with and leave.  What followed was the clincher that sealed the deal and allowed me to call this the absolute worst sushi I have ever had.  The last roll I had was the spider roll.  Anyone who has had a spider roll knows that it is made with soft shell crab.  Well my spider roll had plenty of shell but it certainly lacked the crab.  I have had lots of soft shell crab made many ways and hands down this was the worst.  I could never recommend Stingray Sushi at the Biltmore to anyone unless you have no clue what sushi should be.  Eat at your own peril.  If you want better sushi than what is served at Stingray, just go to your local market.  Yes, the sushi is that bad there.

<review>My roommate and I went here fir the first time today. The price was the only thing that was great. The chicken was dry, the tzatziki sauce was bland and thick, and the so called Greek dressing on my side salad tasted like cheap bottled Italian. The fries were ok, hummus was bland, and I said no onions on anything, yet onions were on EVERYTHING. needless to say, I will NOT be going here again. I can't even say that this was the McDonalds of Greek restaurants cause I would have rather eaten an McDonalds.

<review>I think this company is a bait and switch scam operation. I spoke with the owner Bill over the phone and told him I was interested in protection training for my dog. He said he could do that but it would take several years of training. And at least two sessions a week at $40 a session. He also would not see my dog until I paid a $90 consultation fee. \nSo I go to meet this guy, and he has with him a dog that is very well mannered, and he has a wrapped mini van so he looks professional...so my hopes are high...but after a few exercises with my dog. He then goes into how it will cost me $100,000.00 to train my dog and it is to late because he would have to train him from when he is a puppy, and he has to keep him for 5 years. \n\nAll stuff he failed to mention over the phone. And all information he knew in the questionnaire I filled out and returned...prior to our meeting up.  If i could rate this guy 0 stars in his business practices I would, their is no doubt he can train a dog...but so can anyone...I trained my dog on my own to do all the stupid pet tricks we get them to do...but I wanted more and this guy is a joke who took my money and ran. Truly a joke. If you go to their website it says free consultation. My consultation was not free. He guarantees he can train any dog. He basically said my dog was UN-trainable. Stay away!

<review>Went there to watch UFC fight. It was packd!  1 waitress and 1 bartender to handle the whole top floor was not acceptable.  She was running around just trying to keep up.  I felt terrible for her.  All customers around were complaining about not getting service.  I felt it was not her fault, maybe management needs to be changed.  There are enough people looking for jobs, they could have easily had 2 more servers and at least one more bartender upstairs.  We were there for an hour and I finally went to the bar and asked if we could get the waitress over, it took her at least half an hour, it wasn't that she wasn't running around working, we saw her, she finally got to us, we ordered a round of drinks (one beer and 1 vodka), a salad and chili dog.  The 1 beer came out right away, vodka?????.  The salad came out an hour later, and the chili dog a half an hour after that, it was barely warm and and no cheese.  The french fries were cold.  We finally cancelled the vodka after an hour and half waiting.  If they would just hire more people to work, that place could have made bank that night.  Management better start checking out there reviews and take some action or they will be out of business before too long.

<review>So I went there to buy the new Nook HD as a Christmas gift.I might as well have been buying a magazine for as much customer service I received. There was a display of all the Nooks, but nowhere did it say to go to register to buy it. The display, nice as it was, could not answer questions I had. This is not my first Nook purchase as it seems they come out with a new one each year, however I still had some questions. I went to the customer service counter and asked where I could find the Nooks to purchase. He curtly told me they were at the register (as if I was to have already known this). I went to the register and was helped ( well, I wouldn't really call it helped) by a woman whom I'd really like to name here, but won't. Her disinterest in my purchase was evident and I was guided in buying the wrong screen protector.  Again, this wasn't a cheap purchase, and I was the only one in line until an obvious off-duty employee came in and they exchanged their hellos. The gift was well-received, and with the gift receipt the recipient was able to exchange for the correct screen protector. This wasn't one employee giving bad customer service...this was 2. It's a no return store for me.

<review>"""If my current issues are resolved, I will revisit this review and edit. However, my current situation is this: in the past 24 hours, I have had 2 visits, taking nearly 4 hours! When making the appt, I received no information that a \contact lens exam/fitting\"""" would necessitate 2 visits. During the exam, when I hesitated having my eyes dilated, i explained to the student that I spend a lot of my work hours in the car and still had to work that afternoon. She explained that it would only affect \""""some blurriness when reading up close.\"""" Wrong!! The minute I stepped into the sun, I was rendered incapacitated and could barely keep my eyes open a bit to drive home. This necessitated my having to take 2.5 hours of PA time from my job - in addition to the 1.5 hours my exam took. I was told that the next day I would see someone specializing in contact fittings. Wrong!  The student I saw the next day was extremely nice, but had no clue what he was doing regarding the proper product, prescription, and fit. I spent 2 more hours with this student on trial-and -error contacts. The doctor looked in on us twice for less than a 5 minute total. Again, she was very nice but nothing was being accomplished. They sent me on my way with a trial pair of lenses that I had to remove and throw away 3 hours later because I could not drive in them......everything was blurry and driving was not safe! Did I mention I TOLD them that I drive a lot in my job???? I have worn lenses before, and all my friends my age wear lenses, so I am assuming this is possible with the proper expertise.....but that is the one thing I am not getting. I have been \""""invited\"""" to go back tomorrow and have no idea if I will do that. Neither will I pay for a service I did not receive.\nUpdate, 6/21/12: I returned to my previous optician, which I previously thought to be over-priced. They fitted me perfectly with a different prescription in each eye, and I have been wearing contacts daily since. In the future, I would only use Midwestern for frames, as they have a good selection."""""""

<review>"""Too bad this Mill Ave. district reviewing isn't separated into different eras.  I preferred the pre-Millenial Ave. days, such as the early 90's right when the expansion started and it was \the place\"""" with fresh shops that were all OPEN, and fewer of those annoying homeless people asking for money or tampons.   This was when the Coffee Plantation was locally owned, had coffee carts on campus at ASU, and the coffee was actually somewhat good.  Mill had so much traffic of people cruising that the police had crude anti-cruising measures set up to reduce the traffic.  Even though I never ate at Long Wong's and a few others that are gone, it is sad to see them not there.  No... SLICES and THE LIBRARY don't cut it for me."""""""

<review>My decided to go there in Friday night. The place was empty. We arrived at 830 and had to seat ourselves on the patio because the hostess was not there. The waitresses outside, who kept looking our way, didnt bring us over a menu or take our drink orders until 9. Finally we got to order our drinks which never showed up. Finally at 920 we decided to walk out. With the economy how it is and with the amount of traffic there one would think they would be starving for our business. That obviously wasnt the case.

<review>AMF Mesa Lanes is very similar in fashion to all of the AMF bowling lanes around the country that I have been to.  There are a couple of distinct reasons to why I give a lower rating. The overall service was okay because it seemed to take longer than usual to get us going to bowling.  There were not too many people that night.  Lastly, they took away our pitchers of beer at least 30 minutes before close.  I am not sure if this is protocol, but we had a designated driver and our drunk friends could have finished the beer.

<review>"""This place is terrible.  The people who work there are rude and unattentive.  I am a marathon runner and have started using a brand of fuel that is sold at very few places, and they have the best selection.\n\nAgainst every fiber of my being, I had to give this place some additional business, despite my terrible experiences purchasing accessories prior.  MY MISTAKE.  \n\nI rolled up to the shop after a long strenuous hill run and was in desperate need for some recovery fuel (within that critical 60 minutes).  Low and behold I had just missed them since they closed at 6pm.  But one of the guys was there running a spin class outside and let me in - pretty nice, I thought!\n\nI popped in, grabbed what I needed and headed up to the counter.  I apologized to the guy working in there, saying I recognized they were closed and I really appreciated it.  Not only do I get zero response, but I get zero acknowledgment.  No eye contact, no \hi, I'll be right with you,\"""" not even a \""""lady wait your turn,\"""" nothing.  Like I didn't exist.\n\nSo, I patiently stood at the counter with my 3 packets while the employee poked around the repair area, avoiding me, waiting for the customers ahead of me to shop around.  I could see there was zero chance he was going to talk to me, much less ring me up, while he waited for them to look at shirts, shoes, saddles, you name it.\n\nAfter 20 minutes (no joke, 20 minutes) of standing around completely unacknowledged, I threw the packets on the counter and walked out.  The spin class guy outside watched me leave, empty handed.  Who knows if he did the math on the lost sale, because not only will I never purchase fuel from them again, I will go elsewhere when I decide to buy a road bike.\n\nI now order all of my fuel online.  So much for patronizing a local business."""""""

<review>I really wanted to like this place, but the service just ruined it. \n\nI went on a sunday afternoon, when it really wasn't that busy. I was sitting directly at the bar and still got poor service. The server walked by probably 5 times while my glass set empty before she made eye contact with me. It was a bit ridiculous. \n\nI feel like the yardhouse had just as many (if not more) taps, with the same prices and better service. \n\nGreat decor though, very tall open ceilings and lots of TVs. Just don't expect good service.

<review>"""Having spotted a $28 Dior Addict (Stiletto... a word that sounds sexy, yet dangerous... recall Fonda's Single White Female) I really wanted days ago at Sephora, I decided to check out two department store makeup counters to see if they were offering a \gift w/ purchase.\""""  (Turned out that the \""""gift w/ purchase\"""" promotion will not be offered till September.)  Macy's turned out to be my first and my last stop that day due to time constraints, the way I was treated, and the fact that the Macy's rep behind the Dior counter quoted me a lower price for the lipsticks I wanted to purchase- I was going to buy at least two ( Stiletto and Envy), and I also started looking into the $30 Rouge Dior colors and the $34 Serum Rouge selections.  Since I am not fond of returning tainted lipsticks, I proceeded to sample some of the testers using the disposable brushes they have for customers to use.  It wasn't long before a woman permanently parked herself behind and to the right of me where I could see her. Even though I greeted her a nice hello and continued to sample colors, after awhile, I felt so uncomfortable, that I decided I'd just stick to the two choices I initially made, since I can always come back if I ended up liking the products.  \n\nThe original rep rang my purchases up, and the total was higher than I estimated it to be.  I asked her why, and she said that she'd looked at another product's tag when I had asked her earlier for the price.  Since it was only a few dollars, I decided I'd let it go, and left Macy's.  \n\nI returned to Sephora a few days later to restock on Clinique colors that I love.  I always buy three or more of these at a time to eventually replace the almost-new ones I have already, since the bases fall prey to Arizona's heat and break off.  (I don't have the patience, nor the time, to save these broken pieces in pots and apply them on w/ lipstick brushes.  I wish I did, for I would then have the extra cash to spend on my other hobbies of dining out and watching movies at Camelview!)  Anyhoo, I ended up buying five colors, which amounted to around $77, including tax (three for me, and two to gift Mom w/, because I like her).\n\nSee Macy's?  If you didn't make me feel like I was a marked crook by sending your guard, who was ready to jump me at the slightest move, I'd have spent so much more money splurging on my favorite makeup items at your counters, rather than at other stores.  I'm not even pondering on how the rep mislead me by quoting the wrong price-- OK I will... How could she do that when I specifically gave her the product's line and color to look up?  Nevermind.  I'm making it a point to boycott this particular location.  Should I ever want to buy anything from a Macy's, I'll either go to the one in Chandler, or to another state even!  Perhaps I'll just spend my money at Dillard's and Sephora."""""""

<review>"""The host staff was very warm and welcoming when walking in to a surprising dark lobby.  After waiting a few mintues we were sat for our reservation in the back corner by the windows.  Or server came by soon after and was all smiles but in an over the top confused look sort of way.  She offered sparking or flat when we ask for flat she brought out Fiji -- normally at nicer restaurants this is complimentary but we spent $24 on water which was a suprise given it was never mentioned.  The server was all too eager to keep pushing for the up sale and the add on it was very annoying.  We ordered one bottle of wine for the three at the table drinking and she insisted we get two bottles, etc.  We poured all of our own wine after the first pour, so I never did bother to order another one....\n\nThe food, I can only speak for the taste of my own food, but all 7 of us were fighting for the bathroom later that night (sorry probably too much information).  I started with the Caprese salad which was small and not refreshing.  I got one slice of tomato and one slice of Buffalo Mozzarella garnish with a handful of dry spring greens that sat in vinegar.  For dinner I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass \Hong Kong\"""" style which was aromatic and had good flavors but the fish itself didn't seem as fresh as it could of been.  Maybe it was because it was steamed it didn't fall apart like what I was used to... I'm not sure.\n\nThis place was nothing special thats for sure, good wine list though and the bar area did look fun unfortunately we didn't both to stay and check that out."""""""

<review>Great food  and  great service when ordering as always :-)\n\nNow ask to use the restroom after 12midnight  and  their A+ customer service does a 180  and  goes to down right rude.  I was honestly surprised at how disrespectful their staff was when I asked why their restrooms were closed  and  when I inquired more about the policy 3 staff members were so down right rude I simply walked out.\n\nThis location needs a serious attitude adjustment, which is too bad cause the food itself is great!

<review>"""Extremely disappointed in this place... I brought my sister and a friend who were both in town from New York. Our waiter was full of inappropriate comments, starting with calling our male friend \Hugh\"""" and asking if he was looking for a third girl now that Kendra had left. He later told my sister she looked like Caroline Kennedy, which is NOT a compliment. (Smart woman, very nice, but definitely not a looker. Kennedy, not my sister.) I appreciate friendly, cheerful service, but not ill-thought conversation.\n\nWe started our meals with salads. The house dressing has a distinctive fishy taste, despite being told there were no anchovies in it. There were wilted pieces of lettuce on my plate, and the walnuts were not chopped making it difficult to pick up with a fork at the same time as any of the wilted lettuce.\n\nMy entree was equally as disappointing. I ordered the lasagna, generally a safe choice on a maiden voyage at an Italian restaurant. Unfortunately, this time that was not the case. There were at least a dozen layers of lasagna noodles, making the dish very pasty. Between the layers there was barely any sauce, no discernable meat and zero cheese. I ate barely a quarter of it, yet now, three hours later, I still feel like there is a brick sitting in my stomach.\n\nMy sister ordered the veal parm, despite my story of being stared at by an adorable baby cow on the back of a dairy truck for ten miles in traffic one day. She soon regretted her choice as much as I regretted my lasagna. Mushy and bland, she also barely ate half her dish - and only a forkful of the greasy side dish of pasta served with it.\n\nOur friend ordered a shrimp and pasta dish, which he found adequate. He was please that the shrimp were as large as they were and that there were a lot of them, but he still didn't feel the dish wowed him enough to pay $25 for it.\n\nI finished with a dessert of a ricotta-based cheesecake with lemon curd topping. This too was adequate, as long as the filling and topping was eaten after being scraped off the mushy, bitter bottom layer (one could barely call it a crust).\n\nWe finished our meal at 8 PM on a Sunday night, and we were the only patrons in the establishment. That in itself told us a lot.\n\nI know this place has been open since the '80s, but I'm not sure how. We won't be returning again."""""""

<review>I am a regular but three major mistakes were made in my visit.  Ran out of Uni (Sea Urchin),  the salmon eggs were filled with sake (a trick that sushi chef used to cover up the spoilage of the caviar-Can't lie to a former chef like myself), and avocado eel roll served without the eels inside.  Had to complained about mistake number #3..Was fixed but still very sub-standard.  It takes years to train someone to have the precision and allowing amateur Hispanic female sushi chef (major break in tradition--In Japan, they will never allow woman to touch sushi) at a busy restaurant is a major disappointment.  I am not a sexist but to serve a sub-standard product to anyone is unacceptable.  Service was nice so I would have to think very hard to return again.

<review>I usually go to a different, nearby Chinese restaurant for dim sum. But, somebody recommended Phoenix Palace to me instead, saying that it put the other place to shame. Uh, wrong! It's the exact opposite actually.\n\nThe selection of dim sum at lunchtime on a Tuesday was dismal. A handful of dishes, and they seemed quite unwilling to prepare anything they didn't have already in the cart. The items I did try were quite lacking in quality and flavor...although they did seem to be somewhat fresh (to their credit).\n\nIf you're looking for delicious dim sum--and a good selection of it--try someplace else. Phoenix Palace is not the place to go. I won't return.

<review>Car dealerships tend to get bad ratings. They are well known for their pushy sales and secret tactics- no doubt about that. \n\nI purchased my Hyundai when this dealership was under different ownership. The sales process was like any other dealership. But I know what I'm doing and knew what I wanted. \n\nI love my vehicle. Service dept used to be great. They had a service director there (Tim) who was excellent and worked as an advisor for years. \n\nNow I go in for warranty work and they simply don't treat you with the respect I used to know. They have good points but bad ones too. Even an oil change takes forever ! No dealership is great but the service dept is what keeps a customer a customer. Unorganized and have an attitude. I would be even more mad if it wasn't warranty work and it came from my pocket. \n\nSadly it seems like other local Hyundai service depts are this way too. Infiniti, Acura, honda are all excellent in the service dept. Earnhardt Hyundai needs to take lessons from them.

<review>"""I'm definitely not the type of person who likes to give merely 1 star... but after my experience here, it's hard to give it anything more.  The only thing going for it really was the view... too bad though that it was too dark to see the water.\n\nWe went here for my birthday dinner a few nights ago.  Walked in, nice decor, but were greeted by the smirk of a man who was looking down his nose at us - especially since we didn't have a reservation.  The place wasn't busy... maybe half full, if that.  We waited patiently for about 20 minutes to be seated.\n\nThe waitress was... somewhat polite; I mean, she did try to cater her suggestions to her audience.  I'm Japanese, but you know... just because I am doesn't mean that you need to suggest all the Asian dishes as specialties.  She did the same racial profiling to the table next to us of Italians.  While I understand her meaning behind it and I'm sure she didn't mean to be offensive, I just found it odd.  Unfortunately, she also didn't know anything at all about the wines, but I made a selection we enjoyed anyhow. \n\nWe ordered the calamari as the app and it came out cold.  I personally have never enjoyed cold fried items, but hey that's me.  I'm not all that sure how long it had been sitting in the window, but since it took about 30 minutes to arrive at the table I assume a while.  The whole night it felt as though our waitress was avoiding us since the calamari sat nearly untouched for at least 15 minutes until she came by with my friend's clam chowder soup.  The soup he said was good, but I found it slightly inexcusable that she kept walking past our table and looking at the untouched appetizer whilst she continued to service the table next to us to her fullest extent. For our entrees, he ordered shrimp 3 ways and I ordered a simple shrimp and crab pasta.  His was overcooked to the point of rubber and mine made me feel ill immediately after consumption.  We both decided to skip out on desserts due to the awful service and poor food quality.  \n\nOne thing that upsets me is when a restaurant ruins its ingredients and this one did.  Go for the soup and nothing else.  If you expect even a smidgen of decent service, don't even bother. It's over priced and pretentious for food that is improperly prepared.  Before exiting the establishment I had to excuse myself in order to \go bulimic\"""" and my friend felt incredibly sick the next day.  Stomachs beware!"""""""

<review>I got a quick to go Asian Salad.  Read the ingredients, no bell peppers (i'm allergic.)  Awesome.  Run like Oj to terminal B to catch my connecting and sit down to eat.  There were at least 15 slices of red bell pepper that i had to pick out.  This usually does the trick.  I guess since it was packaged, it tainted the rest of the salad.  Yep.  Instant allergic reaction.  Would not have wanted to sit next to me on the plane.\n\nIt was tasty fresh and fast.  Please check your labels, Blanco.  Spare me and others that might be allergic to unlisted ingredients.

<review>"""THE OWNER LITERALLY STEPPED IN FRONT OF ME, BLOCKED MY PASSAGE, GOT IN MY FACE, AND CONFRONTED ME. \n\nSorry for how long this is, but I hope you take the time to read it. \n\nIf my phone wasn't so slow, I would've posted this review while actually sitting inside Kokomo. I'm actually still upset just thinking about this experience, because I've never had a \business owner\"""" be so rude to me. I was meeting up with an old friend I haven't seen in a while in the shopping center that Kokomo is in, and I saw it and we decided to go have some frozen yogurt. Upon entering and staring at the choices for a while, I saw that there are small sample cups up by the register. I'm usually an icecream type of person, so I was wanting to make sure I actually chose a flavor that I liked. I don't know about everyone else, but I'm not going to spend my money on a cup of frozen yogurt that I end up not even liking. Also, at the normal icecream shops, you can sample basically as many as you want.\n\nSo, after having 3 samples (cheesecake, cake batter, and chocolate), I saw that they had raspberry pomegranate. I went back to get another sample cup, and upon walking back to the yogurt machines, the owner literally stepped right in front of me, blocked my passage, (\""""got in my face\"""", if you will), and confronted me by saying \""""Are you serious, how many samples have you had?\""""\n\nI was extremely taken aback, because that is not only the most unprofessional, but also the RUDEST, I have ever had an employee, let alone business owner speak to me before. I told him this was going to be my 4th sample, and he scoffed and started waving his hands around acting as if I had been trying to steal his product by only getting samples. He told me as a business owner he can't have people \""""just sitting around all day eating free samples.\""""\n\nI'm not a business owner...but here's a suggestion. How about saying \""""Just so you know, we have a sample limit of 3-4 per person. My personal favorite is _______, and if you like cheesecake, definitely try the cheesecake fro-yo with graham cracker crumbs!\""""\n\nOn top of this, he had also stopped my friend right before he stopped me, again by getting up in her space and physically blocking her from walking anywhere. \n\nSince when is it ever okay to be that confrontational and invade someone's space like that?\n\nHe embarrassed me in front of the entire store and treated me so badly that I'm extremely surprised he actually still has a business. Had my friend not already gotten a cup of frozen yogurt, I would have walked out. This is completely unacceptable.\n\nIf he was so upset about people taking samples, then maybe he shouldn't have the cups free for the taking. Make it so that you have to ask a cashier for a sample cup.\n\nAlso, calling yourself a \""""business owner\"""" during the same interaction where you get in my face, try to block my way to my seat, confront me in such a rude way, and then don't even let me speak because you're too busy scolding me with your hands on your hips as if you're a mother yelling at a child- is laughable and makes me wonder if you are actually that clueless about customer service."""""""

<review>"""This is one of those places that's hit or miss depending on when you're there.  Unfortunately there's no way to predict when it will be a hit.  The first time we were there was on a sweltering Friday evening.  The food was great, the service was good and the AC was cold.  What more could you ask for.  \nThe second visit was on a Thursday night and it was about as busy as you would expect for mid-week.  The food was still good, but the service left much to be desired.  It seemed like taking our order was low on our waitresses list of priorities.  And delivering what we ordered was even less important.  We never did get the salads we ordered and the machiotto we ordered with dessert was actually delivered after we had finished.  All I can say is the waitress is absolutely clueless.  Nice hat though.  \nOne amusing aside.  The owner was schmoozing with another table saying he had politicos coming in all the time.  The mayor, the Governor, etc.  I'm thinking 'Yeah, sure pal.\  And in walks the Attorney General.  So I gotta give him that one.  \nThe prices are reasonable, and as long as you're not a snob the food is good, but be willing to roll the dice on the service."""""""

<review>Let me start by saying that the tailors are incredibly kind and helpful. They were able to alter some of my dresses quite well (doing simple alterations). However, when it came to altering some suits, I was really disappointed. One of the suit jackets, which was originally too large, was know misshapen and disproportionate. One pair of dress pants was extremely unflattering after the alteration, being too tight around the pant seat/hip area.\n\nI spent over $100 on alterations and would say that half of them either do not help or have made the garment worse. For simple hems, I would go to AJ Tailors, but for anything else, I would look elsewhere.

<review>On a 6-hour flight to Hawaii, US Airways ran out of food! We were starving, because we didn't have time to grab food before the flight, so we were expecting to be able to purchase food once in the air. Since we were sitting in the back of the plane, all of the food was gone by the time they rolled their cart to us. Our lunch consisted of chips, almonds and cookies; these were basically our rations for 6 hours. Our first four choices of real food (ex: sandwich, salad, cheese/fruit, etc), were sold out. Plus, the flight attendants were less than friendly (to be fair, maybe it was just one in particular that was having a very bad day). Overall, we often dislike our experiences with US Airways, and will avoid them as much as possible.

<review>Went here through Deal Chicken...$59 for $144 worth of food with a bottle of wine, seemed like a great deal - unfortunately, it wasn't.  White the food and service were both good - portions were miniscule.  We both had mussels as an appetizer, and were given a 1/2 portion each, with about 8-10 mussels.  The main course was OK, but the side pasta was less than about a cup's worth.  Dessert was cheesecake - it was a half-portion cut into two slices- enough for 3 forkfuls.  So, what seemed like a great deal was a huge disappointment.  In these struggling times I can understand that restaurants need customers, but to say they are giving $144 worth of food when dividing portions in less than half left us feeling ripped off.  Perhaps if they would have disclosed beforehand that the portions were smaller than the regular menu this would have been a different type of review.  It has certainly given me pause to consider something like this in the future - before purchasing it might be a good idea to contact the restaurant and ask.....live and learn.

<review>Food is good but their advertisement is false. I recently purchased their 5 mini tacos with a drink for 4.99. When he rings it up it was 5.98. Really dude - 97 cents in tax on a 5 dollar meal? Turns out they are ringing up each taco at the regular price of $1.09 which comes to 5.45 not 4.99. It's a trivial amount I know but its all about principal. It says 4.99 but apparently you like to charge 5.45. And to top it all off the guy says theirs nothing he can do about it. Uh yeah how bout ringing it up for the advertised price.

<review>I went there for lunch and was exciting about eating there.  I have never been to the restaurant and when I walked in I was impressed with the layout of the restaurant.  Our waiter was friendly and came over right away to offer us drinks. \n\nThe menu is rather pricey so I decided to order a chicken waldorf salad and my co-worker ordered a chicken caesar salad.  When we received our salads the first thing we noticed was that the chicken was pink in both of the salads and it appeared that it had not been cooked enough.  The chicken caesar salad is supposed to come with croutons and it did not.  The chicken waldorf salad was ok but the pinkness in the chicken did bother me.  My co-worker and I should have sent the salads back.  \n\nAfter we got back to the office, we both commented that our stomachs were a little queasy.  I will definitely not be back to the restaurant.  It is way over priced and I believe that if you are going to pay more for your food it should be amazing.  I can make a better salad at home.  Overall I was disappointed with my first dining experience at Hillstone.

<review>Talk about a disappointment. Restaurant week is something that my close group of friends looks forward to every year. It's a great time to experience something special from a restaurant we have not tried before. Our expectations were high are that the food and service would be impeccable since Restaurant Week is a showcase for creativity. Unfortunately, it was not the case this year. We had a reservation for 10 for Saturday evening. We were promptly seated at a long, comfortable table. However, things went down from there. First off, there were wine substitutions for the meal pairings. The pairing ($10 additional or $5 a glass) was a bargain, but the replacement wines did not match well with the food. The appetizers were a disappointment across the board. I heard negative comments about the ceviche and the corn chowder. I had the goat cheese fondue along with several others (with high praise from the server).  We all commented on its unpleasant, non-fondue-like texture and the tasteless crackers that accompanied it. The entrees fared no better. The salmon was overcooked, the tortellini was bland and the skirt steak was tough and not very favorable as skirt steaks usually are. The worst thing (noted by several others) was an artichoke and leek gratin. It was thick and dry as spackle and the worst item of the night. Nothing came out at the proper temperature. Dessert was an afterthought with a mini sampling of mediocre selections placed on a plate with no flair whatsoever. Though we enjoyed each other's company, we were completely disappointed at this subpar experience. Most said they would not come back based on this experience.

<review>Wow, I was.expecting a 4-star resort, but that's what I get for reading reviews on priceline and not yelp.  While the staff was mostly great, the room was not.  Over powering smell of air freshener - seriously like being in a laundromat in Mexico.  You know that detergent smell?  That was our room.  And they couldn't move us from it because supposedly they were booked.  Seriously, every room?  Even leaving the window open for six hours didn't help.  I have no idea what an asthmatic would do.  I suspect it's because we booked via Priceline.  For the money, Gainey Ranch would be a way better bet and you won't need eye drops or to wash your clothes when you leave.

<review>I've had Grimaldi's saved in my bookmarks for awhile, and this Saturday I found an excuse to go. Family dinner night! I was in charge of figuring out where to eat and since we were all craving pizza and my mom was paying, I chose this place. By the end of the night, most of my family was a little ticked off at me for my choice. \n\nI was super excited to try this place based on the reviews, and I am really sad that it did not live up to my expectations. I was literally expecting some of the best pizza I have ever had in my life. We come in around 7pm and its busy but we still manage to get a table right away. None of us order drinks because I think we all looked at the price of the pizza and figured this was going to be pretty expensive. We decided on two small pizzas: one half pepperoni (for my sister) and half mushroom, the other with the sweet roasted red peppers. \n\nThe service was a little strange. Our waiter didn't make eye contact all night. He looked at other tables, at his paper, or down at the floor when he talked to us. Was there something on our faces? I don't know, but it was really odd. The guy that delivered the pizzas to our table was nice though, and he served us all our first slice. I thought that was a nice touch. He was also very willing to get us new plates right away when the ones at our table were dirty. \n\nThe pizzas did not take long to come out, but I was a little surprised by them when they did. I literally couldn't tell the pepperoni or the red peppers from the sauce. The pepperonis were the tiniest I have ever seen. I didn't get any feedback from my sister or my husband on whether or not these were any good, so I am assuming they were either ok, or kind of boring. The mushrooms were flavorless and really thin. I think on my slice of pizza there were four mushrooms. Sad day, I love mushrooms. I am a little bit bothered by the fact that they still charge you $2 per topping even if you only get it on half of the pizza. Considering as well the toppings were tiny and hard to see. The red peppers were even more of a let down. $4 for that option as a topping. They were flavorless as well. And again, really sparse. The pizzas in general were really lacking in the flavor department. I tasted no specific spices, let alone no salt. The cheese was really bland as well. How can you have bland mozzarella? It seemed impossible to me. \n\nSo by the end of the meal my whole family was annoyed with me because we could have gone to any other pizza place and gotten 3 times as much pizza for half the price. Two small pizzas with essentially two (marginal) toppings cost $40. No drinks, no wine, no salad, no desert. My mom didn't say it, but she wasn't happy either, since she paid. Sorry mom, but don't worry I wont make that mistake again.

<review>Yelpers...please rate these places accurately! I wanted a burger, so i looked on yelp to see the highest rated places were. I went in and ordered a double with cheese and the works. After the 1st bite, I knew i lost 8 bucks. \n\nThis was not worthy of a 4 star. Mushrooms tasted like they got it out of a can and the burger meat wasn't appealing. I asked for medium well and it wasn't cooked correctly. When it comes to burgers, I don't joke around. \n\nThis place has nothing on 5 guys. Totally unsatisfactory. \n\nI will try it again, to make sure I get a good reading.

<review>Very disappointing! My boyfriend and I are from Austin, Texas and we were so excited to visit Jimmy Buffets Margaitaville only to be greeted with horrible customer service. The hostesses told us we can seat ourselves outside which is understandable, but we sat there for 10 minutes without being greeted by a waiter and it wasn't even busy. I told the hostess we havent been waited on and told her where we were sitting and she looked confused and said okay. 20 minutes later we got up and told them we would go eat somewhere else and the hostesses that were his standing there said okay in a sarcastic way. I was so dissapointed because we even had our food picked out because we looked at the menu online and wanted to visit the gift shop to buy some Jimmy Buffet souveniers. We worked retail and understand the wait and how customer service works but this was absolutely a horrible experience! Sad to say that considering we are Jimmy Buffet fans.

<review>"""I have such conflict leaving a 1 star review for Uncle Sal's. Why? Because I LOVE Uncle Sal's food. I have been eating here off and on for years and live close by. Make no mistake; it's some of the tastiest Italian fare around--I have never had a bad meal. The problem? A cockroach infestation. Yes--infestation. One need only keep ones eyes open. In June, I went to eat for my birthday. As we were sitting awaiting our meal, a small cockroach scurried across our table. Ok--one measly roach--I can handle that as an anomaly. But when I went back again in about 4 weeks with a friend for lunch, we waited in a back booth (for 20 minutes I might add) for someone to take our order (that's a whole other story--seems the lunch wait staff becomes somewhat frazzled when they get a rush--an acknowledgement, or a simple \haven't forgotten about you, will be right there\"""" would have sufficed)--we sat waiting and as we both looked at the brick wall over the heads of a table of some gentlemen having a biz lunch, we both noticed 2-3 little roaches darting in and out of the cracks of the wall. My friend and I simultaneously said: \""""are you seeing what I am seeing?\"""" And agreed in unison to leave. As we passed our apparition of a wait person on our way out, I informed this person that we were leaving and why. She simply looked at me with very little expression and said (I kid you not) \""""oh, I know we have roaches, they are just active because we sprayed recently\"""". I informed her that one scurried across my table a month ago as well. She just shrugged. Sigh. Sorry to do this to you Uncle Sal's, but until you can have someone get in there and bomb the place, And claim you are roach free, I simply have no interest in sharing my meal with an army of 6 legged buggies. I can only imagine how many of them could be lurking in the kitchen and I am no wuss. Beware. Sad state of affairs. I miss you, Uncle Sal's, but not that much."""""""

<review>"""Terrible food.  The beef ribs were super salty, and they cost $5.50 PER RIB now.  Their new menu doesn't even have a price for beef ribs, it says \Market Price,\"""" so the sky's the limit on how much Stacy can charge for them.  And they only accept cash, no credit cards, so bring plenty of $$$.\n\nThe ribs were not smoky at all.  I thought this place was called a \""""Smokehouse.\""""  Not the ribs I guess.\n\nThe Mac N Cheese was from a Kraft box.  The cheese biscuits were burned.  The fried pickles weren't fried, only dipped in raw cornmeal so they were gritty and dry.\n\nWe won't be back."""""""
</review>
<review>"""Ugh. We absolutely hated our experience here. When we first arrived, the host (who was standing outside at a stand) called us \sir\"""" and \""""madam,\"""" which I thought was a little peculiar but not in and of itself annoying. Little did I know that ~32 minutes later, we'd look back and think of his misplaced etiquette as the only positive thing about our dining experience at Dragonfly. The service was totally unimpressive, especially given that the restaurant wasn't at all crowded, and the $4 happy-hour-special Long Islands were more sour mix than alcohol, but what really turned us off was the overly sweet, sugary, and poorly-thought-out food. \n\nWe started with the \""""Mill Avenue\"""" appetizer sampler. The only real standout was the cream-cheese filled puffs (ironically, the least authentic item) - the other items, including the sauce, were just off. The spare ribs were dry, the paper wrapped around the spring rolls was tough (telltale sign that they hadn't been freshly made), and the sauces were watery and had no zest at all. We eagerly looked forward to our entrees but when they came and we tried them, we found ourselves wishing for the flavorless and subpar - but not disgusting - appetizers. My husband had the mango beef - I used to work at a Vietnamese fusion restaurant where this was featured on the menu, and there, it consisted of thinly sliced beef with tender pieces of mango and a oyster sauce. Here, it was fatty chunks of beef with underripe mango in a sickeningly sweet, sticky sauce mixed up with a bunch of unrelated \""""sauteed\"""" veggies. My yellow curry chicken and shrimp tasted less like a complex curry and more like a meat and veggie mixture (think bad Chinese) tossed in a paper bag with a whole jar of curry powder. \n\nWhen the waiter came to clear our almost-full plates, he asked if everything was ok. Our philosophy is usually to say something in response to that question only if something is fixable (e.g., a meat can be redone to be less well-done). In this case, the whole restaurant concept seems to be centered on serving flavorless and poor-quality large portions to a university crowd they seem to think is un-discerning. With so much wrong, a complete overhaul would be necessary. And, so...we said \""""We're just full. Thanks!\"""" and got the hell out of there!"""""""

<review>"""Was it just me?  I tried two different beers here and they both were bitter.  The one that was supposed to taste like Blue Moon didn't.  \nThis place seems to have a few locations, so someone is drinking this beer; but, as a beer lover, it won't be me unless they prove to me that they have one beer that is not so bitter.  I'm not into the beer bite thang at all.\nYes, I realize some people just loooove their garlic fries, but, for me, the smell was so overwhelming it was making me sick..and they weren't even my fries but my friends.  I tried pushing them so far from my nose as possible...just sickening to me.  \nNow to the food:  I ordered the pork sliders as an appetizer.  The pork was ok but the buns were kinda hard like they had sat out for an hour with no cover.  Huh?  That never happens at a restaurant and my friend (another good cook) had the same.\nThe service was fine, the location is great, the waiters were friendly...but I just don't like their beer or food all that much.  \nUnfortunately, Gordon, I have to give you a \meh\"""" and 2 stars.  I do so much want to love you but sometimes it just doesn't happen....sigh.\nReminds me of different guys who looked great on paper but I just could...not...get...into........yeah, been there, done that."""""""

<review>Terrible happy hour sushi menu!\n\nAte here on the 20th after a long bout (at least a year?).  The same two chefs, Julio and Roberto, were still there, as well as Leo, the manager.  I re-informed them about my allergies and placed my order: spicy tuna ($4.50), spicy salmon ($4.50), and a soft-shelled crab roll ($7.95).  Julio prepared the first two, while Roberto prepared the crab.  I was fortunate enough to ask Roberto what he was going to substitute the * w/.  He said he could use radishes and yamagobo (pickled burdock; looks like julienned carrots).  Had I not said anything, I may have been disappointed w/ the crab roll as I was w/ the other two rolls... The tuna and salmon were pretty much just rice and the mashed fish filling.  I ate a few pcs. of each dish and gave up.  (Hey, I was hungry!!)  Had leftovers packed, then decided I'd say something to Leo, who was kind enough to comp. one of the entrees.  Fair enough, since I ate the equivalent of one.  Should I return again for happy hour, I'll probably just stick to two rolls- the dependable soft-shelled crab roll, w/c is wrapped in nori, then rice, and then w/ omelet, thin-sliced.  Yum!  \n\nSince I didn't enjoy the other two sushi rolls, I replaced them w/ a rainbow roll ($8.95), w/c originally consists of salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and shrimp, w/ avocado and cucumber.  Mine came w/o certain items, but still was pretty tasty, and definitely more colorful, and more texturally-satiating than the mashed disasters that were the salmon and tuna sushi.\n\nProbably won't be returning anytime soon for happy hour.  Certainly not since I've found a new place for happy hour sushi... Tempe's Sushi 101!
</review>
<review>Went a bit after happy hour with a few friends. The server was quite nice and helpful at first but he was a tad forgetful. I mentioned a sushi roll to my friend since it looked interesting (neither of us wanted to try it and told the server this) but he brought it out anyway. He did not charge us for it though so that was alright.\n\nThe main reasons for the low stars is that although the variety of sushi is great, they don't make it that well. Also the use of sesame seeds on top of every roll is unneeded. The soy sauce was bland and not the brand it said it was. Also when one of my friends was eating their sushi roll they found a bone in their yellow tail.\n\nNot an experience I wish to repeat. The only reason they get 2 stars is because the server was quite nice about everything.

<review>"""We have eaten at the Picazzo's in Tempe/Chandler (Warner and Kyrene) several times and enjoy their organic menu which is always delicious.  That's what we THOUGHT we were going to get with this place.  In fact, we chose it because someone in our party was on an organic vegan diet.  No such luck.  As soon as we sat down, the server said, \You know we're not organic, right?  We're different than the Picazzo's in Phoenix.\""""  Uh, no.  But we were there, so we tried to make the best of it.  The food was disappointing and unremarkable.  The service was attentive, but uninspired -- no real energy.  There were a few tables with people outside on the patio, but we were the only party inside.  When they seated us in an empty restaurant with plenty of choices, the put us right next to the swinging door of the kitchen because it was a round top that easily sat five.  They could have pulled another two-top up to a four top in the corner and the seating would have been much more pleasurable for us.  We were embarrassed as we had raved about the place to our family whom we were visiting in Casa Grande, and made a point to go there for the organic food.  We will definitely NOT be back (nor will they) and have told several people about this, as well."""""""

<review>Update.......... \nUghhhhhhhhhh as it happens like oh so many times this place now really has gone down hill.I had just given it a real great review on 12/20/10 and when we went there yesterday for mothers day lunch IT WAS AWFUL.!!! \nWhy,why,why dammit! do restaurant owner ruin a good thing when it's going well,eveytime i have been there it has been busy and i had been there at all different times of the day and week to see how the food was to compare it each time.This time the appetizer was terrible fried chix toast was greasy,fish cakes tasted old,the spring rolls were inedible.Chix sate was made w/dark meat and the peanut sauce was too runny and flavorless,Phad Thai was bland w/no tofu or eggs(they're actually charging $1.50 for a single egg to add) i had the green curry w/ chix and it was runny and flavorless as well.It really SUCKED!!!! and we wont be going back anytime soon.

<review>Inefficient and tragic result of Phoenix's best tax payer shakedown, money laundering scheme passed off as a 'public project' to date. I cannot even find any snark or humor in how bad this is anymore. Soul = crushed. \n\n* Way too expensive, further discouraging or removing services from the disabled and working poor. Crap implementation and utilization has raised transit costs for public options across the board in These Tough Economic Times, making the already broken system more of a joke than ever before. Impressive! \n\n* Way too slow, going with the flow of traffic in a suburb is pathetic and overlapping bus routes can be faster. \n\n* Obnoxious and rude students for ASU heavy stops in Tempe and Downtown, taking up all the seats in a row, who will not move when asked, who bring beach cruisers into the non-bike carriages despite room elsewhere. \n\nIt is... Just everything that one would expect to happen if public transit, light rail were to be implemented in a backwards Sunbelt suburban cesspool full of unduly narcissistic and entitled subhumans. \n\nNot. A. Fan. \n\nThis is from someone who likes taking the bus and public transit, someone who likes talking to strangers (even strange ones) on public transit, but this someone also has experienced way better service and planning from BART, MARTA and the whole of NYC. My expectations were low to begin with, considering how long I have lived in PHX-metro, but when the bottom gets blown out of expecting the least that still hurts!

<review>After moving back to the area from Cali I needed somewhere  to get my acrylics done. I usually like to get some kind of design or unique tips. After walking in I saw some tips I liked so I decided to try out this place. The first visit was bad the nail tech would not listen to the length of nails I was requesting and did a terrible job at shaping them. I always give people more than one chance so I went back and this time I got a pedicure first then the nail tech left the salon and I sat near the dryer for 45  min before approaching the manager about the length of time I had been waiting for a fill. He replied unapologetically that the tech had to leave to pick up her son from school... I sat another 15 min before I was seen by someone else. They also did a poor job. I will not spend my money somewhere that they do not value their customers. Not to mention they did a crap job and were overpriced when it came to designs and tips with prints on them. Don't waste your time here.

<review>DH  and  I arrived around 6:30 and had reservations for 7pm, but wanted to have a drink at the bar to celebrate our anniversary, before dinner. We sat down at our table around 7, and asked for the summer menu, that was listed on the website. The waiter stated that the menu is not applicable for Saturdays. I stated that on the website it does not seem to differentiate. We proceeded to order off of the regular menu, we ordered 2 appetizers- buffalo mozzarella crostini, and tortilla soup- both were ok. For entrees we had the chicken jidori and the salmon. The chicken was moist, but lacked flavor, the salmon was ok, but really lacked any texture, the tomatoes, and gnocchi all blended together with the same texture of the salmon. We then had an ice cream sandwich, with pistachio ice cream, the ice cream did not taste like pistachio. I did not leave happy, since the food was mediocre at best.

<review>I can imagine Gallagher's would be a great place to come for football games or other gimmicky nights.  I am not from the area so I came on business for lunch with a few associates.\n\nThe food was decent.  I had the chicken, potatoes, fries, and garlic bread.  The bread was different and pretty good (compared to anything on the east coast).  The fries were run-of-the-mill seasoned curly fries, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The best part about this place was, in my mind, the waitresses. Whoever the hiring manager is must have been a former manager for Hooter's, if you know what I mean. \n\nWith that said, i'd go here for the plethora of flat-screens and atmosphere, not really the food.

<review>"""Want to know a secret on how to waste nearly $50 in less than an hour? Come to RigaTony's! My husband and I live right down the street from here and watched as it was being built wondering what it would be. When we found out it was a RigaTony's I became disinterested. I have never eaten here and had no desire to, that is until my husband decided he wanted to try it. He knew it was an italian place and he likes to find new places where he can eat a bowl of pasta. I stalled going here as long as possible but Friday night I finally gave in and we went to dinner here. I think we came in around 6, which I guess is right before the dinner rush because there was no wait, but when we left less than an hour later there was a line out the door. And thank god we didn't have to wait because the people who line up to eat here are total fools.\n\nThe service was quick and our waitress was really friendly. That is the only reason this place gets more than 1 star. She was quick to bring us water and take our order. We decided on the portabello cloud as an appetizer, which sounded interesting. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and my husband ordered some seafood with pasta and cream sauce special that was being offered. Salad and bread comes with the meal and luckily I had read before hand that the salad comes with salami so I requested the salad without it. The only way that I can really describe this place is a lower quality Olive Garden. And I hate Olive Garden. The salad is basically the same with lettuce, red onions, tomato, black olives, and peppers, but instead of a decent italian dressing that I can stomach, this one is coated with cheese and a heavy dressing. I barely finished one serving, but I watched as the table across from me (two women and one child) devoured two bowls of it. Ugh. The bread was just ok. Its just bread. Our appetizer comes out and it was not what I was expecting. It was a portabello mushroom filled with cheese and a few smigens of tomato and spinach, deep fried and placed on top of a pool of basil cream sauce. If you don't care about fitting into your pants the next morning, this could be tasty. \n\nOur entrees were the same. Low quality Olive Garden fare. My $12 fettuccine was an embarrassment to the name. I make amazing fettuccine for less than $12 that can feed four people!! Do people actually come here and eat this garbage when you can make so much better at home?? And apparently there is flour in the sauce to make it thicker. Not necessary and made me lose my appetite quite frankly. My husband liked his meal at the restaurant but started to feel sick as we were leaving and we took our leftovers home but they ended up in the dumpster on the way into our house because we couldn't stomach the thought of eating this food again. When we got the bill and our total came to $40 I about passed out. I had to leave the tip in cash because I couldn't stomach the thought of adding more to our credit card. What a complete waste of money. The food was bad. Bad bad bad. Heavy, greasy, everything was covered in cheese or some kind of cream sauce. I hope this experience made my husband realize that food can be so much better. I hardly ate the next day just to counteract the amount of calories I ingested in this meal.\n\nOne more note. I know this is a \family restaurant\"""", but seriously. If your newborn baby is screaming its head off and the restaurant is full of people, please take the baby outside until it calms down. Its just downright rude when you let the kid scream in a place full of people who didn't come there to listen to your baby scream."""""""

<review>"""Not all that good, all things considered.\n\nI know one is begging for trouble when visiting a donut establishment 30 min before closing. A lot of the donuts were out of stock, which I have no gripe about. I don't exactly expect them to cook a whole bunch of fresh donuts at night when no one wants them. I do wonder what they do with the leftovers when they close, and two robust older men loitering in the lobby gave me a clue.\n\nThe whole vibe of the place was \we're closing soon\"""" which bothers me quite a bit. Chairs up on tables, and the counter jockey managing to work the phrase \""""we're closing soon\"""" into his first sentence to us. Right, I get it. But no, my experience should be the same as the person who came in at 7 am, sorry.\n\nWe got a dozen donuts from the paltry selection (it doesn't look like even at peak times they have that many different kinds of donuts) and even the ones we ate that same night tasted stale and gross. I got the sour cream donuts and they left a strange coating inside my mouth that took about 12 oz of scalding coffee to wash away. Yuck.\n\nThe only reason it isn't one-star is because I already somewhat lowered my expectations due to going at night. However, if as a business you don't want to give evening customers a 5-star experience, then just save us all the grief and close at noon."""""""

<review>(After not having a good experience at the other place owned by the same person...being insulted by bartender) My boyfriend and I wanted mexican food. The owner of both this place and Rythym and Wine, should reconsider the hiring process of the staff. We walked in around 8 pm, well before closing.

<review>"""I really don't even know where to start with this place.  I've lived in Central Phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was.  That's the only reason I didn't turn around and walk out upon entering.  The decor in this place is cluttered, old, and feels dirty.  They sell most of their \decorations\"""" and if you are looking for a basket from 1984 you will surely find one. The floors, the tables, the walls - everything just looks old and worn.  I don't find that particularly appetizing.  \n\nSo I figured, this place must make one hell of a sandwich to keep such a high reputation, and placed my order.  While very nice, the staff is s...l...o...w...  \n\nI ordered the briesciutto.  I figured brie, prosciutto, sun dried tomatoes - can't mess that up, right?  Wrong.  The French bread was hard as a rock and was way too much bread.  The sun dried tomatoes were huge, but overpowered everything else.  I couldn't taste the brie or the prosciutto.     For what I paid and what I've heard, I had expected much better.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience.\n\nMy overall recommendation: just go across the parking lot to Einstein's."""""""

<review>First time at Frank  and  Lupes in old town Scottsdale, heard this place can make a mean margarita, but I did not see any being made tonight....to say the least I was sort of stuck here, due to some prick of a cop....but that's another story.\n\nWalked into this place and it was quite busy, was actually quite surprised on how busy it was for 7pm on a Weds night. Lots of College football fans in their gear due to the game between the ducks and Auburn the day before, so I am assuming most of them were tourist.\n\nThere was no hostess, and after looking around I decided to mosey up to an empty stool at the bar, took the bartender/waiter a minute to see me, but once he did he was on top of things. \n\nGot a Corona and my chip and salsa on, not a big fan of the authentic chips, and the salsa was a bit watery, I got an extra side of sour cream and guacamole, the guacamole was good, large chunks of avocado in it. Sour cream was your run of the mill, after looking over the unimpressive and hard to read lettering on the menu...due to poor design.\n\nI decided after the chips maybe just to stick with what I had, so I got the nacho supreme with chicken. To say the least I was not impresses with any part of this dish except for the fact that it was huge...and the chicken was good...but there was not enough of it. \n\nTotal tab came to almost $25.00 for one beer and nacho supreme and a little extra sour cream and guacamole...RIP OFF!!!\n\nCould of got better nacho's at Filberto's in Phoenix for way cheaper.\n\nI would be willing to give this place another shot but to say the least I was not very impressed with it on this visit due to the lackluster food and high prices!

<review>This is at the top of my list of poor manicures/pedicures.  The first time I showed up, she had forgotten to write down the appointment I had scheduled weeks earlier and unapologetically could not get me in.

<review>"""Short Version\nIt looks like it was either a failed Texas Roadhouse or a very cheap knock off, either way Norterra has plenty more to offer without suffering here. \n\nFood is on a fast food level, all frozen fried/microwaved, if it wasn't for the service I would have given it 2 maybe a 3.  However my overall experience was just terrible. \n\nWaitress and Manager were clueless it took more than 55 mins from the time we gave our credit cards till the time we actually signed the check.   No Appology no comps, Manager seemed pissed that I would complain about being over charged and made us wait while they kept our cards. \n\nLong version\nOur waitress was very friendly and pleasant, we asked about HH drinks specially the wine. Now this isn't a place to go for fine wine we realize that, but when we asked which wines were on HH, we were told by our waitress that she didn't drink and didn't know the wines.... or how to pronounce them.... or which one was on HH. \n\nSo we decided to back track and order a BOGO vodka and soda and lime.... that confused our t-totaller for a minute.   We placed out order 3 appetizers.  \n\nOur first round of drinks came quick.  Then nothing for about 15-20 minutes.  Which is painful when you are left with a bucket of salted peanuts.   Finally I was able to order a another round of drinks, vodka and peach tea. \n\nMeanwhile we watched a everyone else get their main courses while we waited for our appetizers for another 10-15 minutes.  So we are now nearly 40 minutes since entering the place. \n\nFinally our 3 appetizers arrived via other servers, again our waitress was gone elsewhere. \n\nWe ate our appetizers which were so-so nothing special and not worth the calories and fat. \n\nWe received our check and i had been charged for 2 teas, so we questioned this and the waitress said it was a mistake she would fix it.   We gave her 2 cards to split the bill... 25 minutes later we flagged down the manager who said he would get this resolved. \n\nHe promptly brought us a new check.  \Hang on\"""" wheres our credit cards we gave over 25 minutes ago!!.   He went and found the waitress.  She presented us with a split bill finally but didn't take the tea off.   So I hunted for the manager and explained the mistake he said he would take care of it.   \n\nNow nearly 40 minutes had gone by and he presents me with one half of the bill and removed the $3 tea....?   \n\nNow I tried to explain that the folder I gave back to him had 2 slips in it to half the bill and he needed to redo the bill with the tea deducted....  The manager was clueless... finally brought us two checks but only one had the $3 removed... by this time we were so worn out and happy to see our cards back... it was 55 minutes since we handed them over that we paid, left a just tip for the service and left wondering what all the attraction was about.\n\nNo Appology no comps, Manager seemed pissed that I would complain about being over charged and made us wait while they kept our cards."""""""

<review>"""I preface this by stating I am half Vietnamese and almost every weekend I have Pho at my father's home. Nothing beats a homemade bowl of this beautiful broth, and I must admit that because I am spoiled with authenticity I tend to be a harsher critic.\n\nAt the same time, however, I do give most Vietnamese restaurants some slack. If you want good Pho, do not go to Dragonfly in Tempe. Please, please, please. Their bowl of Pho is incredibly small and they skimp majorly on the aromatics. Talk about a Pho foul. And what's with the shredded roast-like meat? Oh no, it's supposed to be circle wafers of rare beef. \n\nInstead, visit the Dragonfly in Mesa. That place rocks, and they have other authentic soups that the Tempe location does not have. Like the great soup, \mi\""""--that's egg-noodle-wonton heaven. The egg rolls are not good at either location, by the way. If you know the difference between Vietnamese \""""egg rolls\"""" or chai gois, and the fat, cabbage filled Chinese egg roll, then you can imagine how disappointed I was when they brought me some egg roll hybrid with a gross sweet and sour sauce. \n\nI'm glad to see a Vietnamese place on campus, regardless. And if others love it, more power to them and I hope it keeps good little ethnic places like Dragonfly open. Just know that there is way better out there!"""""""

<review>Okay, so I call this dentist because I was having excruciating pain in my mouth. She agreed to see me on a Saturday Which was a plus. After filling out all of the paperwork, I was shortly sent to the back, where I was told what was wrong with my teeth. She said I needed a fill but didn't really TELL me what was wrong. Before she put a full in, she started to numb my mouth. MIND YOU, with a sharp long needle she stuck in my gums without any warning and no form of communication. She just ordered me to open my mouth more. After about 5 minutes, she said the filling was done and pretty much told me to have a nice day. UH... My mouth was still in pain, a little worse from when I came in. I had to ask the receptionist to ask the dentist to prescribe me pain killers! No communication from the dentist at all. The receptionist was very kind at least. However, I will not be back here again. Sometimes, I can't always trust reviews.

<review>"""I was with a party of 5 on a Sunday afternoon at 12:30 PM.  There were two other tables occupied besides ours.  Bad sign.  Isn't that brunch time?   When our male waiter with glasses came to our table to give us our waters he said rather curtly \Don't touch\"""".  As if we were going to grab the glasses of water out of his hands....  Listen buddy, none of us were going to grab glasses of water out of your hands!!   That was really strange.  I've never been instructed to \""""Don't touch\"""" a beverage a server was setting down.   I've been warned nicely to not touch a hot plate many times.  Our party could not understand why he would say that to us when none of us had our arms stretched out to take the glasses of water from him.    \n\nThe food is fine, I'm glad a place like this exists in Scottsdale, but none of the dishes hit it out of the park.  The waffle with agave vanilla syrup tasted a bit too healthy to be deemed delicous.  The chili was very nicely flavored, but was overpriced $5 for tiny amount given. \n\nAlso, - warning parties of 5 or more!!  They include gratuity for you!  How very kind!  I am familiar with gratuity being added for parties of 6 or more, but was very surprised to see a $13 tip added to our $76 bill.  This wouldn't have bothered me much, but after being talked down to by the server in our first two minutes, I was more than peeved."""""""

<review>5 of us ate lunch there yesterday.  3 had burritos.  2 didn't.  The the three that had the burritos have been so sick all day today!!!  Vomiting, diarrhea, chills, aches.  Unreal.  My husband is a doctor and he reported this to the health department but they said they have to wait until more people report a problem!  We called the restaurant and they didn't seem to care.  My two sons and daughter in law are all still sick.  \nThey didn't eat anything but ice cream after the lunch and one son didn't even eat that.  So it had to be Frank  and  Lupe's.  I am so upset.  We drove home to CA with one son who was so sick in the car.  The sick ones are young healthy people.  Sure hope no children or old people eat there until they solve this problem!!!!!!

<review>Worst service at a Starbucks I have ever experienced.  Keesh was rude and I will never recommend nor go to that Starbucks ever again.  The sad thing is there are way too many Starbucks with friendly good hearted people for me to put up with this particular negative store.  The coffee is the same in every store so why not go to another Starbucks or even The Coffee Bean.  I was so disrespected they received a comment/complaint on the corporate website from me.\n\nOne chance is all they got.

<review>"""Beware!!! After putting up with George and his incompetent staff for over 6 long months I was happy when we said enough today.

Just a few more,,, his staff cleaned our filter on our flagstone, left our hose out and never rinsed the mess off. I witnessed his employee jumping over our gated wall, the day i fired him! What was this guy doing here? He said George asked him to stop by and find out why I let him go!!!, I asked him, by jumping over my wall??? What was this guy REALLY doing on my property??? Good thing I was home or our dog would have had a new chew toy! To this day I don't know how or why we put up with George, his sheisty demeanor or his staff as long as we did. Good riddance."""""""

<review>I really hate to do this, because I have been a fan of the Merc Bar for years, but its a must.  My fiance  and  I were looking for a place to entertain our wedding party the weekend before our wedding and it was clear to us that the Merc Bar would be the perfect place.  We love the atmpsphere.  It usually has a nice  and  mature crowd.  The service is usually good.  It was perfect.  \n\nUnfortunately, it was the management and not the lounge that ruined our perspective of the venue.  The manager (Tommy) was slow/nearly impossible to reach and even harder to get info out of.....i.e. Whats your process for group reservations. \n\nHe seemed annoyed that I conntact him and unwilling to make time for us.  After several incomplete emails he finally called me, at my request, but it became clear, after 5 mins on the phone, that he did not want our business.  It was also apparent that he lacked basic customer service skills.\n\nSince, the goal of the evening is relax  and  enjoy our time with our friends, not to worry about bad service, we took our covo with Tommy as a hint that the Merc Bar would not be a good fit.  We need a place with a more mature management staff.....so, we're going with the Montelucia.  Its a nice upscale resort, with an awesome spa, a very nice lounge  and  live music on Saturday night, a great pool  and  nice rooms.   Truly perfect.
</review>
<review>The bar is very nice and serves a great martini.  After that, it's downhill.\n\nWe waited for service as the couple next to us was seated, was brought an amuse bouche and ordered.  We still had not heard from our waiter.  We finally flagged down someone and they made a half hearted attempt to serve us and brought us menus.  At that point, we should have left.  But we did not.  Wanting this to be good, we preserved and waited for our waiter  to have some free time for us.  \n\nWhen he finally did show, he was abrupt and obviously slammed.\n\nSince none of us drank the same wine, we each ordered by the glass.  This did not seem to amuse our waiter in the least.\n\nThe steak was average...maybe below average for the price.  I left half my steak (which I NEVER have done before) on the plate and our waiter did not ask if we enjoyed our dinners.  This is inexcusable.  He did have the decency to not ask us if we wanted deserts.  The check, I might add, was brought promptly.  I could not help but wish I had gone to Mastros or Oceans - or the TPC Grill.\n\nBottom line - If you can entertain your waiter by placing an order for an expensive bottle of wine and meet his schedule for getting your order in, you stand a chance of having a very expensive about or below average dinner.  (Read expense account on boondogle).

<review>Went here with a friend recently after some golf... It was the second time I had been here.\n\nThe first time was probably some time last summer, and all I remember is that I was unimpressed.\n\nDecided to give it another shot, and ordered the Peak Burger.  This burger sounded like quite a nice sandwich, with andouille sausage, remoulade, ciabatta bread, etc.  I made sure to order it medium rare, but it was clearly cooked to well done, without even a touch of pink.  This, of course, left the meat nice and dry.  The bread was also overly crisp, and it was light on the sausage and sauce.  \n\nThe fries were excellent, but it was easily the most disappointing hamburger I have had in some time.\n\nA quarter of the way through the burgers (both of us ordered medium rare burgers, and both were well done), we notified the waiter.  He offered to have them remade, but we figured it wouldn't be worth the wait.\n\nOddly, we were not comped for the overcooked burgers.  Not even free fries, drinks, or anything.  No apology when he brought our checks...\n\nI'll give them a star for good fries and IBC root beer (though they could pick a better root beer).  But I'll pass on the underwhelming entrees and cold treatment.

<review>"""This review is for the brand new Los Favoritos located in Chandler on Alma School and Queen Creek Rds. Their location does not yet have a website listing as the 10 other locations do. I will admit, I am Mexican. I am a wonderful cook but even I like to take a break from cooking once in a while. I have been to many good taco stands and Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  I was SO disappointed in this place.  Sad, because it appeared to have good reviews. I will also admit that my husband (who is a gringo) and I both ordered different versions of Enchilada dinners.  Ok so here's my first complaint.  Unless you ABSOLUTELY ADORE green peppers, do NOT order their chicken enchiladas.  It should really be called a Green Pepper Enchilada with a bit of chicken thrown in.  Not only that, but gigantic chunks of onion.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out that those two ingredients are fillers so that they don't have to use as much meat.  My husband had a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada.  Hard to believe, but the cheese enchilada was full of green peppers also! My second complaint was the so called \guacamole\"""". It came in a 2 oz container and we were charged $1 for it.  That is ridiculous for two reasons: The small amount we were sold and the fact that it was some kind of fake pureed avocado. Guacamole implies that it should have onion and tomato, chilies, etc. in it..otherwise it is just pureed avocado.  Last but not least, they are very chintzy on the rice and beans. That is probably the cheapest thing for them to make and serve and yet we were lucky to get 2 ounces of each on our to-go containers.  As far as flavor, my husband, who is not Mexican, thought it was pretty bland, so so much for the authentic Mexican flavor.  That said, the price for the 2 Enchilada dinner was pretty low and now we understand why.  We will not be returning to this establishment."""""""

<review>This is easily the worst golf course I have ever played.  There are several problems with it:\n\nFirst of all, it's a desert course.  Not that there's anything wrong with desert courses, but on some holes, the fairway does not start until 150-200 yards off the tee.  That's fine on most courses, but on this one, if you don't hit the fairway, it'll be nothing but dirt and rocks.  No rough or anything.  On most long holes, if you mess up the tee shot, your hole is blown.\n\nSecond, the layout is dangerous, especially on the back nine.  There is one spot where three holes more or less converge, and you are right in the path of errant shots from not one or two, but three holes.  You have to keep your eyes open or you can get nailed.\n\nThird, there is no enforcement of pace whatsoever.  We played there during the summer, and there was a line at the tee for most of the front nine.  In all, the game took 5 1/2 hours to play, which is ridiculous.\n\nFinally, very few holes have yardage markers.  Combine this with no GPS, and it makes club selection very difficult, if not impossible.  It's tough to get an accurate measurement by eying it or using the scorecard.\n\nThe only redeeming part of this course is an island green on the sixth hole, although I should note that it appears as if nobody bothers to repair ball marks there.

<review>"""My wife and I found a living room and dining set for our new house that we love. The salesman was extremely helpful and offered us all of these great deals.  It is now two months later and we still don't have the complete purchase.  The dining room table top has been sent back twice (the delivery men say this happens \all the time\"""" due to damaged tops).  We were sent the wrong end tables.  The coffee table was damaged one delivery and smelled rancid the next.  That salesman we liked has a difficult time returning phone calls now too.  Fortunately, customer service has done their part to accommodate this circus of sending us seconds.  So much for a great deal.  \n\nSeven months later and we finally have all of the pieces for our family room...

<review>I've been to this hotel twice now.  Once in 2008 and again this year in June for a gaming convention.  Both times my experience at this hotel in regards to how we convention goers were treated was pretty poor, in my opinion.\n\nThe service in the restaraunt during breakfast was outstanding.  Then the B team took over the rest of the day as when I and other people of the convention had dinner there, it took us 2 hours to finish the meal as our waiter had to be forced to come to our table.  Our food was cold and made incorrectly for the most part.  Other people were served their food before us who had come in after we had been seated for over 45 minutes.  The manager showed up 25 minutes after we asked to speak with him and only comped one of our tabs.\n\nWe were also not able to use the room in which we held our games at as a socialization spot after games were called off and were pretty much restricted to our rooms.  This occurred both times I visited for the convention in Phoenix.  I will not be visiting a 3rd time if it's held at this hotel again.  Ultimately, I feel as if our group was treated like second hand citizens and not paying customers in their hotel.
</review>
<review>"""Soooooooo......\nI want to first start off by saying that the service was very good. Attentive and apologetic. And they offered to give us dessert on the house. Let me explain: we were super excited about trying a new place and based off of the yelp reviews this seemed like a slam dunk. The listing states that it is a quiet and intimate place. Not so. The music, while good, was really loud and the people drinking in the bar must have been mic'd because they were as loud as hell. One lady in particular favored the donkey style of laughter every ten minutes or so. That's fine, truly, it doesn't bother me. Neither does the fact that we waited over half an hour for our food to be served only to have it be wrong and returned. This was sadly due to a computer that must have been hungrier than us because it decided to eat all the orders. I'm a very patient person and, barring someone trying to punch me in the face, I don't get upset quickly. Such was the case here. My sister on the other hand....not so much. She was about ready to flip the table and go monkey fudge on the kitchen staff. But I digress, what bothered me most of all was the complete blandness of the food. All of it. Not only was it lukewarm, it really had no taste. And the \4 chili hot\"""" red sauce tasted like warmed ketchup. When we asked the waitress if they had any hot sauce, she didn't understand what we meant. She seemed completely baffled that we wanted something with a little flavor. We were very disappointed, but, because the wait staff was very nice I would have no problem giving them another chance. My sister....not so much."""""""

<review>I've taken my car here a couple of times and the first couple of experiences were great.  They were friendly and very customer service oriented (always have been for the most part).  Which makes me want to give them 3-4 stars.  \n\nHowever, this past spring, I took my car in for it's normal maintenance and an oil change.  I was leaving a for a long trip a couple of days later and told them this so they checked everything over thoroughly, made some recommendations on things that needed to be fixed and also showed me how to check my oil levels. \n\nA few days later, I drove to my destination in another state.  The following day, my passenger got in the car, she noticed a smell of oil that I hadn't noticed. I opened up the hood of my car only to find oil splattered all over the place and the oil cap lodged (luckily) in between some of the pipes in the engine. I was in a sheer panic and called the shop and left an urgent voicemail (It was evening) - not knowing what to do or whether the car was safe to drive.  There was little to no oil left in the tank.  \n\nThe next day I received a call and they just said just to fill tank with oil, clean the engine at the car wash and it should be ok.  They immediately defensive and were quick to say they didn't do anything wrong and that someone must have accessed my engine (within 2-3 days of the service?  really? i hadn't gone anywhere other than work and home and quick errands and i have a garage) or that I must've checked the oil and forgot to put the cap back on.  I basically told them that I wasn't interested in arguing about it...I just wanted to make sure that it was safe to drive 8-10 hrs back to the Phx area.  \n\nHowever, the whole experience left me with a bad taste in my mouth. As much as I would like to give them another chance because I honestly believe that they are not bad guys, they are relatively fair and that they do a pretty good job, If my car engine had been totally messed up after that fiasco - it was clear that they would not have taken responsibility for the fact that they forgot to put the oil cap back on.  I think it was pretty obvious that they made an honest mistake and I just think it lacks character and customer service to have not taken responsibility for their mistake.  They told me to bring it in when I got back and they would check it out, but at that point - why should I trust them?

<review>"""Went here on 1/2/12 to find out they were taking a 3-day weekend, so i came back today. THE PLACE WAS PACKED full of people wanting to return/exchange receivers as i was because i got fed up with not having the service being functional.\nthe only good things that actually came out of this 45 minute wait was getting a brand-new cisco receiver, which still didnt fix anything. called em up, and they refreshed the signal which helped for about 5 minutes before screwing up some more. now i have a scheduled technician visit tomorrow....it'll probably  either a crotchidy old man, or a younger man telling me to quit complaining because there are less fortunate people who dont have cable even though i'm paying dearly for my services. once again, i am VERY disappointed with cox communications. Wish me luck on the appointment!\n\n--UPDATE--\n\nthe Cox Tech (a stocky redheaded guy) finally got here an hour late, and comes in with a hell of an attitude, acting like he knew everything and the problem was my fault, blaming the receiver not cox as well as being told on the phone that he would bring cords and a ladder, upon getting here he said if it needed a new cord that i would have to schedule another time because he was on a schedule that didnt include that. after all this bullcrap and proving the box was not entirely the problem, he changed the head of one of the cords connected to my HD DVR it fixed the problem slightly. so he went and changed the receiver and blamed the receiver for being glitchy, new and giving off too much noise in the signal he finally got it working good enough he ran on out to his truck, started to leave and i realised he left one of the other tv's and the modem still unplugged. so i called him back in and upon repairing he growls and says \ god, im soo stupid, i left the other things unplugged.   i bet by now you think we probably just come in and fix one thing by breaking another, well thats not how we work.\""""..... pfffftt could've fooled me, upon fixing this issue he runs back out to his truck and takes off, and after getting a complaint from the watchers of two of the other tv's i call him back again and he came back in and fixed them.\n\nalso forgot to add, the third time he came in he blundered through my house knocking things down, including a once-expensive camcorder. but being the nice person i am, im going to overlook it.\n\nhe also said the new cisco Explorer 8642HDC (that cox is giving EVERYBODY) he said there is a well-known widescale issue with the recording and playback, and that there should be a fix within a week. sounds great, cox giving out a box that THEY KNOW is broken.\nonce again, i am very displeased with their service, customer service, and technicians. and i would most certainly not recommend cox to anyone."""""""

<review>I was going to give this place three stars and then realized there really isn't any reason to.  While it is cheap ($6 the night we went, with free nachos and soda), in this case you get what you pay for.\n\nThe rink surface was nice, but the roller skates were crappy, and the back of the place smelled like urine.  There is also no air-conditioning, just fans.\n\nIf you really want to go skating and are looking for an adventure, give it a shot.  If you're looking for a classy date spot, keep looking.
</review>
<review>I would love to comment on how good/bad their food was, but I can't. I showed up at 6:45pm, and they close at 7 per the sign I was looking at on their front window. However, they were closed when I got their, and the 2 girls standing there just randomly looked up at me while cleaning. I wanted to give them a shot for the first time, however, with them closing early and not acknowledging me about it when me and my friend where looking right at them, makes me not want to got back. What gives?
</review>
<review>"""So we walk in at 11:15 AM. and the place is completely empty. (This is during peak college year). The disappointment of not seeing any hot ASU broads was only the beginning of a variety of disappointments during this lunch. So lets start with the good. The waitress was nice. Ok, now the bad: I ordered the lunch special pizza which was an 8 inch pizza and a drink for like $6. The waitress warned me that the pizza \was extremely small\"""" (at least i think she was talking about pizza) so anyways i ordered 2 of them. When the pizza came out, I wouldn't have been surprised if i saw part of a Digornos pizza box stuck to the bottom of the pizza. What is wrong with pizza in Arizona?! I've never been to big city where saying the word \""""Domino's\"""" causes very moist orgasms.  Mellow Mushroom tries way too hard with the crust, they sprinkle this garlic dust all over it and it sucked. It tasted like you were trying to eat an old shiny piece of bread. The cheese was so thick and rubbery, you could probably use it to cover severe war wounds  This place blew big ones, it had cool decorations on the walls, but i can't  friggin eat decorations."""""""
</review>
<review>We had dinner in the old room next to the Bar area.  The food was fine but the service was pretty painful.  It was one of those dinners where to get the next thing we had to flag down our server or someone else.  I ordered a cocktail and waited almost 15 minutes for it to arrive.  We had to ask for bread and for the cocktail glass to be removed and for another wine glass to be brought and we had to ask for several other things as well.  It is hard to enjoy dinner and company when you are waving at servers all the time.
</review>
<review>Much of their services do not provide any real relief to back pain.  The services involved a heat treatment with tens machine and then stretching by Dr. Baca.  All of these things can be done at home and you save a copay.  He will try to get you on other services not needed to get more money into the practice.  He is one of very few that offer MUI services but most insurance providers do not cover so proceed with caution as they will tell you its 100% covered. The back office people are very non responsive, atrocious,  in calling back when questions are asked for insurance coverage.  What they will tell you is that it is covered only to find out from your health care provider that Triad never called.  Bottomline, don't waste your time/money on a service that does nothing when there are many more experienced chiroprators out there.

<review>I remember we visited this restaurant more than a year ago and whatever we ordered was decent,  (my memory plays tricks on me). Well, we decided to go there on 4th of July, and it was a rude awakening for me. I don't know how one person can possibly eat their appetizer and a main dish. The prices are not cheap (for this kind of a restaurant), so Brio Tuscan Grill tries to please people by serving non-human portions. \n\nOur friend ordered one of their salads ($15!) - it was such a disturbing mess on that plate. I think they put every vegetable and fruit they had in the kitchen. Then I received my bruschetta - it was ok, but too much of everything on top plus I would prefer less balsamic vinegar. If you ever had bruschetta in rural Italy, I can tell you that this was not even remotely close to real Italian bruschetta. Of course, I got 5 big pieces for an appetizer. My spicy shrimp with eggplant was drenched in oil and eggplant was too bready. I ordered it instead of a main course, but couldn't finish it. My husband got himself lasagna. Ok, this was the final straw. Come on, you could feed at least 3 people (and I'm being modest). Lasagna was just ok, but I couldn't stand to look at the portion and the sauce, which came straight from a can. \n\nWhat is going on? Why are they oversizing everything? I felt as if I was an animal brought to a feeding before being slaughtered. Apparently, it is just me, because the restaurant was full, and it looks like a lot of people on Yelp really enjoyed it. I won't spend my money there anytime soon, but if you're willing to give it a try, share your main dish or expect to take it with you (considering you like it)\n\nOn the positive side, the decor is pretty and their booths are comfortable.  My husband really liked their artichoke and spinach dip. The service was nothing to rave about.\n\nBtw, what kind of Italian menu  has lobster bisque on it? I thought lobster bisque was 100% French
</review>
<review>"""A friend of mine recently invited us to join for his birthday dinner at Fogo. My initial thought was \what am I going to be able to eat here?!\""""  but was assured that their salad bar was \""""banging\"""".  So, alas we arrive and the woman and I hit up the bar while we waited for our peeps.  She got a really great dark beer and I tried to go outside of the box and ordered a melon martini.  It was terrible, but I didn't want to send it back cause it was kind of my own fault.  The bartender, however, noticed my full glass and asked if there was something else he could get for me.  Thank you sir!!!  I got a glass of Malbec instead, and it was great.  Our friends arrived, and we were seated.  It was like a whirlwind of craziness after.  Our server twirled on over and explained super fast how the place worked and what it was all about.  He went around asking what we all wanted to drink, and when he got to my lady, he called her sir...annoying.  She clearly is a woman.  Whatev, stuff happens sometimes when you're high on meat fumes.  After he was done with our drink order, we all got up to grab some salad.  Now, I know that this place is a meat house, but if you're gonna charge me 23 bones for my salad bar, please, make it great!  I grabbed some lettuce and started walking around to see what else I wanted.  There were these huge asparagus piled high, so I grabbed a few.  Then I grabbed some green beans, huge beet slices and broccoli, too.  I went to the dressings and was kind of disappointed.  There were ranch, caesar, and what looked and tasted like zesty Italian from Kraft. Boo.  Everything looked really good, but nothing was seasoned at all.  I mean, I appreciate being given the option to season my own items, but plain bland everything?  I want some flavor people!  \n\nOnce seated, meat on sticks came from every direction.  It's kind of funny to watch.  Two of my dining companions ordered limeades, and no joke, had to ask for refills from multiple people (at least four times!) before someone came by with a pitcher.  \n\nThe boyfriend of the birthday boy decided to propose that evening, and asked them to please bring the ring out on the dessert plate, and they did so very well.  I'll give them a star for that.  It was cute and sweet, both literally and figuratively.  I just ordered an after dinner coffee for my dessert, and everyone seemed please with their treats.\n\nUgh, then when it came time to pay, we decided that I would put $100 on my card and the rest was in cash.  When someone FINALLY came by to pick up the bill, I explained this.  He looked very confused. So, I repeated \""""Just 100 on the card and the rest cash.\"""" Simple enough, right?  Not so much.  It literally took about ten minutes for someone else to bring our monies back and when they did, the guy used all the cash and put the remainder of $61 on my card (I'm just glad is wasn't more than what I asked him to put on)...but still, I serve bro! It's not hard to do!\n\nI was completely underwhelmed by my experience here and do not plan on returning.  At least I won't suffer from any meat sweats.\n\nNEXT!"""""""

<review>"""I can only do three things to my hair: straight, regular curls, or up in a clip/ponytail. My 5 year anniversary was coming up so I thought it would be fun to have someone style it for me before my fancy dinner date with Hubby. It turned out to be an irritating experience. \nI planned my whole day around this appointment (4 P.M.). I hate being late to anything, so I booked it over to the Drybar and arrived right on time. The thing was, they were not on time. FAR from it. I was asked my name and then told that I would have to wait 10 minutes. 10 minutes later I was asked my name again and told to still wait. Almost 5 minutes later I was asked what my name was AGAIN and told to wait. I should have put on a name tag. This time I was told that a party came in 20 minutes late so everyone was running behind. I wanted to say \that's not my problem, how are you going to make it better?\"""" but I like to see how good a business is by seeing how they deal with problems and how much they appreciate business. Their way: do nothing. \nSo 30 minutes after my appointment time (and me stewing and starting to freak out if I have enough time to get all the way home in traffic, change, do my makeup, and get to the restaurant on time), they FINALLY call me back.\nThe girl takes me to the back sink and asks which hair style I want. They have a \""""menu\"""" of about 6 hairstyles. I said the Mai Tai. She said \""""Mai Tai?\"""" I think to myself \""""damn it, it just gets worse.\"""" I say \""""yes, the beachy look.\"""" So she said \""""Oooooh, the one with loose big curls?\"""" I respond with \""""sure\"""" (while I mentally roll my eyes wondering what she is going to do to my hair). She washes my hair and brings me to the chair. The one good thing about this girl is that she didn't talk much, which I like since I hate trying to hear someone talk while a blowdryer is making loud noise in my ear. While drying my hair she asks which side I part my hair. I said \""""My bangs go this way\"""" while I make a motion with my hand the way my bangs go. She parted it on the other side. I see a lot of the stylists have cute feathers in their hair so I ask about them. She told me they are fast and easy to do, so I say I'll go for a few. She finished styling my hair, which did NOT look beachy (my hair was frizzy at the top instead of smooth, and my curls were medium sized...which I could do myself...for free). It seemed like every customer was getting the same hairstyle (they looked like the \""""southern comfort\"""" style). I saw NO ONE that had anything different which makes me wonder why they even have a menu if you don't even get a choice. I was running out of time and thought maybe the cute feathers would save the look and make it look different than what I can do myself. Nope. The feathers were thin and she said she was going to put them so I can pull them out or hide them if needed. She put them under so much of my hair and they were so thin I could hardly notice them. At this point I was just done and wanted to leave asap because it was just a disaster. I kept the extensions in for 2 weeks, and not a single person noticed them because she put them under so much hair. I will never go back and just stay with my regular stylist. \nLong story short: horrible customer service and an obnoxious experience."""""""
</review>
<review>"""Holy poop, they are sooooo slow. They tell you it will take 20 minutes, and you're there for over an hour. The only chance you'll get fast service is if you're the only one there. They will also try to sell you extra crappy services you don't need (wait, everyone does this). However, they quoted me $70 (I knew I needed some extra crappy service), charged me $120, and then \did me a favor\"""" by taking 20 bucks off. $100 for an oil change and changing light bulbs. That's very effed of you, jiffy lube. I should have given you the new bulbs back and gone to an auto parts store to buy my own d*mn bulbs. ARGH."""""""

<review>I used to really love this place and came often and would have given 4 stars. I forgave the horribly unkempt entrance that is liken a Van Buren back alley because they had terrific food and drink specials all the time. But unfortunately all good things must come to an end and this place is no exception.The quality of sushi has taken a nose dive, and the service is borderline abusive. On our last visit I was going to speak to the manager but realized she was too busy giving a server a back rub at the sushi counter. Shame on you Sakitini.
</review>
<review>i will never go back to this place!  terrible service!!! here is what got me; we ordered a 2nd round 10 min. before happy hour was to end only to have the lazy and terrible server come over and asked if we wanted another round.  we politely reminded him that we ordered the round prior for the happy hour special.  he slowly brought us our drink and when we got our bill... guess what? we were not charged the correct price.  he used the excuse that the computer did it and that he couldn't change it.  we again reminded him that if he had brought us our drinks in a timely manor the computer would not have charged us more.  he then said he'd buy us one of the glasses.  what a jerk! please it isn't coming out of your pocket, do your job correctly!  so here is my take, this place is a copy cat of many others.  go to the places with great service and spend your money there. don't waist your time here with these rude people!
</review>
<review>"""Alright, I've waited until I settled down before I wrote this.  It's about a new establishment that opened in Surprise, Uptown Alley.  My wife and I used to be in several bowling leagues and sponsored several teams.  Then, we moved to Surprise.  I was excited when I heard about a bowling alley opening in Surprise.\n\nMy daughter was celebrating her 32nd birthday.  We thought what a wonderful way to check out this new place.  First, dinner at the RED EMBERS with a few cocktails, opening presents with a few more cocktails, a birthday cake and a few more cocktails, followed by a few lines of bowling for the entire family (Party of 8), and possibly having in a few more cocktails.  This ain't gonna be no cheap date.\n\nTo make things easier, and to add an element of surprise, we decided to take the custom birthday cake we had made to the restaurant where we were to have dinner.  That way, they could serve it for dessert, surprise my daughter and really embarrass her with \HAPPY BIRTHDAY\"""".  We have done this several times, at many restaurants.  \n\nMy wife takes the cake to the restaurant and is told they can't accept it.  After a brief conversation, she returns home, and not very happy.\n\nI call the restaurant, ask for the manager, and engage in a very long conversation.  I explain we're neighbors, this is our first experience with their place, it's my daughter's birthday, etc.  She blames County regulations for this decision.  I inform her that every other establishment we have gone to with this has gladly accepted and served.  She stands on her denial, based on County regs.  I inform her that my wife has several years in Food and Beverage management, including many years at Arrowhead Country Club, and that no regulation exists.  She stands firm.\n\nNot to upset the daughters, my wife and I continue as planned.  The food was okay.  Mark, our server was good.  I believe, as an attempt to pacify, our server comped a birthday brownie after dinner.  Too little, too late.\n\nAs for the bowling experience, again so-so.  Too dark and too noisy.  Ghetto boys in the lane next to us did not enhance the experience.  We had our Grandchildren there and the language and actions from our neighbors was deplorable.\n\nThanks for ruining a special day for our family!!!!!!!!"""""""
</review>
<review>My parents took me here when I was visiting them in AZ.  I think they love the fact that the beers are cheap...which is nice.  But, I thought the food was fair.  My burger was greasy and over-cooked.  I think the fact that they serve the burgers on paper plates is fine but the place is just DIRTY - I didn't even want to think about the kitchen.  If you go here, DONT even go in the bathrooms - they are totally gross!
</review>
<review>I've been wanting to go here for years from hearing such great things and finally made the pilgrimage out to Tempe. I have to say it was a total let down. I met a friend there for lunch and ordered the special of the day. The special consisted of a tiny cup of mushroom rice soup (smaller than the capuchins cup,about 3oz) and a tiny 4 inch chicken sandwich. The soup was ok and the sandwich was bland. The sandwich was burnt black at the bottom and consisted of about 3 shreds of chicken and a thin layer of cream cheese. I can't believe they served it to me and I am not one to complain or send things back so I didn't say anything. \nI wanted to try their macaroons but after having such a dissapointing lunch I didn't even bother. \n\nAll in all, crappy food at a such a high price. Will never go back!
</review>
<review>There are alot of negative labels people throw on England and English culture, some true and some unfounded. Some of these are: poor weather, poor food, and poor women. If this place were actually British, you could throw on poor service as well.\n\nGreat location, poor service. They've got a pretty good selection of beers to choose from but the thing that kills this place for me is the service. I had to go up to the waitress to give my order and go to the cashier to pay my tab. It's not like the place was busy either. The only time she came to our table was to serve us our drinks. What's worse is that she just had an attitude the whole time too. It's a shame this place sucks because the area it's in is cool, as is the antique house it operates out of. Do yourself a favor and go hit up some other bar like Hanny's or even the bar across from this place.
</review>
<review>Heard many good things about this place and went last night for the first time for a dinner I organized with 6 friends.  It will probably be my last time there.  The interior is oddly laid out and somewhat cold, and we were seated at a table between the front door and the bathroom, about 5 feet from each.  Our waiter took our dinner order without writing any of it down.  He immediately repeated the order back to us, getting it wrong.  Then he reappeared 10 minutes later to confirm our orders once again.  Dude, write them down already!  The portions were tasty but very small for the price, and it would have been nice to have more than one tiny piece of dry bread.  Perhaps, even the option of butter?  But the service was my greatest complaint.  Even though the restaurant was only half full, people were wandering around like zombies looking for their waiters who had disappeared completely.  Our waiter kept interrupting our table's single conversation without making any effort to be graceful about it....yes, there is a right way to do it without seeming obtrusive.  And the men's room desperately needed some cleaning and attention.   \n\nWanted to like PastaBAR very much, but probably won't waste any more time on it.
</review>
<review>Looking at the schedule of the resort activities upon arrival, we learned that Wednesday was a cowboy sing-along. No, I'm not shitting you. I love my family and we had a great time being with each other, but that really epitomized our opinion of this hokey old-person resort. \n\nIf you have a timeshare somewhere like Vegas or the Poconos, this place might be worth your while to swap. For us (a family that owns our timeshare in Maui), it was quite a downward step. \n\nThe room was smaller than our unit in Hawaii, which made little sense; it wasn't dirty, but also didn't feel as clean as other properties we've been to; a light was burned out in our room and the maintenance people neglected to fix it; and the workout room smelled like formaldehyde. \n\nThe Marriott hotel across the way, however, is ridiculously luxurious. So if you're not bound to renting through the timeshare, you should stay over there instead. If you are bound to the timeshare, you can still use their pools, which is well worth it.
</review>
<review>This place needs to close their doors, get their act together, and then reopen. The atmosphere is boring and it is obvious that they did the bare minimum coverup from the last restaurant. The food is horribly boring and has no flavor. I ordered the chicken and avocado pizza and it literally tasted like nothing! We also got the nachos (which was actually just a plate of chips with one tiny pinch of cheese and soggy beef). In addition, the server didn't put in my order for my pizza, hardly apologized and then brought it to me 30 minutes after my friends were done eating. One of my friends ordered the ahi tuna and it was switched with someone else's special order so that had to go back to the kitchen and be reordered as well. The only thing I liked was the beer, and that too took forever and I had to remind my server several times to get me a refill. Way to much effort to get food and drink that is sub par at best.
</review>
<review>Let me start by saying the coffee is great! The donuts at this location suck though. Usually dry and just bad. I live down the street and have tried this location 30 + times and I can honestly say they have a terrible product. I mean come on, donuts is what you guys do and you are not doing it very well. If you want to taste a real doughnut so you know what you should be making go stop by Bosa or even a Bashas. Service is always good and the coffee is great but the name is not Dunkin Coffee...get it together people.

<review>"""Buyer beware of the \Lifetime Warranty\"""" on the Ghost Armor for your phones. I had it installed on my iPhone a few months after I purchased it. Within two weeks it was bubbling and falling off so I took it back.\n\nIts painfully slow for them to go through the process and each time was left wandering the store for nearly 30 minutes waiting for them to finish. Thankfully there's plenty to explore for me but the kids were getting grumpy.\n\nFlash forward 6 months and my Ghost Armor is again bubbling, scratched and falling off. I took the phone back in and now I have to pay another $10 \""""service charge\"""" to have them replace it. What the...? \n\nThat's a nice little scam. Every 6 months you gotta go back and pay another $10 to get the Ghost Armor fixed. Sort of like buying razors and having to go back every few months and pay for refills.\n\nI know its not a lot but the original install was $30 so another $20/yr to maintain it is annoying.\n\nThat said, the store is beautiful. Its clean, spacious, a huge selection and my family and I buy all of our electronics (computers, televisions, cameras, etc) and many of our movies and accessories here. \n\nJust stay away from the Ghost Armor and you'll be set."""""""
</review>
<review>I have been comming to this place for 6 months now. Food and resturant seemed great until my last visit when there was a beetle in my salad, saw it when i was about to take last bite of my plate! I am pregnant and have a toddler who was eating it too. The owner was just blaming it on the lettus supplier. He didn't give me my money back, just said he will take care of me next time, well there wont be a next time!!!
</review>
<review>First impression: needs paint  and  maintenance outside. The cherry vanilla candle at the front desk stunk and air inside was not circulated.  No elevator. Smoking rooms not segregated so smoke drifted in. Chair was stained, carpet didnt look clean. Fridge was unplugged and mildewed.\n\nI booked 2 but only stayed 1 night. Pushpa Patel kindly confirmed via email a refund for second night, backed up by Amex dispute service if necessary. Book using Amex only if you want to be sure of getting a refund\n\nWould not stay again until this place is remodeled.\n\n.

<review>"""The only good thing about this place is the location. It's less than a block away from US Airways Arena.\n\nWe decided to eat at this Pizza joint because we just finished watching Disney on Ice and my nephew was hungry. The guy behind the counter was very rude and pushy on selling his \Combo Deal\"""" which includes a Slice of Pizza, Salad and a Drink for $5.50. I told him I didn't want to order the Combo deal but wanted to order a Whole Pie.He says it takes about 45 minutes to make a Whole pie. Answer me this: What Whole Pie takes 45 minutes to make? Since, he made it seem that  I had no other option, so instead I ordered 5 slices and two soft drinks. Each slice had to be reheated in the oven. It took 15 minutes til our pizza was finally ready to eat .At least, that's what I thought.  The Pizza was extremely hot, greasy and tasteless. I wish I read the reviews prior and would've just waited to eat somewhere closer to home with better pizza."""""""
</review>
<review>"""so I have been shopping here for the last couple of years, basically since they have opened. I have spent hundreds, maybe thousands in that time on knives, camping gear, fishing equipment, etc. However I have just recently became involved in shotguns and firearms. The last 2 visits were the last 2 I will make to the store. Went in to ask about a pistol and the old short white haired guy was stuck up and arrogant and even laughed at one of my questions. At that point I just walked away. Went in yesterday for some 12 ga. Ammo. Stood in line in the firearms area for 20 MINUTES!! Just to ask their opinion on some hd shells. Was met with the overall \I'm too busy just to answer questions\"""" type of attitude from everyone. I will take my business now to cabelas, dicks, big 5, even ctd in texas before bass pro shop get another penny from me."""""""
</review>
<review>If you know what you need and don't expect any expertise or service then by all means go for it. \nWe have spent thousands of dollars here at best buy and hundreds of it on their extended service plans but the geek squad is a joke, these guys don't know what they are doing and try to turn their errors into yours...Oh and if something is wrong be sure to plan on DOUBLE the amount of time to even have someone look at your equipment that knows what they are doing...Good luck.
</review>
<review>The food may be good, but I wouldn't know since this place asked me to wait for over two hours to be seated for a table for three.  To be fair, we went in on a Friday night around 7:00 with no reservation.  There were quite a few people waiting for tables and the restaurant was overflowing with people.  I placed my name in with the hostess and was informed it would be a 45-55 minute wait.  Fair enough - seems like a reasonable amount of time to wait on a Friday with no reservations. We wasted time by walking around Scottsdale Quarter and having a juice drink at True Food. We ventured back to Sol and were able to find a spot at the bar.  I had the skinny margarita, which was tasty enough, but nothing special. My guy had the house margarita and he said it was average.  After an hour of waiting, I went to check on our table. The hostess said it would be another 25 minutes for our table to be ready.  We were enjoying the people watching, but growing hungry nonetheless. We decided to wait sice we had already waited this long.  After another 35 minutes, my beau, who is not as rational as I am, went to speak to the hostess and was told it would be yet another half hour. At this point we were looking at a two hour wait with no end in sight. How could we trust them not to ask us to wait another 30 minutes? We left, but not before my cranky guy chewed out the manager. Maybe you could chalk this up to the growing pains of a new restaurant, or the inability of a young staff to properly gauge the wait and manage their tables, but my experience left me thoroughly disappointed and I will not be going back to try the food any time soon.
</review>
<review>More to come from the 5 other yelpers in my party who had the same experience as I did.  I just wanted to beat them all to the punch.  To sum up what they will say in what I'm sure will be great detail:\n\n1. The good-not-great, reasonably priced brunch food was totally betrayed by the most inept service of all time.  \n2. Now reading a bunch of other reviews here I see this isn't an uncommon story.\n3.  Most of the drinks we had were good, including bloody maries, but make your own mimosas by buying champagne and a side glass of OJ.
</review>
<review>Well I decided to give this place another chance since I really do like the food. I ended up taking a friend thinking it would be a better experience but I was sooooo wrong. I don't know what is with the women that work there but they suck at customer service. I ended up having to ask the young man that works there to take our order after three other tables that had arrived way after we arrived had recieved their food before our order was even taken. He was great as usual but it still didn't  make up for the poor service we recieved that night. I will not be returning to that place ever again and I plan to speak to the owner if I can. So if you like bitchy women who neglect you and leave you starving  and  watching others eat then this is your place.
